the childrens friend maurice my dear son do not let the news that i am going to communicate afflict you too much i wish i could conceal it from you but i cannot your father is dangerously ill and without a miracle in his favor we must lose him o heavens my heart is ready to burst when i think of his affliction for these six days i have not closed my eyes and am now so weak that i can scarcely hold my pen you must come home immediately the servant who delivers you this letter will return with you your father desires earnestly to see you maurice my dear maurice if i could embrace him before i die he has repeated a hundred times in the day would to heaven that you were here now however do not lose a moment in packing up your things and i have ordered the man to make all possible expedition every moment will be an age of anxiety to me until i clasp you in my arms adieu my dear child may the lord protect you from all dangers on your journey i wait your return with the most lively impatience and am  your ever affectionate mother cecilia lavington oxford  dear cousin i have now no other friend but you to apply to and from you alone i can hope for comfort in a misfortune too weighty for me to bear heaven has deprived me of what was dearest to me on earth my beloved husband you know how sincere and tender an affection i bore him this day sennight he desired me to send for our son from school when maurice was brought up to his bed he stretched out his hand to him and had scarcely given him his blessing before he expired with him is gone all the satisfaction and happiness of my life you see me now plunged into a situation the most distressful and afflicting to a woman and a mother yet if i suffered alone i could bear it but my poor son sighs by my side he is not yet sensible of the misfortune of being an orphan it wounds my heart to see him look up to me with tears in his eyes while he presses my hand and speaks of his father none but a mother can have an idea of so afflicting a sight i think at those times that i read in his looks these melancholy words it is you alone my dear mother that must maintain me now wherever i go he is at my side and wipes the tears from his little eyes with my gown sorrow stops my voice when i would comfort him for the very sight of my child renews all my afflictions how shall i maintain him my poor husband has left me nothing and my hands are too feeble to work to whom then shall i look for assistance unless to you on you alone i rest all my hopes heaven i doubt not will dispose your heart to relieve a destitute and forlorn widow and to prove that the ties of blood which unite us are sacred i give up my son to your care whatever kindness you show to him i shall receive as performed for my sake and for the memory of a man who loved you all the strength and spirits that i have left i will exert to gain myself a livelihood by working but to bring up my son properly is beyond my power i give him up therefore to you entirely however sevee it may be to part with my child i must yield to necessity in the mean time i comfort myself in the reflection that i rely on the favor of a merciful god and the kindness of a worthy relation be you to him as a father and enable him one day to soften my afflictions i am unable to proceed my tears which wet my paper show you sufficiently what my heart feels you have it in your power to determine my happiness and the wellbeing of my son god will for ever bless your liberality he will reward you even in this world for your kindness to two unfortunate relations i am dear cousin  your disconsolate kinswoman etc cecilia lavington oxford  madam yours of the  th inst in which you inform me of your husbands death has given me the sincerest affliction you may be assured i partake of your grief and feel still more for your loss than for my own yet i must confess i cannot help being a good deal surprised that you think of applying to me alone for assistance is it absolutely necessary that your son should have the education of a scholar and add another to the number of halflearned smatterers that are already in the world are there not many other professions in which he may render as great services to society and labor to more advantage for his own interest consider with yourself how without fortune or friends will he be able to advance himself you know the world too well to make it necessary for me to show you that such an attempt would be impracticable on the other hand it would be unpleasing to yourself to see him chargeable to strangers you speak of the ties of blood but my own family which is very numerous puts me more forcibly in mind of them and i beg you to believe that it is with great difficulty i can maintain them in a suitable manner to load myself with an additional burden is absolutely out of my power and i am convinced that upon more mature reflection you will dispense with my doing so all that i can do is to put your son apprentice to a mercer at rochester a mr durant with whom i have concerns in business i promise you he shall be well treated there you may send him upon trial for some time and if approved he will take him without a fee consider maturely of my offer and let me know your determination and your sons if he resolves to go to the university it is absolutely out of my power to maintain him there i request you to accept the enclosed order for four guineas as a proof of my concern for your present distressed situaation and to believe me  madam etc london  dear sir i cannot forget the care that you and mrs masters took of me while at your academy though i have at present scarcely strength to write you these lines of acknowledgement but my mama who sits by me crying is unable through grief to take pen in hand and has said that task on me who am so unfit for it however from remembering your constant kindness to me i find some satisfaction in writing to you though i may succeed but indifferently you are already informed i suppose of my papas death ah sir what you foretold me is not come to pass you bid me not to be uneasy that i should perhaps when i came home find my papa out of danger but alas he is dead my mama is now a poor widow and i an orphan i dreaded no less as i came near our house i had fallen asleep in the chaise and dreamed that my papa was in heaven and that he took me by the hand and spoke to me at this i awoke and in waking seemed to hear the passing bell toll yet we were not near the house and had more than three miles to go yet at last when i arrived my mama was at our door waiting for me all in tears she kissed me and took me up stairs to my papa who was in bed and almost speechless when i kissed him oh dear how i cried and sobbed at this he opened his eyes and seeing me laid his hand upon my head and gave me his blessing but in so faint a voice as scarcely to be heard ah you cannot imagine how my mama and i cried all his neighbors and acquaintance were in tears too at his funeral but mama and i more than any body i begin to eat and drink a little but my mama has absolutely taken no nourishment so that she is as pale as death and i beg of her continually not to die for then i do not know what would become of me in this world ah dear sir you may imagine how great a trouble it is to mama and me that i am not able to continue my education but it cannot be otherwise and i must be content my mama has written to her cousin in london who is a rich merchant to request him to maintain me at school but he will not and he says that i shall be no better than a halflearned smatterer for my part i think i might have learning enough if my mother had the tenth part of his money but no i must go apprentice to mr durant the mercer at rochester i cannot tell you how much that grieves me mama strives to comfort me and tells me that it is a reputable line of business and that i may make a fortune by following it with application but what does all this signify when one dislikes it you know dear sir that learning was all to me i wished to be as good a scholar and divine as my papa before i had always a book in my hand now i shall be employed measuring silks with a yard but i must hold my tongue since it cannot be otherwise dear sir i wish you happiness and shall always think of you i hope too that you will not forget me and thank you again for your kind treatment of me i suppose mr durant will seldom take me to london so that as i pass there in my way to rochester i shall go and see you and mrs masters and if ever i come into great business you shall take whatever you please in my shop without paying a farthing only try you shall see meantime i am and ever shall be  dear sir as you used to call me your little friend maurice lavington oxford  maurice mrs lavington oxford maurice ah mama the stage is ready to set off   mrs lav in tears my dear child are you going then to leave me   maurice pray mama do not cry so or i shall be dull all the journey where are my gloves ah they are on my hands i do not know what i am doing   mrs lav what pain it is to part with you i will accompany you at least a little way out of town   maurice nay dear mama you are already so ill and so weak   mrs lav it is but half a mile my dear   maurice but you know the doctor says that you must take care of yourself if you were to come home worse and be obliged like my pap to take to your bed and die i should be the cause of it no you must not stir out or else i will not go   mrs lav well my dear child then i will stay   maurice yes mama do not move out and when i am gone he down on the bed and try to rest   mrs lav oh i wish i could   maurice good bye good mama   mrs lav god bless you and watch over you my dear child

every week mama and will you write to me too   mrs lav can you ask that i shall now have no other pleasure upon earth but shall we ever see each other again in this world   maurice oh yes we shall see each other again i will take care to behave so well that i will get leave to come and see you in six months but mama the stage is going off i must leave you   mrs lav one kiss more my dear child farewell they wave their hands until out of sight   mr durant mr durant maurice rochester what do you bring me there my little gentleman   maurice a letter sir my name is lavington i suppose you know what it concerns   mr durant oh you are little lavington i am glad to see you i like your face very well have you a taste for business   maurice sighing why yes sir   mr durant you have been some time

accounts how much is   times     maurice    and   times    make     and   times     make  stop a moment  make      and add    to the it makes      exactly the present year of our lord   mr durant how why you cast accounts like a banker i shall be glad to have so clever a little boy behind my counter   maurice i hope sir i shall give you satisfaction   mr durant according as you behave yourself   maurice sir i ask no better   mr durant i make no doubt but we shall be good friends   maurice o sir you shall never have reason to find fault with me i love my mama too well to run the risk of grieving her   mr durant come then i will introduce you to my wife and children i have two much about your age   maurice i hope sir to gain the regard of all your family   lady abberville maurice maurice carrying a piece of satin rolled up your servant madam mr durant gives his compliments to your ladyship and sends the twelve yards of satin of the pattern that you showed him you know the price madam   lady abber he asked me thirteen shillings at the first word that is something dear   maurice have you a measure in the house madam   lady abber mr durant is an honest man i never measure after him how much does it come to   maurice seven pounds sixteen shillings madam   lady abber that is a good deal of money has he ordered you to receive it   maurice that is as your ladyship pleases   lady abber well there are seven pounds sixteen shillings i shall call on him for a receipt but if i were disposed to cheapen cannot you abate me something   maurice yes madam mr durant told me that i should abate a shilling a yard   lady abber well my little boy that is very honest i am perfectly well pleased with your sincerity let me see that makes twelve shillings   maurice yes madam i have twelve shillings to return you   lady abber keep them yourself my little friend this is my birthday and i will make you a present of them   maurice madam i beg pardon i cannot take them   lady abber you shall it is my property and i give it to you   maurice perhaps mr durant would take it amiss   lady abber that is my concern i shall make that up   maurice madam i return you a thousand thanks this money shall not stay long in my pocket i will send it off directly to my mama and mention your ladyship to her in my letter i shall go and write it immediately   lady abber no no i must not let you go so fast i see that we have a good deal to say to each other tell me in the first place who is your mama and where does she live   maurice ah my poor mama is widow to a clergyman of oxford my papa is dead these two months he was too charitable to the poor to leave much money behind him he kept me at school for three years near london but i was sent home a little before he died because he wished to see me once more and as it was not in mamas power to continue my education a kinsman of hers sent me to be apprentice to mr durant the mercer i am with him upon trial but if my relation that is so rich had thought proper i should have gone to the university and taken my degrees ah i should have been happy to follow my studies and to become one day a great scholar i was always the foremost in my class and my masters were very fond of me the next time that your ladyship shall have occasion for any thing from us i will show you a letter from our head master which i received a week ago you will see by it how fond he was of me ay and he says he will be fond of me as long as he lives   lady abber i do not doubt it my good child you have already made me very fond of you though this is the first time that ever i have seen you but tell me would you be glad to go from behind the counter and return to school   maurice ah if that was possible but my mama cannot do it she has not money enough and schooling is expensive   lady abber yes but if your mother has not there are many people in the world that have more than enough what would you say if i were to send you to a gentleman who should examine you to see if you have made good use of the time that you have spent at school and are likely to make a progress if you should return thither   maurice o madam how happy should i be pray send me to the gentleman directly you shall see what he will say of me and then i may learn what i have not yet had time to know   lady abber do you know the principal academy of this town   maurice oh yes madam i have often sighed as i passed by the door of it   lady abber well stay a moment she sits down before her bureau writes a letter and gives it to maurice there run to the academy and ask for the master you must speak to himself you will give my compliments to him and request him to send a line in answer to my note   maurice but madam i am in a hurry to send these twelve shillings to my mama   lady abber you can wait till tomorrow perhaps you may have still better news to send her   maurice i will first madam carry your letter and then hasten to mr durant who waits for me   lady abber take care not to go astray   maurice oh i shall find my way i wish your ladyship good morning in less than half an hour the master of the academy shall have your letter i will fly to him like a bird   the master of the academy maurice rochester maurice sir i have a note for you from lady  oh dear i have forgot her name but i will run back to her to know it   the master there is no occasion for that child i suppose the ladys name is to the note he opens and looks at the bottom lady abberville oh it is a hand that i know very well reads  sir the child whom i send to you is a poor orphan his father is lately dead and his mother has been under the necessity of taking him from school in order to put him apprentice he seems however to have a strong desire for learning therefore i beg as a favor that you will have the goodness to examine him and if you form any hopes of him i shall charge myself with his education this being my birth day puts me in mind of the duty to which we are born that of doing good to our fellowcreatures and this child seems to have been sent by heaven to be the object of it i request you to give me your opinion of him and am sir etc   take a seat my little man i shall be at your service in a minute i am in haste to finish a letter   maurice oh sir what fine books you have there it is a long time since i have looked into any will you please to let me open one while you write   the master with all my heart my dear   maurice hah this is homer but it is in greek it is too hard for me i never read it but in english   the master what have you read homer and what do you think of him   maurice he is  of fine passages and especially of beautiful  only i with that achille had not been so passionate and stubborn   the master what instances of passion or stubbornness do you find in him   maurice was it well done of him to leave the greeks in distress was it their fault if he quarrelled with agamemnon they had done him no wrong should not he have suffered himself to be persunded when the deputies came to make submission to him in his tent but no he remains immovable as a rock i should not have let them entreat me so long i should have followed them at the first word   the master then you are very goodnatured   maurice we should be so toward all men and especially to our countrymen oh you have a sophocles too the tragedy of philoctetes i believe is by him i have read it in english it is a very moving play but i will tell you sir what i liked best in it   the master i should be glad to know   maurice it is a young grecian  what is this his name is   the master neoptolemus   maurice yes yes neoptolemus it is when hecomes back and brings philoctetes his bow and arrows i think that i should have done the same but i beg pardon sir perhaps my talk grows tiresome to you   the master not at all  listen to you with pleasure besides my letter is finished   maurice then sir i will beg you to tell me what fine book of prints that is that ies open on your esk   the master it is a collection of engravings from the finest paintings in the gallery at florence   maurice that is jupiter i know him   the master how do you like him   maurice i like the picture very well but not mr jupiter   the master why not   maurice because he was an odious character i do not know how the greeks and romans could be such fools as to worship him he was quite a libertine and always quarrelling with juno is that acting like a god   the master you are right he was an improper and contemptible object of worship however nothing has been handed down to us concerning him but the imaginations of the vulgar and you know that the people has always been blind and superstitious   maurice why our peasants nowadays have more sense only imagine sir the clergyman of a parish going into the pulpit and preaching that god almighty has a wife whom he deceives and scolds every day his parishioners would not believe a word of it   the master how comes it that the vulgar are now more sensible than in former times   maurice from the light of the gospel there every thing shows a just and good god if i had lived in greece and had possessed such a book they would never have worshipped any other than the god that we worship   the master kiss me my fine boy what is your name   maurice maurice lavington   the master indeed my dear maurice it would be a pity that you passed your life behind a counter you must apply yourself to learning again   maurice ah i should like that very well if it was in my power   the master i will give you my answer to lady abberville   maurice sir i shall take it with pleasure but she requests you sir i believe to have the kindness to examine me   the master i have done that already i can judge of your understanding and your heart perhaps i may have the pleasure of contributing to procure you a more happy lot amuse yourself in looking over these prints while i write my answer   maurice or rather sir oblige me with a pen and some paper i will write too   the master to your benefactress   maurice no sir to another person   the master may not i know to whom   maurice when my letter is finished sir you shall see it   the master i long to have a view of it they both sit down maurice writes the following letter  dear sir i thank you a thousand times for your kindness in taking notice of me and in writing to lady abberville i should be very happy to return to my former school where every body loves me but since you will be the occasion of my happiness i shall be glad to enjoy it under your eye if i am so lucky as to be admitted into your academy i will love you with all my heart i hope i shall be diligent and well behaved and learn every thing that you will be kind enough to teach me i hardly dare hope that it will be so that depends on the will of providence and yours but if i remain with mr durant you will not refuse me the pleasure of coming to see you now and then and of discoursing a little with you and reading your fine books otherwise i shall soon forget all that i have learned at school and i should be sorry for that although it be not much i hope dear sir you will have the goodness to oblige me and i will let my mama know it to comfort her sorrows for she is very fond of me and i too of her perhaps one day     the master well maurice is your letter finished   maurice no sir not quite i have more to say than you have but there sir read it such as it is   the master how is this why it is addressed to me well this is charming no my good little maurice you shall not remain at mr durants but shall come to me if you like it better you will go now to lady abberville give her this note with my humble respects and let me know what she says of it   maurice o dear shall i be so happy    the master go and heaven befriend you   maurice oh i shall run and be back again directly bowing to the master your servant sir   lady abberville maurice rochester lady abberville well maurice do you bring me an answer   maurice yes madam here it is   lady abber i am curious to know what it says nothing very favorable i am afraid   maurice oh nothing to my prejudice madam i am sure   lady abber  reads to herself  madam you could not give me a more sensible pleasure tha what i felt in the conversation of this amiable child his looks full of ingenuous innocence the lively spirit that appears in his eyes and animates his discourse have warmly attached me to him to shine as a man of letters is more suitable to his genius than to pursue the line to which his fathers death and the poverty of his family had destined him i congratulate you madam that you chose for the object of your generosity a child of so fair hopes heaven seems to have thrown him in your way for that purpose i am strongly persuaded that his behavior and sentiments will never give you cause to repent and shall esteem myself very happy if by my cares i can promote your generous intentions  i have the honor to be etc    lady abber the master seems to be only half satisfied with you   maurice oh madam he is quite satisfied he told me so and i can see it in your eyes   lady abber ay can you see it there my little cunning man but to speak seriously if there was a person that would take the charge of your maintenance and education what would you do for that person   maurice what would i do  i hardly know i can do nothing of myself but i would pray for that person from the bottom of my heart both day and night   lady abber then you shall pray for me my dear child as for your second mother   maurice will you be my mama   lady abber yes i will your father is dead i will fill his place and do ev thing for you that he would you shall go to your learning again and nothing shall be wanting to your education   maurice on dear my good mama i can hardly speak for joy   lady abber if you love me you will never call me any thing but mama remember   maurice oh yes mama i am as happy as a king   lady abber you will lose your little senses come be composed and let us take a walk in the garden i have something to say to you of your mother   mr durant maurice rochester mr durant where have you been so long   maurice oh mr durant if you knew    mr durant knew i know that you should not be so long on an errand do not let this be the case another time what could not you find lady abberville at home   maurice yes sir i found her and i found in her a second mother   mr durant what stuff is this are you mad   maurice no sir but i am going to my learning again i shall be put to an academy in a few days and my mama lady abberville will come tomorrow and speak to you about it   mr durant what do not you choose to stay with me then   maurice why sir i like learning and study better than business   mr durant so then you are only come hither to go away again you have deceived me   maurice no sir i should be very sorry i had not a thought of going and could have staid here contentedly but suppose yourself in my place for a moment if my papa had not died i should not have quitted school to live here a worthy lady acts to me like a parent and offers to put me to school again is it a fault in me to accept her ladyships offer   mr durant well you are only upon trial here it is true and your choice is free you are very right however i wish i had never seen you for i began to be fond of you and now i shall grieve to part with you goes out   maurice mr durant is something blunt but a very worthy man i shall be sorry to leave him and his wife and his children but i must write to mama oh how happy will she be on reading my letter i wish that she had it now in her hands and that i were by her side the next moment he begins to write   dear mama joy joy you are now free from all trouble and i too do not however let tears of joy hinder you from reading my letter this is the story of my happiness mr durant sent me this morning to carry some satin to lady abberville oh an excellent lady ah if you were here now but do you know mama that you are to be here before a week she will give you an apartment in her house and you will live with her and i shall go to school and shall come to see you whenever you choose oh that will be a happiness such a happiness you remember for all that how you cried when i was leaving you you said that you kissed me perhaps for the last time i hope now you will never have that to fear again my mama is to send you money for the journey for she is as much my mama as you are and i am very sure that you will not be angry at that all the money however that you receive in this parcel is not from her there are twelve shillings from me she gave them to me and i send them to you make haste to get every thing in readiness for your journey hither the sooner you come the happier we shall be i have spoken so well of you to the lady that she wishes to see you almost as much as i do set out set out i shall watch the coming of every stage to tell you the whole story before you see her though i suppose she tells it to you herself in the letter that she writes to you today i have not time to add more for i should be afraid that my letter would be too late if i wrote all that i have to say  i am dear mama etc   madam how shall i find words to express to you my joy and gratitude gracious heaven my misfortunes are then at an end i am happy and my child also and to you we owe that we are so how shall i be able to bear so sudden an elevation from a gulf of misery to the summit of joy i have only tears to express what i feel and i am sorry that i cannot give you even this testimony of my gratitude personally at this moment you have wished to be a mother therefore you may perhaps form an idea of my happiness as for me i want words to express it and i shall want them perhaps still more when i for the first time see my son placed between us both and our arms intermingled in embracing him but you will understand my silence which the ardor and sincerity of my attachment to you shall perfectly explain every moment of my life  i have the honor to be etc oxford  the parricide what dreadful weather i perish with cold and have no shelter against the bitter winds no bed to warm my benumbed limbs i am old and my strength is exhausted by labor unnatural son the thought of you tears my heart unnatural son i gave you life i nourished you and took care of your weak and sickly infancy when i saw you suffer through illness my tears fell upon your cheeks you loved me at that time and would say while you caressed me papa what makes you cry i am not sick now do not be troubled see i am quite well you raised yourself up in your bed your little hands would play in my hair and you would say again do not grieve any more i am cured and as you spoke the words you would fall down again through weakness you would strive to speak but could not at last however your body grew strong you became hale and robust and you should have been the prop of my old age i labored all my life for you and now you shut me out of your house in the midst of wind and snow we cannot live together any longer father said you to me in your fury and why not my son what have i done to you i have exhorted you to virtue that is all my crime when i saw you spend in debauchery the earnings of sixty years labor the fortune of which i willingly stripped myself to enrich you i pointed out your danger to you god is my witness that i was more anxious on your account than on my own was i not silent long enough for fear of troubling you but my silence and my sorrow which i strove to hide made no impression on you i was then obliged to speak i thought it my duty then to resume the prerogative of a father yet my authority was tempered with mildness my discourse was as tender as it was earnest i spoke to you of your mother who died through grief on account of your disorderly life i spoke to you of myself whom the same cause would probably send to my grave i showed you my aged cheeks almost worn with the tears that you have made me shed i showed you my gray hairs which stood on end through anguish and sorrow i opened my arms to you to invite you to my bosom i should have fallen on my knees to you if your father even in that humble posture could have softened you and you my son  i can scarcely believe it yet  you advanced toward me with a threatening air your arm was stretched out and your gate shut against me you my son you are no longer so why do my bowels still feel the yearnings of a father toward you i am tempted to wish that i could curse you but no i dare not breathe forth even my complaints aloud i fear left heaven should hear them and left this house which you have shut against me should fall upon your door i will lay myself down on the stone before your door tomorrow you cannot come out without seeing me and i hardly think that your heart will not soften when you see what i shall have suffered during this dreadful night but if the severity of the season if my exhausted old age and still more the sorrows that wound my heart should occasion my death then shudder at thy crime weep for me and for yourself still more ah i should think my death a fortunate circumstance if it could produce your reformation  such were the complaints of this old man but the north wind all the livelong night carried away his sighs unheard the tempest filled the air with dreadful whistlings the shattered trees of the forest were bent down and all nature seemed to shudder with horror at the crime of his son the next morning the old man was found dead upon the stone he had hishands clasped together and his face turned toward heaven the name of his son was the last word that he had pronounced he had prayed to the very last moment for the parricide  jonathan jonathan a gardener of lincoln was looked upon as the most skilful in the county his fruits surpassed those of his neighbors in bigness and were always found to have an exquisite flavor all the first gentlemen round about were ambitious of having his peaches at their deserts so that he had no occasion to send his melons to the market they were bespoke on the beds and very often could not be had for gold the reputation that he obtained and the profits that he drew from his labors increased his assiduity in the cultivation of his garden rich and industrious as he was he easily found a proper match and espoused claribell a young woman in the neighborhood as prudent as she was handsome the first year of their marriage was very happy claribell assisted her husband in his labors and the fruits of their garden were more prosperous than ever  unhappily for jonathan near his house there lived another gardener called guzzle who at day break fixed himself in an alehouse which he seldom left before night jonathan was delighted with guzzles hearty humor and was not long before he fell into the same taste at first he went now and then to meet him at the alehouse and only talked to him of gardening but very soon in his own garden he talked to him of nothing but strong beer claribell grieved at the change in her husbands behavior as she had not as yet sufficiedt experience herself to undertake the care of the walltrees she was frequently obliged to bring him home to his work and usually found him amongst his pots and glasses alas it would often have been better for him to stay from the garden his head was now generally muddled with beer when he went to work upon his trees and his pruningknife cut away at random amongst the branches those that bore were cut as well as those that did not and the fine peach trees on which last year there had not been single bough unfruitful did now only stretch their lazy arms like so many yawning idlers the more jonathan found his garden decay the more fond he grew of this sottish way of life his fruit and his vegetables had lost their great name and not being able by his earnings to satisfy his fondness for drink he parted by degrees with his furniture his linen and his clothes at length one day when his wife was gone to market with some roots that she had reared herself he went and sold all his garden utensils in order to drink the money with guzzle it would be difficult to describe claribells grief at her return to be reduced from a moderate competency to the most destitute poverty was not the height of her misfortune she felt still more strongly for the fate of her husband and of a young infant six months old which she had then at the breast who should suppose that this child was to save the whole family from destruction  the evening of the same day jonathan came home swearing threw himself into a chair and leaning on his elbow over the table surlily asked his wife for something to eat claribell handed him a large caseknife and a basket that was covered with her apron jonathan snatched the apron off but what was his surprise to see his own child fast asleep in the basket eat there said claribell to him it is all that i have left to give you you are the father of this child and if you do not devour him famine and misery shortly will jonathan thunderstruck at these words remained speechless with his eyes stupidly fixed upon his son at length his sorrow broke out in tears and exclamations he rises and embracing his wife asks her pardon and promises to reform and he kept his word  his father in law who for some time had refused to see him being informed of his good intentions advanced him a sum to enable him to put his garden in order again jonathan made good use of this supply and very soon his garden flourished as happily as ever he became once more and continued even to his old age active industrious a good husband and a good father he took pleasure sometimes though he blushed at the same time in telling this story to his son who from his example conceived such an aversion to drinking and idleness that he was all his life as sober as he was laborious  vanity punished a drama in one act characters mr waller mrs waller valentine their son mr ray friends to mr waller mr nash friends to mr waller michael a country boy martin the gardener scene i a garden mr waller mrs waller mr w yonder is our valentine walking in the garden with a book in his hand i am very much afraid that it is rather through vanity than from a real desire of improving himself that he always appears to be busy reading   mrs w what makes you think so my dear   mr w do not you remark that he casts a sidelook now and then to see if any body takes notice of him   mrs w and yet his masters give a very flattering account of his diligence and all agree that he is very far advanced for his age   mr w that is true but if my suspicions are right and if the little that he can know has made him vain i would rather a hundred times that he knew nothing and were modest   mrs w that he knew nothing   mr w yes my dear a man without any great extent of knowledge but upright modest and industrious is a much more estimable member of society than a learned man whose studies have turned his head and puffed up his heart   mrs w i cannot think that my son is of that description   mr w heaven forbid but while we are here in the country i shall have more opportunities of observing him and i am resolved to take advantage of the first that shall offer to clear up my doubts i see him coming toward us leave me alone with him a moment   scene ii mr waller valentine val to michael whom he pushes back no leave me papa it is that little fool of a country boy that comes always to interrupt me in my reading   mr w why do you call that goodnatured child a little fool   val why he knows nothing   mr w of what you have learnt i grant you but then he knows many things which you do not and you may both inform each other a good deal if you will communicate what you know one to the other   val he may learn a good deal of me but what can i learn from him   mr w if ever you should have a farm do you think that it would be of no service to you to have an early notion of the labors of the country to learn to distinguish trees and plants to know the times of sowing and harvest and to study the wonders of vegetation michael possesses these different parts of knowledge and desires no better than to share them with you they will perhaps be one day of the greatest use to you those on the contrary that you could communicate would be of no service to him so that you see in this intercourse all the advantage is on your side   val well but papa would it become me to learn any thing from a little country boy   mr w why not if he is capable of instructing you i know no real distinction amongst men than that of useful talents and good manners and you must own that in both these points he has equally the advantage over you   val what in good manners too   mr w in every station they consist in treating all persons as our duty prescribes to us he does so in showing a particular attachment and complaisance to you do you do the same do you make a return of mildness and good will and yet he seems to merit them he is active and intelligent i believe him to be possessed of goodnature spirit and good sense you ought to think yourself very happy in having so amiable a companion with whom you may at once amuse and improve yourself his father is my fosterbrother and has always had a remarkable affection for me i am pretty sure that michael has the same for you see how the poor little fellow hankers about the terracewalk to meet you take care and use him with civility there is more honor and integrity in his fathers cottage than in many palaces his family too has been our tenants for some generations and i should be glad to see the connection continued between our children he goes out   scene iii valentine alone yes a fine connection indeed i think papa is joking this little country boy teach me any thing no i will surprise him now so much with my learning that he will not think of talking to me of his own i will warrant him  scene iv valentine michael mich you will not have my little nosegay then master valentine   val nosegay pshaw neither ranunculus nor tulip   mich why it is true they are only field flowers but they are pretty and i thought you might like to know them by their names   val a great matter indeed to know the names of your herbs you may carry them where you found them   mich well now if i had known that i would not have taken the trouble to gather them i was resolved not to go home yesterday evening without bringing you something and as i came back from work though it was rather late and i had a great mind for my supper i stopped in our close to gather them by the light of the moon   val you talk of the moon do you know how big it is   mich heh fegs as big as a cheese   val ignorant little clown struts with an air of importance while michael stands staring at him look here showing him his book this is telemaque have you ever read it   mich that is not in the catechism our schoolmaster never talked to me about that   val no it is none of your country books   mich nay how should i have read it then but let us see it   val do not think of touching it with your dirty hands holding one of them up where did you buy these tanned leather gloves   mich anan it is my hand master valentine   val the skin is so hard that one might cut it into shoe soles   mich it is not with idleness that they are grown so hard you know how to talk very well i dare say and yet i would not change conditions with you to work honestly and offend nobody is all that i know and it would be no harm if you knew as much good bye sir   scene v valentine alone i think the little clown had a mind to make game of me but i see company coming on the terracewalk i must put on a studious air before them he sits down seeming to read in his book with great attention  scene vi mr and mrs waller mr ray mr nash valentine seated on a bench on one side mr wall what a fine evening would you choose gentlemen to take a walk up this slope to see the sun setting   mr ray i was going to mention it the weather is delicious and the sky perfectly without a cloud in the west   mr nash i shall be sorry to go far from the nightingale do you hear his charming melody madam   mrs wall i was taken up with thinking my heart was filled with pleasure   mr ray how can one live in town during this charming weather   mr wall valentine will you walk up the slope with us to see the sun setting   val no i thank you papa i am reading something here that gives me more pleasure   mr wall if you speak truth i pity you and if you do not  come gentlemen there is not a moment to lose let us continue our walk they walk forward up the hill   scene vii valentine seeing them at a good distance there they are almost out of sight i need not be under any constraint now puts the book into his pocket what an opinion will these gentlemen have of my diligence i should like to be a bird and fly after them to hear the praises that they are giving me saunters about yawning and listless for near a quarter of an hour i am tired after all of being here alone i can do better the sun is set now and i hear the company returning i will slip into the wood and hide myself in it so that they shall scarcely find me mama will send all the servants to look for me with lights they will talk of nothing but me all the evening and will compare me with those great philosophers that have been known to go astray in their learned meditations and to lose themselves in woods my adventure will make a fine noise now for it he goes into the wood   scene viii mr and mrs waller mr ray mr nash mr ray i never saw weather more pleasing nor a more charming scene   mr wall gentlemen my pleasure has been doubled by my enjoying it in your company   mr nash the nightingale too still continues his song his voice seems even to grow more tender as night comes on i am sorry that mrs waller does not seem to listen to it with as much pleasure as before   mrs w it is because i am anxious about my son i do not see him in the garden she calls him valentine he does not answer perceiving the gardener she calls him martin have you seen my son   martin yes madam about ten minutes ago i saw him turn toward the grove   mrs w toward the grove bless me if he should lose himself pray run after him and bring him in   martin yes madam goes out   mrs w mr waller will not you go along with him   mr w no my dear i am not uneasy for my part martin will be able to find him   mrs w but if he should take a different way i am frightened out of my wits   mr nash make yourself easy madam mr ray and i will take the two sides of the wood while the gardener shall take the middle we cannot fail of finding him so   mrs w ah gentlemen i did not dare to ask it of you but you know the feelings of a mother   mr w gentlemen do not give yourselves so much trouble i would rather you would not   mr ray you will not take it amiss that we comply with mrs wallers request rather than yours   mr w i must confess it is against my inclination   mr nash we will receive your reproaches at our return  they walk toward the grove scene ix mr and mrs waller mrs w why my dear whence comes this indifference about your son   mr w do you think my dear that i love him less than you do no but i know better how to love him   mrs w and what if he could not be found   mr w i should be very glad of it   mrs w what that he should pass the night in a gloomy wood what would become of the poor child and what would become of me   mr w you would both be cured he of his vanity and you of your injudicious fondness which keeps it up in him   mrs w what do you mean my dear   mr w i am just now convinced of what i only suspected in the morning the boys head is filled with excessive vanity and all his reading is but ostentation he has only lost himself on purpose to make us look for him and to appear absent and forgetful through intense study it gives me more pain that his mind should wander from a right way of thinking than if his steps really went astray he will be unhappy all his life if he is not cured of it in time and there is nothing but a wholesome humiliation that can save him   mrs w but do you consider    mr w yes everything he is eleven years old if he can profit any thing by his natural sense or his learning the light of the moon and the direction of the wind may guide him sufficiently to clear the wood   mrs w but if he has not that thought   mr w he will then better see the necessity of profiting by the lessons that i have given him upon this subject besides we intend him for the army and in that profession he will have many nights to pass without shelter he will know now what it is and not go to a camp quite raw to be laughed at by his companions then the air is not very cold at this season of the year and for one night he will not die with hunger since by his folly he has brought himself into a scrape let him get out of it again or suffer the disagreeable consequences of it   mrs w no i cannot agree to it and if you dont send people after him i will go myself   mr w well my dear i will make you easy though i am sorry that you will not let me follow my plan as i intended i shall tell little michael to join him as it were by chance colin too shall be at a small distance in order to run to them in case of an accident for any thing more do not ask it i have taken my resolution and do not choose by a blind weakness to deprive my son of a lesson that may be of service to him here are our friends coming back with martin   mrs w o heavens i see and they have not found him   mr w i am glad of it   scene x mr and mrs waller mr ray and mr nash mr nash our search has been in vain but if mr waller will let us have some lights and servants    mr w no gentlemen you have complied with my wifes request you will now listen to mine i am a father and know my duty as one let us go into the parlour and i will give you an account of my design   scene xi the middle of the wood valentine what have i done fool that i was it is dark night and i dont know which way to turn calls papa papa nobody answers i am undone what will become of me cries o mama where are you answer your son this once heavens what is that running through the wood if it should be a robber help help   scene xii valentine michael michael who is there who is it that cries so what is it you sir how do you happen to be here at this time of night   valentine o dear michael my dear friend i have lost my way   mich looking at him first with an air of surprise and then bursting out in a laugh you dont say so i your dear michael your dear friend you mistake i am only a dirty little country boy dont you remember nay let go my hand the skin is only fit to cut up for shoe soles   val my dear friend excuse my impertinence and for pitys sake guide me back to our house my mama will pay you well   mich looking at him from top to bottom have you finished reading your tellymack   val looking down quite confused ah pray now    mich putting his finger to the side of his nose and looking up tell me my little wise man how big may the moon be just now   val nay spare me i beg of you and guide me out of this wood   mich you see then master that one may be a dirty little country boy and yet be good for something what would you give now to know your way instead of knowing how big the moon is   val i own my fault and i promise never to show any pride for the future   mich well that is clever but this same repenting by necessity may only hang by a thread it is not amiss that a young gentleman should see what it is to look upon a poor mans son like a dog and play with him according to his fancy but to show you that an honest clown does not bear malice i will pass the night with you as i have passed many a one with our sheep on the downs tomorrow morning early i will take you home to your papa here then i will share my bedchamber with you   val o my good michael   mich stretching himself under a tree come sir settle yourself at your ease   val but where is this bedchamber of yours   mich why here striking on the ground here is my bed take your place it is wide enough for us both   val what must we lie here under the open air   mich i assure you sir the king himself has not a better bed see what a fine cieling you have over your head how many bright diamonds adorn it and then our handsome silver lamp pointing to the moon well what do you think of it   val oh my dear michael i am ready to die with hunger   mich i dare say i can help you there too see here are some potatoes dress them as you know how   val why they are raw   mich it is only to boil or roast them make a fire   val we want a light to kindle one and then where shall we find coal or wood   mich smiling why cannot you find all that in your books   val oh no my dear michael   mich well then i will show you that i know more than you and all your tellymacks takes a tinder box with flint and steel out of his pocket crack there is fire already now you shall see he gathers a handful of dry leaves and putting them round the under sons with his hand until they take fire we shall soon have a blazing hearth he puts bits of dry wood upon the lighted leaves do you see lays the potatees close to the fire and sprinkles them with dust this must serve instead of ashes to hinder them from burning having laid them properly and covered them once more with dust he turns the fire over them then adds fresh wood and blows it up with his breath have you a finer fire in your papas kitchen come now they will soon be done   val o my good friend what return can i make to your kindness   mich return pooh when one does good it pays itself but stop a moment while the potatoes are roasting i will fetch some hay for you i saw a good deal lying in one part of the wood you will sleep upon that like a prince but take care of the roast while i am away goes out singing   scene xiii valentine fool that i was how could i be so unjust as to despise this child what am i compared to him how little i am in my own eyes when i examine his behavior and mine but it shall never happen again henceforward i will not despise those of a lower condition than myself i will not be so proud nor so vain he walks about and gathers up dry sticks for the fire   scene xiv valentine michael hauling in a large bundle of hay mich here is your bed of down your coverlid and all i will make you a head now quite soft   val i thank you my friend i would help you but i do not know how to set about it   mich i dont want you i can do it all alone go warm yourself he unties the bundle spreads part of it on the ground and reserves the rest for a covering that is finished now let us think of supper takes a potatoe from the fire and tastes it they are done eat them while they are warm they are better so   val what will not you eat some with me   mich no thank you there is just enough for you   val how do you

never tasted sweeter at your papas table   val that is very true   mich are you done come then your bed is ready for you valentine lies down michael spreads the rest of the hay over him then takes off his jacket the nights are cold here cover yourself with this too if you find yourself chilly come to the fire i will take care that it does not go out good night   val dear michael i shall never be easy until i make you amends for my treating you ill   mich think no more of it i do not the lark will awake us tomorrow morning at break of day valentine falls asleep and michael sits up close by him to keep the fire in at break of day michael awakes him come master you have slept enough the lark has opened her song already and the sun will soon appear behind the hill let us set out and go to your papas   val rubbing his eyes what already so soon good morning my dear michael   mich good morning master valentine how did you sleep   val rising as sound as a rock here is your jacket i thank you a thousand thousand times i shall never forget you as long as i live   mich do not talk of thanks i am as happy as you come walk along with me i will guide you they go off   scene xv a room in mr wallers house mr and mrs waller mrs w in what terrors have i passed this whole night i fear my dear that some accident has happened to him we must send out people to look for him   mr w make yourself easy my love i will go myself but who knocks the door opens look here he is   scene xvi mr and mrs waller valentine michael mrs w running to her son ah do i see thee again my dear child   mich yes madam there he is ifegs a little better mayhap than before you lost him   mr w is that the case   val yes papa i have been well punished for my pride what will you give him that has reformed me   mr w a good reward and with the greatest cheerfulness   val presenting michael to him well this is he to whom you owe it i owe him my friendship too and he shall always share it   mr w if that is so i will make him a little present every year of a couple of guineas for curing you of so intolerable a fault   mrs w and i will make him one of the same sum for having preserved my son to me   mich if you pay me for the satisfaction that you feel i should pay you too for what i felt so we are clear   mr w no my little man we shall not run from our words but let us go to breakfast all four valentine shall relate his adventures of the night   val yes papa and i shall not spare myself though i should be turned into ridicule for them i blush for my folly but hope that i shall never have to blush for the same behavior again   mr w my dear son how happy you will make your mother and me by proving that your reformation is sincere and will never suffer a relapse   valentine takes michael by the hand mr waller gives his to his lady and they all go into the next apartment the pleasures of work lady stanfield what is the matter viola you seem grieved   viola so i am mama   lady stan at what my dear i thought to see you come back quite in spirits after your walk   viola my walk was pleasant at first but in coming home as i passed before our carpenters house i saw his three children sitting at the door and crying most piteously they were starving with hunger   lady stan how can that be their father has a good trade and it is not a week since i paid him three guineas for work done about our house   viola so my governess told a woman one of the neighbors that came up to comfort the children and gave them some bread   lady stan and what did she say   viola this poor man said she is much to be pitied he works night and day and is never the richer his wife manages so ill she knows nothing of housewifery she can neither sew nor spin nor knit and cannot even get up the familys linen if her husband wants a clean shirt he must have it washed and mended out of the house   lady stan sad management indeed and i do not wonder that you were grieved at finding a woman who does not perform any single duty of her sex i wish she may be the only one of that sort that you will ever meet   viola ah mama this is not all as she can do nothing for her family nothing in the world idleness has led her to drinking when her husband after working hard thinks to have a good meal ready for him at his return home he finds his wife stretched upon the bed intoxicated and very often his children have not a bit of bread to eat the whole day dont you think those poor children much to be pitied   lady stan i pity them as well as you my dear but on this disagreeable occasion you had an opportunity of making a remark that may be serviceable to you all your life   viola what is that mama   lady stan that a woman who neglects the employments of her sex and condition is the most contemptible and unhappy creature in the world you may now perceive the reason why your papa and i constantly advise you to be doing something   viola oh yes mama i see now how much you love me when you instruct me in my work but pray tell me have young ladies of fortune and quality any occasion to learn so many things when they are married have not they waiting women to do for them whatever they want   lady stan my dear viola work is as absolutely necessary for them as for the children of the poor not to mention the reverses of fortune that may one day deprive a woman of every means of subsistence except the labor of her own hands and yet these reverses are common enough but in the highest rank of life amidst a crowd of servants ready at her call should not she herself know something of what work is in order to employ each one properly in his several way not to require of them more than they can perform to be able to recompense their diligence by making their service easy and thus to gain their attachment and respect obliged by her rank and her wealth to employ a great number of tradesmen how will she be able without knowing what work is herself to set the proper value upon that of others by neither cutting short the fair demand of a useful tradesman nor yielding to the impositions of the vender of luxuries and fashionable toys and thus on the one hand indulge a generosity suitable to her birth and on the other guard against a useless expence besides what a pleasure for a sensible woman to see herself and her children clothed in the work of her own hands and to employ the savings of such economy in relieving the sick and indigent and bringing up their children so that they may in proper time maintain their parents   viola ah pray dont let us lose a moment teach me all that mama   lady stan i will my dear that i may by so doing both perform my own duty and assist you to follow the dictates of nature and religion but particularly that i may save you from that dangerous dissipation which a habit of idleness may render agreeable and even necessary i will do it in order to make domestic retirement not unpleasing to you in order to make you yourself amiable in the eyes of your husband and respectable in those of your children in order to procure you hereafter a relief and amusement that may divert your attention from the evils of life which might otherwise affect you too forcibly and in fine to insure to you the tranquillity of a good conscience and to render you happy every moment of your life you have seen by the example of the carpenters wife to what odious vices idleness may lead us but what think you of that vapourish unhappy listlessness the most insupportable torment to a woman i can give you perhaps a slight idea of it and proportioned to your understanding in the story of a little girl of your own age   viola o dear mama make haste let us have the little girls story   lady stan then here it is mrs friendly was always happy in being employed and never passed a quarter of an hour otherwise the whole day angelica her daughter could hardly believe her when she talked to her of the satisfaction arising from industry and the disagreeable effects of doing nothing it is true she worked whenever her mother bid her for she was accustomed to obey but one may easily imagine how unhappy she was at her work as she never began it but with reluctance my dear child mrs friendly would often say to her when she saw her at work with her head hanging down and her hands in a careless posture i wish you may soon feel the tiresome languor that arises from having nothing to do and the satisfaction that one enjoys in being moderately employed this wish inspired by her affection was not long unaccomplished angelica then about eleven years old was to go one day with her mother to a country house many miles off mrs friendly at her departure took her workbag with her and strongly recommended it to angelica not to forget hers angelica was willing to obey but how easily does one lose sight of a duty that is performed with reluctance the workbag was forgot their journey at first was quite agreeable the weather was fine and all nature seemed to smile but about noon the clouds thickened round the horizon and the thunder rolled from one end of the sky to the other their fright obliged them to stop at a small town where there was only one inn and immediately afterward the rain came down in a flood as the approaching storm had forced a number of travelers to seek shelter in the inn mrs friendly and her daughter could not find a single room in it disengaged she therefore ordered the horses to be unharnessed and alighted at the house of a good old woman close by who very civilly resigned them her bedchamber and her bed the only one that she had how happy was mrs friendly that she had brought her work the good old woman sat beside her spinning at her wheel and between work and conversation the long summers afternoon passed away without seeming tedious to them poor angelica was not very happy in the mean time the cottage was small and after she had visited every corner of it she had then absolutely nothing left to do the rain which still fell in great abundance did not allow her to set her foot out of doors the terrible noise of the thunder left her no desire for sleep and the conversation of the old woman who could talk of nothing but her work was not very likely to amuse her she begged her mama to let her have her work but mrs friendly told her very justly that she would not deprive herself of amusement for her that having taken care to bring with her something to employ herself it was but fair that she should enjoy the fruits of her attention and that she on the contrary should suffer for her negligence and forgetfulness angelica could say nothing to reasons so forcible after many wearisome yawnings sighs of impatience and fruitless murmurs against the weather angelica at length got to the end of the evening she eat a small supper without appetite and went to bed much out of humor with her jaunt how joyful did she rise at the first summons of the sun who rose without a cloud with what eagerness did she hasten her mothers departure at last the carriage was ready and mrs friendly having generously rewarded the good old woman for her civility set forward again as well satisfied with her manner of passing the day before as angelica was discontented with it the roads had lately been much broken up and the rain water which still covered them hindered the ruts from being observed the chaise jolted out of one hole into another the axle creaked and the glasses rattled at last a wheel broke down and the carriage was overthrown happily mrs friendly and her daughter received no hurt they recovered from their fright by degrees and perceiving at a distance a little hamlet upon the side of a hill mrs friendly took her daughter by the hand and attended by her servant walked toward the hamlet intending to send assistance to her coachman there was in this place neither smith nor wheelwright so that they were obliged to wait almost two days for wheels from town as mrs friendly would travel in no other carriage but her own poor angelica how she cried how she lamented the tediousness of the time the fright of her fall had made such an impression on her as to deprive her of the use of her limbs so that she could not enjoy even the amusement of walking what could mrs friendly do to make her time less heavy the strict justice that she made a point of pursuing with her daughter forbad her to resign her own work to her besides angelica had so neglected her improvement in needle work that she ould have entirely spoiled it she then began to feel the value of employing ones self and blushing with shame said thus to her mother ah mama i have well deserved what has happened to me and now for the first time see the reason why you always advised me so strongly to work i have sufficiently felt the wearisomeness of doing nothing she then threw herself into her mothers arms and hiding her face in her bosom i beg pardon mama for grieving you by my indolence i saw that you were troubled to see me fret but for your sake and my own i shall change my behavior from this moment mrs friendly kissed her daughter praised her resolution and to strengthen the effect of angelicas selftaught lesson showed her how a taste for work hinders our time from hanging heavy and softens the vexations of life by diverting our thoughts from them in an agreeable and salatary manner she blessed the accidents of a journey that had wrought so happy a change in her daughter  angelica on the other hand kept her promise and even went beyond it so that mrs friendly never had reason to find fault with her afterward unless for too great application   the young sparrows little robert one day perceived a sparrows nest under the eaves of the house and running immediately for his sisters to inform them of his discovery they all contrived together how to get the little covey into their possession it was agreed to wait until the young ones should be fledged that then robert should raise a ladder against the wall and that his sister should hold it fast below while he climbed up for the nest when they thought the little birds sufficiently feathered they made ready to put their design in execution it succeeded perfectly and they found three young ones in the nest the old birds sent forth piteous cries on seeing their little ones whom they had nourished with so much care taken from them but robert and his sisters were so overjoyed that they did not pay the least attention to their complaints  they were at first something puzzled what to do with their prisoners augusta the youngest being of a mild and compassionate disposition was for having them put into a cage she promised to take the charge of them upon herself and to feed them regularly every day she described in a lively manner to her brother and sister the pleasure that they should have in seeing and hearing those young birds when grown big this was opposed by robert he maintained that it was better to pluck them just as they were and that it would be much more funny to look at them jumping about in the room without feathers than to see them dismally shut up in a cage charlotte the eldest declared herself of the same opinion as augusta but robert persisted in his own  at last the two little girls seeing that their brother would not give up the point and that besides he had the nest in his possession agreed to whatever he desired but he had not waited for their consent to begin his execution the first was already plucked there is one stripped says he setting it on the ground in a moment all the little family were deprived of their tender feathers the poor things cried peep peep and complained very piteously they shuddered with the cold and shook their bare little wings but robert instead of pitying their sufferings did not end his persecutions there he pushed them with his toe to make them go on and whenever they tumbled over the burst out a laughing and at last his sisters joined in the laugh with him  while they were indulging this cruel amusement they saw at a distance their tutor coming toward them mum each pocketed a bird and was slinking off well cried their tutor to them where are you going come hither this order obliged them to stop they advanced slowly with their eyes fixed on the ground  the tutor why do you run away at my coming   rob we were only playing   the tutor you know i do not debar you of amusement and indeed i am never so happy as when i see you all merry   rob we were afraid that you were coming to scold us   the tutor do i ever scold you for taking an innocent diversion i see you have done something amiss why have you each your hand in your pocket i must know the reason show me each your hand and what you have in it they show each their hand with a bird plucked   the tutor with an emotion of pity and indignation and who could give you the idea of treating these poor little creatures thus   rob why it is so droll to see sparrows jump without feathers   the tutor you think it very droll to see innocent creatures suffer and to hear their cries when in pain   rob no sir i did not think it put them to pain   the tutor did not you come hither i will convince you it did he plucks a few hairs out of roberts head   rob oh oh   the tutor does that hurt you   rob do you think it does not to pluck ones hairs   the tutor pshaw there are only a dozen   rob but that is too much   the tutor what would it be then were one to pluck out all your hair so have you a notion of the pain that you would feel and yet you have put these birds to the very same torture though they never did you any harm and you young ladies you that should be more tenderhearted did you suffer this   the two little misses were standing by silent but hearing these last words and feeling the keenness of the rebuke they sat down with their eyes swimming in tears the tutor remarking their sorrow was touched with it and said no more to them  robert did not cry and endeavored to justify himself thus i could not think that i did them any harm they sung all the while and they clapped their wings as if they were pleased   the tutor do you call their cries singing but why should they sing   rob i suppose to call their father and mother   the tutor no doubt and when their cries should have brought them what did the young ones mean to tell them by clapping their wings   rob i cannot say exactly perhaps to ask their help   the tutor just so therefore if those birds could have expressed themselves in our speech you would have heard them cry ah father and mother save us we have unhappily fallen into the hands of cruel children who have plucked all our feathers we are cold and in pain come warm us and cure us or we shall die  the little girls could hold out no longer they sobbed and hid their faces in their handkerchiefs it was you robert that led us to this cruelty we hated the thought of it ourselves robert was then himself sensible of his fault he had already been punished by his tutor plucking his hair he was now much more so by the reproaches of his own heart the tutor thought there was no occasion to add to this double punishment it was not indeed from an instinct of cruelty but purely from want of thought that robert had done this illnatured action and the pity which he selt from that moment for all creatures weaker than himself opened his heart to the sentiments of kindness and humanity that have animated him all the rest of his life   the two apple trees arich husbandman had two sons the one exactly a year older than the other the very day the second was born he had set in the entrance of his orchard two young apple trees equal in size which he had since cultivated with the same care and which had thriven so equally that nobody could give the preference to either of them before the other when his children were capable of handling garden tools he took them one fine spring day to see those two trees which he had planted for them and called by their names and after they had sufficiently admired their fine growth and the number of blossoms that covered them he said you see children i give you these trees in good condition they will thrive as much by your care as they will lose by your negligence and their fruit will reward you in proportion to your labor  the youngest named edmund was indefatigable in his attention he was all day busy in clearing his tree of insects that would have hurt it and he propped up its stem to hinder it from taking an ugly bent he loosened the earth all round it that the warmth of the sun and the moisture of the dews might cherish its roots his mother had not tended him more carefully in his infancy than he did his young apple tree  his brother moses did none of all this he spent his time on a mount that was hard by throwing stones from it at passengers in the road he went amongst all the little country boys in the neighborhood to box with them so that he was always seen with broken shins and black eyes from the blows and kicks that he received in his quarrels he neglected his tree so far in short that he never once thought of it till one day in autumn he by chance saw edmunds tree so full of apples streaked with purple and gold that were it not for the props which supported its branches the weight of its fruit must have bent it to the ground struck with the fight of so fine a growth he ran to his own hoping to find as large a crop on it but what was his surprise when he saw nothing but branches covered with moss and a few yellow leaves quite angry and jealous he went to his father and said father what sort of a tree is this that you have given me it is as dry as a broomstick and i shall not have ten apples on it but my brother  oh you have used him better bid him at least share his apples with me  share with you said his father so the industrious would lose his laber to feed the idle take what you get it is the reward of your negligence and do not think to accuse me of injustice when you see your brothers rich crop your tree was as fruitful and in as good order as his it bore as many blossoms and grew in the same soil only it had not the same usage edmund has kept his tree clear of even the smallest infects you have suffered them to eat up yours in its blossom as i do not choose to let any thing which god has given me and for which i hold myself accountable to him go to ruin i take this tree from you again and call it no more by your name it must pass through his hands to recover itself and is his property from this moment as well as the fruit that he shall make it bear you may go and look for another in my nursery and rear it if you will to make amends for your fault but if you neglect it that too shall belong to your brother for assisting me in my labor  moses felt the justice of his fathers sentence and the wisdom of his design he went that moment and chose in the nursery the most thriving young apple tree that he could find edmund assisten him with his advice in rearing it and moses did not lose a moment he was never out of humor now with his comrades and still less with himself for he applied cheerfully to work and in autumn he saw his tree fully answer his hopes thus he had the double advantage of enriching himself with a plentiful growth of fruit and at the same time of getting rid of the vicious habits that he had contracted  his father was so well pleased with this change that the following year he shared the produce of a small orchard between him and his brother  if men do not see you god sees you mr ferguson was walking in the country one fine warm day in harvest time with his youngest son frank papa said frank looking wistfully toward a garden by the side of which they were walking i am very dry  and i too my dear answered mr ferguson but we must have patience until we go home  frank there is a pear tree loaded with very fine fruit they are windsor pears ah with what pleasure i could eat one   mr ferg i do not doubt it but that tree is in a private garden   frank the hedge is not very thick and here is a hole where i can easily get through   mr ferg and what would the owner of the garden say if he should be there   frank oh he is not there i dare say and nobody can see us   mr ferg you mistake child there is one who sees us and who would punish us and justly too because it would be wicked to do what you propose   frank who is that papa   mr ferg he who is every where present who never loses sight of us a moment and who sees to the very bottom of our thoughts that is god   frank ah it is very true i shall not think of it any more  just then a man stood up behind the hedge whom they could not see before because he had been sitting down on a grassy slope it was an old man the owner of the garden who spoke thus to frank return thanks to god my child that your father hindered you from stealing into my garden and coming to take what does not belong to you know that at the foot of each tree there is a trap laid to catch thieves where you would certainly have been caught and perhaps have lamed yourself for ever but since at the first word of the prudent lesson given you by your father you have showed a fear of god and did no longer insist on the theft that you intended i will give you with pleasure some of the fruit that you wished to taste at these words he went up to the finest pear tree shook it and brought back his hat full of pears to frank  mr ferguson would have taken money out of this purse to pay this civil old man but could not prevail on him to accept any i have had a satisfaction sir in obliging your son which i should lose were i to be paid for it god alone repays such actions  mr ferguson shook hands with him over the hedge and frank thanked him too in a very manly manner but he showed a still more lively gratitude in the hearty appetite that he appeared to have for the pears which did indeed quite run over with juice that is a very good man said frank to his papa after he had finished the last and they had got a good distance from the old man   mr ferg yes my dear and he is so no doubt because his heart is convinced of this great truth that god never fails to reward good actions and chastise evil   frank would god have punished me then if i had taken the pears   mr ferg the good old man told you what would have happened to you god my dear child orders every thing that passes upon earth and directs events so as to reward good people for their virtuous actions and to punish the wicked for their crimes i will tell you an adventure which relates to this subject and made so strong an impression on me when a child that i shall never forget it as long as i live   frank ah papa how happy i am today a pleasant walk fine pears and a story besides   mr ferg when i was as little as you and lived at my fathers we had two neighbors the one on the right the other on the left hand of our house their names were dobson and vicars mr dobson had a son called simon and mr vicars one also of the name of gamaliel behind our house and those of our neighbors were small gardens separated at that time only by quickset hedges simon when alone in his fathers garden amused himself with throwing stones into all the gardens round about never once thinking that he might hurt somebody mr dobson had observed this and reprimanded him severely for it threatening to chastise him if ever he did so again but unhappily this child knew not or else did not believe that one should not do amiss even when alone because god is always near us and sees whatever we do one day when his father was gone out thinking that nobody could see him and therefore that he should not be punished he filled his pocket with stones and began pelting them all round him just at the same time mr vicars was in his garden with his son gamaliel this boy had the misfortune to think as well as simon that it was enough not to do amiss before others and that when alone one might do what one pleased his father had a gun charged to shoot the sparrows that came picking his cherries and he was sitting in a summer house to watch them at this moment a servant came to tell him that a strange gentleman wanted him in the parlour he therefore left the gun in the summer house and expressly forbid gamaliel to touch it but gamaliel when all alone said to himself i dont see what harm there would be in playing with this gun a little and saying thus he took it up and began to exercise with it like a soldier he handled his arms and rested his firelock and had a mind to try if he could make ready and present the muzzle of his gun happened to be pointed toward mr dobsons garden and just as he was going to shut the left eye in order to take aim a pebble stone thrown by simon struck him in that very eye the fright and the pain together made gamaliel drop the gun which went off and oh what cries and shrieks were immediately heard in both gardens gamaliel had received a blow of a stone in the eye and simon received the whole charge of the gun in his leg thus the one lost his eye and the other remained a cripple all the rest of his life   frank ah poor simon poor gamaliel how i pity them   mr ferg they were it is true very much to be pitied but their parents still more so for having children so disobedient and vicious after all it was a real happiness for these two bad boys to have met with this accident   frank how so papa   mr ferg i will tell you if god had not early punished these children they would always have continued in mischief whenever they found themselves alone whereas they experienced by this warning that whatever bad actions men do not see god sees and punishes this was therefore a lesson to them to amend themselves and they became thenceforth prudent and sedate and shunned doing mischief when alone as much as if all the world saw them and this indeed was the design of providence in thus punishing them for our merciful creator never chastises us but to make us become better   frank well that eye and leg will make me take care i will shen what is wrong and do what is right even though i see nobody near me  as he had finished these words they arrived at their own housedoor   the good son a drama in two acts the following is rather animitation or paraphrase than a translation of the drama which bears the same titi in the french of mr ber the necessity of deviating from the original will be ous to every reader the french drama is also imitated

lieut goodacre oh certainly certainly father   nanny and we my dear son will go to see you in return they will be days of happiness to us when we see you and we shall never cease to bless heaven for having given us such a son   physiognomy mr oakley having one day surprised his daughter arabella very busy before her glass they had the following conversation on the subject  mr oakley why arabella you are dressed very fine i suppose it is to receive or to pay visits   arabella yes papa i am to spend the evening with the miss monktons   mr oakley i thought you were going to figure in a circle of duchesses what needs all this dressing for friends that you see every day   arabella why papa you know  when one goes out one should not be in a dishabille as at home   mr oakley then you are generally in dishabille at home   arabella no papa  but you know there ought to be a difference   mr oakley i understand you mean that you should be a little more attentive to your dress but i thought as i came in that you seemed busy in examining your looks and your figure does your glass tell you that your studies have succeeded arabella tooks down and blushes what is your intention   arabella papa one always likes to please and  we would not appear so as to frighten people   mr oakley ha ha then it depends on our choice to please people or to frighten them   arobella not entirely but i meant  as others do when they say one looks like a fright   mr oakley i should like to know what that means it may be of use to myself   arabella why for instance when one is pitted deeply with the smallpox or has a great long nose and chin or a wide mouth   mr oakley thank heaven you have none of these but rather indeed a sensible little countenance what more do you want in order to please universally and not to be a fright   arabella ah i cannot tell how it is but i know some little misses that have very handsome faces and yet they do not please me and i know other that are not counted handsome and yet i like their faces very much   mr oakley can you trust me with your thoughts tell me those first that are handsome and yet have not the good luck to please your taste   arabella that is easily done in the first place there is miss bloomer she has a clear smooth skin as white as a lily with fine blue eyes and rosy lips but she has an affected loll which makes her seem lower than she is and she hangs her head on one shoulder so that her face looks quite another thing then she draws out her words slowly as if she weighed each syllable and in speaking she looks at you expecting you to admire every sentence in the next place there is the eldest miss archly she passes for a beauty but her looks are so proud and sneering that when we are a number of us together we cannot help thinking she despises or ridicules us as for miss drake she carries herself with so much confidence and speaks with such an air of command that a boy would blush    mr oakley softly at this rate we shall fall into scandal i would rather hear you mention those who without being handsome have found means to please you   arabella you know miss emily johnson she is much marked with the smallpox and even has a pearl on her left eye from it but yet her countenance is so pleasing that one may read in it goodnature mildness and complaisance the youngest miss archly has the smallest cast in the world with her eyes from having had something hung before one eye that was sore for almost a twelvemonth when she was young she looks to the right to see what is on her left hand well it is nothing when one becomes used to it and we all love her dearly she is so lively and so gay   mr oakley you seen then outward advantages such as a fair soft skin white teeth a handsome nose rosy lips a fine easy shape in short all the beauties of face or person are not sufficient by themselves to make one please one must have besides a happy countenance and engaging manners   arabella certainly papa for otherwise i cannot tell how some please me who are neither handsome nor well shaped and how others are disagreeable with all these advantages   mr oakley but can you tell why the first have something in their countenances more agreeable to us than the regular features of the second   arabella because i should think one sees there some figns of their disposition and we are apt to think that those who have an appearance of goodnature in the features of the face must have a good heart   mr oakley when you were before your glass you strove no doubt to throw a little goodnature into your countenance that people might imagine you to possess it in your disposition too   arabella oh pray papa do not make game of me   mr oakley i do not mean it but you told me just now that you wished to please and you owned this to be the surest method of doing so   arabella yes certainly   mr oakley but do you think that such a countenance may not be deceitful or that one can assume the power of pleasing and lay it down at pleasure   arabella yes papa i think so for i have heard you and others say a hundred times i would never have thought that little girl to have such a deceitful countenance  that man looked like honesty itself and yet he has deceived us  such a person knows how to compose his face so that one would swear him to be possessed of every virtue   mr oakley but did we speak then of those that we had seen often or for a long time or pretty near us   arabella ah i do not know that papa   mr oakley or might not this wrong judgment proceed from a want of sagacity or from not sufficiently remarking whether such persons have always the same countenance or only take it up upon occasion or in short whether they speak and act consistently and uniformly   arabella what is the meaning of that papa   mr oakley whether every thing agrees their countenance their eyes the sound of their voice all the features of their face whether any part contradicts or gives the lie to the other   arabella oh there are a good many things to mind in that and yet i should imagine if i saw any one a long time and pretty often and took particular notice of what you have mentioned i could not be mistaken   mr oakley ah child do not be too sure   arabella however i think i can see in my little friends what is affected and what is natural   mr oakley so then you suppose that you are knowing enough in the art of disguising the thoughts and that you have judgment and penetration enough to distinguish truth from hypocrisy upon a countenance really i should never have expected so much from so light a little head as yours   arabella oh i have taken notice in miss bloomer that her prim mouth her stare her motions with her head and that drawling tone of hers are not natural and that the elder miss archlys proud flouting look and miss drakes free undaunted manner is not at all affected because the one is really vain and selfconceited and the other impudent   mr oakley perhaps they are not far enough advanced in the art of putting on counterfeit looks however your opinion is that our aversions and our likings our faults and our virtues are painted on our faces and that one can read in a persons features as in a book what he is in the bottom of his heart   arabella why not i never saw a passionate person with a mild aspect nor an envious person with a smiling countenance nor one who was cruel and unfeeling with looks of tenderness only see our neighbor mrs grimston how she eyes people as if she would eat them up and with what a grumbling voice she speaks every time that miss artichoke the old maid comes here when mama has company only observe how her eyes go round to see if any lady present has any thing new or elegant about her dress and with what looks of jealousy she measures her from head to foot as if she was hurt at anothers happiness   mr oakley why indeed we may pretty safely pronounce that the one is envious and the other passionate but may it not sometimes happen that nature should give the same person a happy countenance and a perverse disposition or on the other hand indifferent features along with a noble heart   arabella i do not know but i can hardly believe it   mr oakley why so   arabella because we may see by a persons figure whether he is weak or strong sickly or in health and it must be the same with the disposition   mr oakley well now i shall give you two passages from history that seem to contradict your notion a certain able physiognomist called zopyrus boasted that from a view of a persons shape and countenance he could distinguish his manners and ruling passions after one day looking at socrates he judged him to be a man of a bad mind and vicious inclinations some of which he mentioned alcibiades the friend and scholar of socrates who was well acquainted with his masters merit could not help laughing at the judgment of the physiognomist and taxing him with gross ignorance but socrates confessed that he was really by nature inclined to those vices of which he was accused and that he preserved himself free from them by the constant exertions of philosophy aesop that slave who was endowed with so much wit had a person so disagreeable and deformed that when he stood to be sold he could prevail on nobody to purchase him until his witty answers showed them convincingly what he was  here are two examples that seem to prove the contrary of what you maintained   arabella well now that surprises me as to socrates i have often heard you talk of him with admiration and as to aesop too i have read his fables with so much pleasure i should have thought them both the finest looking persons in the world but however it agrees again with what i said that one may be ordinary and yet have i dont know what of wit sensibility or goodnature in the countenance   mr oakley you are right sickness or grief may alter the features but that was not the case with socrates he owned himself that he was at first viciously inclined and the features of his face strongly confirmed it   arabella i think his answer explains the difficulty he was born with a bad disposition but as he had much good sense at the same time and saw that passion pride and envy were terrible vices he struggled with them and came at length to get the better of them his heart was purged of his faults but his countenance kept the marks of them still   mr oakley you seem to be pretty ready at a reply nay there is some truth too in your reasoning however i have a small question to propose to you  if miss archly that proud little miss who has a face you say expressing disdain and selfconceit should from the sensible instructions of her parents be convinced of her own folly or if distresses and sickness obliged her to endeavor to render herself agreeable to others by being mild affable and mannerly so that she should become quite the contrary to what she is at present and suppose it were the same with your other little friends as to the faults that you find in them also would those marks of pride affectation or impudence remain still upon their faces or when by continual and redoubled efforts they should have changed their vices into the opposite virtues would the same alteration take place in their countenances   arabella yes certainly papa   mr oakley well the truth may lie between our different ways of arguing socrates when young yielded to the folly of his passions and even retained for a long time his choleric temper since he entreated his friends to admonish him whenever they saw him ready to give way to it but in a more advanced age when he had been instructed in the school of wisdom he began undoubtedly to combat his vices to reform himself daily and to rise by degrees to the highest pitch of perfect on in every moral virtue but then it was too late to newmodel his features the muscles and fibers of his face becoming stiff the beauty of his mind could make no impression through his countenance it was like the sun in a cloudy sky now in childhood when the features are more tender and flexible the different movements of the soul are in their turns forcibly impressed on them so that if by a reform during that period the virtues take place of the vices in the mind the outward expression of these virtues on the countenance will also efface that of the vices for the countenance may be compared to a thin veil if you throw it over the head of a fair circassian and afterward over that of a negro wench you will easily see through it the florid bloom of the one and the sooty blackness of the other i do not know whether you understand what i mean   arabelia oh yes perfectly from that comparison and to show you that i do i will give you one of my own i have often with the greatest ease cut the letters of my name or the date of the year upon a young tree but i could not do so upon an old one the bark would have been too hard and too rugged   mr oakley why you surprise me but even though your comparison should not be quite exact it is certainly true that if we do not take up a habit of virtue until an advanced age we shall appear the less amiable in the eyes of others because our features long accustomed to express our former vicious inclinations can with difficulty be modelled to represent our present virtuous sentiments and what are we to conclude from this   arabella that we should  that we should    mr oakley consider well before you express yourself   arabella that we should endeavor while young to have an amiable countenance   mr oakley but if we are not in our heart what our countenance denotes would not the contrast be remarked you said just now of miss bloomer that she was not what she wished to be thought so you see    arabella yes i see that we should strive to be really what we wish to appear so for instance if we would appear mild modest reserved or goodnatured we should struggle against all those inclinations that would hinder us to be so in effect otherwise our counterfeit looks will soon be discovered for if one is really mild modest reserved or goodnatured the features of his face will show it   mr oakley very well my dear arabella and is not that an excellent receipt for obtaining true beauty and the genuine art of pleasing how unhappy would those be to whom nature has refused her charms if they were debarred the hopes of acquiring an amiable and engaging countenance by goodness of heart and other qualities most pleasing in the sight of god and man therefore my dear take my advice do not go to seek in your glass for the art of appearing better than you really are but whenever you find yourself ruffled by any passion run immediately and consult it you will see the ugliness of envy anger or vanity then ask yourself if such a portrait can be agreeable in the eyes of either god or man   arabella yes papa your advice is very good and i will follow it but i shall reap another advantage from your instructions   mr oakley what is that   arabella i will look very attentively at every body that i see in company and strive to discover by their faces what opinion i should have of them   mr oakley no child take care how you do so the first would be contrary to good manners and unsuitable to the modesty of your sex and the second would be very dangerous considering your candor and inexperience to discover in the features of any person his disposition or way of thinking requires long study repeated observations and a very penetrating judgment you would find yourself continually deceived in your likings or dislikes the knowledge of the world will instruct you by degrees at present study only yourself and use all the strength of your mind to acquire every virtue in order to become more amiable and more beautiful   narcissus and hippolytus narcissus and hippolytus were nearly of the same age and loved each other from their earliest infancy as their parents were close neighbors they had opportunities of being together every day mr chambers the father of narcissus had a place under government the profits of which were immense but the father of hippolytus mr marvel possessed a moderate fortune on which however he lived content and all his views aimed at making his son happy by the advantages of a well directed education since he had it not in his power to leave him great riches to obtain this end he made choice of means the most worthy of his prudence hippolytus at nine years of age was formed to all the exercises of the body and his understanding enriched with many useful acquirements being constantly in exercise and motion he was healthy and robust always contented and happy in the affection of his parents he enjoyed a mild cheerfulness which communicated its influence to these who had the happiness of being in his company his little neighbor narcissus was one who felt this happiness for the moment that hippolytus left him he would be quite at a loss for amusement that his time might not hang wearisome he was continually eating without being hungry drinking without being dry and dozing without being sleepy so that scarce a day passed but he was troubled with qualms of the stomach or violent headachs mr chambers as well as mr marvel tenderly wished his sons happiness but to procure it he had unfortunately taken the means which were quite opposite to his end narcissus from the cradle had been bred up with the utmost delicacy he had always a servant behind him to hand him a chair whenever he had a mind to change his seat he was dressed and undrest as if he had not the use of his hands it seemed as if all those who were about him only breathed for him and that he could not help himself even to live while hippolytus in a thin linen jacket helped his father to cultivate a little garden for his amusement narcissus in a fine scarlet coat was lolling in a chariot paying morning visits with his mama if ever he went to take the country air and alighted out of the carriage but for a moment they took particular care to put his great coat on and a handkerchief round his head for fear he should catch cold accustomed as he was to be humoured in his slightest fancies he wished for every thing that he saw but this wish lasted only for a moment and the more troublesome it was to procure him what he wished the sooner he was tired of it to spare him the smallest subject of ill humor his mother had ordered all the servants to respect even his follies this illjudged indulgence made him so whimsical and imperious that every body in the house hated and despised him besides his parents hippolytus was the only person that loved him and could patiently put up with his humors he knew how to manage his temper and could make him even good humoured like himself  how do you contrive to be always so merry said mr chambers to him one day i do not well know sir answered he it comes of itself but my papa tells me that one is never perfectly happy without mixing a little work with ones play and i have observed it too whenever any strangers come to our house and we quit our work to entertain them i never find my time hang heavy but on such days it is this mixture of exercise and amusement that makes me always be in good health i fear neither the winds nor the rain neither the heat of the day nor the cold of the evening and i have almost dug up a whole plat in my garden before poor narcissus quits his bed of a morning mr chambers heaved a sigh and that very day he went to consult mr marvel how he should act in order to make his son as healthy and as cheerful as hippolytus mr marvel took pleasure in answering his questions and laid before him the plan that he had followed the powers of the body and of the mind said he should be equally kept in exercise unless they are meant to be unserviceable as money buried in the ground would be even to its owner nothing can be imagined more prejudicial to the health and happiness of children than to give them a pusillanimous turn by using them to excessive delicacy and from a pernicious complaisance to give way to their whimsical and obstinate humors to what vexatious disappointments will not a man be exposed who has been accustomed from his childhood to see even his follies flattered since of all the warmest wishes of his heart he may happen to see scarcely one accomplished and thus be led basely to murmur against his destiny when he should for the most part thank heaven for rejecting his infatuated vows he added with tokens of heartfelt satisfaction that hippolytus would certainly never be that unhappy person mr chambers was struck with this discourse and resolved to conduct his son to happiness by the same way alas it was too late narcissus now was fourteen years old and his mind so long enervated could not bear any exertion though ever so little fatiguing his mother as weak as himself entreated her husband not to teaze their darling her husband wearied out with these entreaties dropped the sensible design that he had formed and the darling sunk more and more into habits of pernicious effeminacy thus the strength of his body declined in proportion as his mind was degraded by ignorance at seath when he had gained the age of seventeen his parents sent him to the university intending him afterward for the study of the law hippolytus being destined for the same profession accompanied his young friend i had forgot to mention that hippolytus in his different studies and acquirements had never had any other instructor than his father narcissus had as many masters as there are different accomplishments to acquire and he remembered a few of the terms used by each of them tolerably well this was all the fruit of his studies the understanding of hippolytus on the contrary was like a garden whose airy situation every where admits the kindly rays of the sun and in which every seed by a judicious cultivation comes rapidly to the growth already well instructed he earnestly desired fresh knowledge his diligence and good behavior afforded a pattern for imitation to his companions his mild temper his lively apprehension and joyous humor made his company strongly attracting every body loved him and every body wished to be his friend narcissus at first was happy to be in the same lodging with him but very soon his pride mortified by the esteem that hippolytus had acquired would not suffer him to be longer a witness to it he therefore separated from him upon a frivoious pretense being now left to himself and his own vitiated taste he sighed for pleasure and thoughtlessly snatched at whatever seemed to offer her deceitful image to his view i shall not attempt to describe to you how often he blushed for himself and how from one imprudence to another he fell at last into the grossest irregularities it will suffice to inform you that he returned to his fathers house with the seeds of a mortal distemper in his bosom that he languished six months on a bed of pain and expired in the severest agonies hippolytus came home to his parents regretted both by his teachers and his companions and enriched with a treasure of learning and prudence with what transports of joy was he received by his family o children how sweet a thing it is to make ourselves beloved by all who know us and at the same time to feel ourselves worthy of this universal affection his mother thought herself the happiest of women and tears of joy filled his fathers eyes whenever he beheld him a considerable employment in his profession was conferred on him with the unanimous approbation of all who knew his character and enabled him to gratify his ardent desire of promoting the happiness of his friends and he enjoyed their happiness as much as they did themselves his parents too shared the same generous sentiments and lived in affluence to a good old age he took pleasure in repaying them with interest the attentions which they had showed for him a wife endowed with beauty and virtue and children resembling himself made his happiness complete whenever therefore any man was mentioned as being both happy and worthy to be so the name of hippolytus always occurred first to the thoughts of those who knew him  the man who rose to sudden fortune one fine evening in the month of june mr russel went out with his son eugene to take a walk in some of the most agreeable environs of the city the weather was mild the sky clear the purling streams and waving trees lulled them to an agreeable thoughtfulness what a lovely evening said eugene enchanted with the beauties of nature that surrounded him he pressed his fathers hand and said to him if you knew papa what thoughts rise in my heart he was silent for a moment then lifting up toward heaven his eyes which were moistened with tears i thank my god said he for the happy moments that he gives me to enjoy oh that every body could taste the beauties of the evening as i do that all mankind overflowed with joy as i do at this moment i could wish to be king over a large country that i might make all my subjects happy mr russel embraced his son my dear eugene said he the benevolent wish that you have just expressed comes from a heart as generous as humane but would not your thoughts change with your fortune would you preserve in an exalted station these sentiments that animate you now in the middling condition to which heaven has appointed you  eugene why do you ask that question papa cannot one become rich without becoming cruel or wicked   mr russel it does not always happen so my dear there are some fortunate persons who remember their past distresses and in whom this reflection produces sentiments of charity toward the unfortunate but to the disgrace of the human heart a change of fortune frequently alters affections the most tender and sympathetic while we are unfortunate ourselves we think that heaven requires it of all men as a duty to relieve our sufferings if the hand of god remove misfortune from us we conclude all his intents in the preservation of the universe to be fulfilled and we no longer think of those wretches that remain in the gulf from which we have been rescued we have an instance of this in the man who comes sometimes to ask relief of me i give it to him with a reluctance that i cannot conquer though i reproach myself for it   eugene why true papa i observed that you put your alms coldly into his hand without ever giving him those words of comfort that you do to other poor people   mr russel i will show you my dear whether he deserves them mr low was a linendraper in the minories though the profits of his business were but moderate a poor person never appeared at his door in vain this was all the pleasure that he indulged himself in purchasing and he thought himself happy to enjoy it though he could not command even this to the full extent of his wishes business called him one day upon change he saw in one part of it a number of principal merchants together who were talking of vast cargoes and immense profits to be expected from them ah said he to himself sighing how happy these people are if i were as rich heaven knows i should not be so for myself alone and that the poor should partake of my abundance he goes home full of ambitious thoughts but how can his narrow business enable him to fulfill his vast projects with tolerable economy it was no more than sufficient to afford him a decent subsistence the year ound i shall always be at a stand here cried he and never rise above this middling condition in which i linger at present a handbill inviting adventurers to purchase in the lottery was at this moment put into his hand he seized the idea with eagerness as if inspired by fortune and without minding the inconvenience to which his covetousness might reduce him he went to the lotteryoffice and laid out four guineas the only money that he could spare in the world with what impatience he waited for the drawing he one time repented having so foolishly hazarded a stake the loss of which would disturb him at another time he fancied that he saw riches falling down upon him in showers at last the drawing began   eugene well papa did he get a prize   mr russel five thousand pounds   eugene aha he would jump for joy   mr russel he went immediately and received his money and spent some days in thinking of nothing else when he had had enough of that i can put this sum to a better use said he than barely poring over it he therefore enlarged his stock extended his dealings and by his activity and knowledge of trade he soon doubled his capital in less than ten years he became one of the richest men in the city it must be said in his praise that he had till then been faithful to his vow in making the poor partake of his abundance at the fight of an unfortunate person he remembered his own former condition without being ashamed of it and this recollection never failed of profiting the person who occasioned it led by degrees to frequent fine company he contracted a taste for luxury and dissipation he purchased a magnificent countryhouse and fine gardens and his life became a round of pleasures and amusement the most extravagant whims he gratified without scruple but soon perceived that they had made a considerable breach in his fortune trade which he had given up in order to be quite at leisure to enjoy himself no longer enabled him to repair it besides a habit of indulgence and a mean vanity would not suffer him to lessen his expenses i shall always have enough for one thought he let others provide for themselves his heart hardened in this resolution was thenceforth shut to the unfortunate he heard the cries of misery around him as one hears the tempest grumble when sheltered from its fury friends whom he had till then supported came to solicit him for fresh relief but he refused them harshly have i made a fortune said he only to squander it upon you do as i do said he depend upon yourselves his mother whom he had cut short of half the pension that he allowed her came to beg for a retired shelter in a corner of his house there to spend her few remaining days but he had the barbarity to refuse her and with dry eyes beheld her die in misery this crime however did not long remain unpunished his debaucheries very soon exhausted all his wealth and deprived him of the strength necessary to support himself by work in short he was reduced to the state of misery in which you see him and now begs his bread from door to door an object of contempt and indignation to all honest people   eugene ah papa since fortune can make men so wicked i wish to remain as i am   mr russel my dear eugene i wish the same for the sake of your happiness but if heaven destines you to a more exalted station may you never forseit the nobleness and generosity of your soul think often of the story that i have just now told you learn from this example that we can never taste true happiness without feeling for the misfortunes of others that it is the powerful mans duty to comfort the sorrows of the weak and that he reaps more true happiness from the performance of this duty than from all his pomp and luxury  the sun was now going to set and his parting beams threw a lively glow upon the clouds which seemed to form a purple curtain round his bed the air freshened at the approach of evening breathed an agreeable calm the birds in repeating their farewell songs rallied all their powers of melody the leaves of the grove mingled a gentle murmur with their concert and every thing seemed to inspire sentiments of joy and happiness but eugene and his father instead of the transports which they had felt at first returned home lost in melancholy reflections   the greyhound and the ring a drama in two acts characters mr calvert serina his daughter eustace his son lionel friends to eustace rufus friends to eustace scene an apartment in mr calverts house  act i scene i serina alone ah my poor little diana i shall never be able to sit at work without you it was here on this little cushion that you lay down beside me while i was at my needle how joyful and pleased were we both when you awoke you would run shaking your tail under the sopha and under the chairs and tables and then jump from one to the other how happy did you appear when i took you in my lap how you would lik my hands and face and play with me oh how sorry shall i be if i never see you again ah i should never have lost you myself but that careless    scene ii serina eustace eustace overhearing these last words i see my name is called in question   serina ay whose else should it be if you had not been so positive in taking her out with you yesterday she would not have been lost   eustace that is true and i am as sorry for it as you are but what can i do now   serina did i not beg of you to leave her at home but you could not go a step without having her at your heels   eustace i own it i was so pleased when she was along with me to see her walk sometimes before me and sometimes behind me then she would run from me as if i was pursuing her and come back again at full speed and jump up about me so playful   serina then you should have taken better care of her   eustace yes i should so but as she used to go away from me and come back of herself without any occasion for my calling her i thought    serina you thought  you have never the least mistrust of any thing and by that poor diana was lost   eustace i promise you sister the next time    serina yes another time when we have nothing to lose i could not sleep a quarter of an hour together all last night i thought i heard her whining to me at a distance and that i ran to the side from which her cries seemed to come then i awoke and found myself alone ah i dare say she is as dull too for her part   eustace dear sister it makes me doubly unhappy to see you grieve so i would give all that i am worth in the world to have her again   serina now you make me grieve still more why dont you know at least where you missed her one might enquire amongst all the neighbors thereabouts   eustace i would lay a wager she followed me into this street and almost as far as our own house too but as she runs up into every court smelling about somebody must have shut their door upon her and kept her in   serina yes i dare say it was so otherwise she would have come back to her lodging she knows the way to it well enough   eustace lionel was along with me and declared to me that he saw her but the moment before we missed her and it was his fault for he was playing such comical tricks as we walked along that i forgot diana just then   serina well he should have helped you at least to look for her   eustace so he did all yesterday evening and today again very early we went into all the streets and lanes round about and searched every court and market near us we enquired in short among all our acquaintances but could hear nothing of her indeed sister i am ashamed to look you in the face i know you must be angry with me   serina taking him by the hand no i am not angry now you did not mean to disoblige me and besides you are so sorry yourself but who is this coming up stairs go and see   scene iii serina eustace lionel lionel opening the door it is i it is i eustace good morning to you miss serina   serina good morning master lionel   lionel i have got a scent of diana and i hope pretty soon    serina what to find her again   lionel i will tell you you know that old woman that lives at the corner of the street and sells cakes and garden stuff   serina what has she my little dog   lionel no no she is a very honest woman and a good friend of mine you know eustace that diana too wanted the other day to scrape acquaintance with her standing up with her paws upon the counter and smelling at the biscuits   eustace ah yes but her little fond tricks would not do there for the old woman gave her a great stroke on the nose with her glove   serina oh that is nothing well master lionel   lionel well just now i went to her shop to buy some cakes and was telling her of our loss what says she that little cur dog    serina cur dog master lionel dont call my pretty diana so i would rather not hear you talk of her at all   lionel nay i only tell you her own words that little cur dog says she that belongs to that pretty young gentleman your acquaintance yes said i the same well you know another little master that lives here below at the large house with the balcony it was he that coaxed her away   eustace how could she mean rufus   lionel dont you remember that he was at the old womans shop yesterday as we passed and pretended not to see us for fear of being obliged to offer us some of his walnuts   eustace that is very true i recollect it now   lionel well when we had past her house a little way he called diana as she was following us and offered her a bit of cake and while the poor thing was busy feasting herself he snatched her up in his arms and carried her home the good woman told me the whole trick   serina an illnatured creature well however we know where she is brother you had better go to him without any more ado   lionel i am greatly afraid that he would not find her there rufus has taken her only to sell her as he does his books and whatever else he can purloin at his fathers he is capable of any thing why we were playing at marbles the other day and he cheated   eustace ay is that his way i will run to him this moment   lionel you will not find him at home i have just been there and he was out   serina perhaps he bid them say that he was not at home   lionel no i went up to his room and i told the maid that i wanted him to come and play at marbles and that i would wait for him at your house   serina he will never have the face to show himself here if he has really taken diana   lionel ah you do not know his assurance he would come here on purpose that you might not suspect him but i will convict him before you   serina we must go cunningly to work and question him slily to make him discover the secret   lionel i will tell you all the cunning required is to show him at the first word that he is a rogue and a thief   eustace no no my dear lionel that would only bing on a quarrel and my papa would not have any here mild words perhaps will touch him better than reproaches or violence   serina perhaps too he does not know that the little greyhound is ours   lionel not know does not he see her along with your brother every day he has played with her a hundred times and stole her yesterday to sell her that is just his character   eustace hist here he comes   scene iv serina eustace lionel rufus rufus they told me at home lionel that you wanted me to play at marbles come i am ready ah eustace how do you do your humble servant miss   serina you are going to your diversion master rufus nothing gives you uneasiness but we are all in trouble here   rufus what is the matter then   serina we have lost our pretty little greyhound   rufus dear that is a pity she was a pretty little creature indeed her body so handsome a gre with black spots here and there and her breast and forefeet and tail all white she is worth two guineas if she is worth a farthing   serina you know her so well could not you help us to fd her again   rufus do you take me for a dogkeeper or am i obliged to look after yours   eustace my sister did not mean to affront you rufus   serina oh dear no it was only a civil question as you live in our neighborhood and she was lost not far off i thought that you might have been able to give us some account of her   lionel certainly you could not apply to a better person   rufus what do you mean by that master lionel   lionel what is best known to yourself though i am perfectly acquainted too with the whole affair   rufus if it were not out of respect to miss    lionel you should thank her yourself that i do not chastise you for your impudence   eustace taking lionel aside softly my dear lionel or we shall lose the greyhound   serina if as you say you have some regard for me master rufus be so good as to hear me attentively and answer me yes or no   lionel and without shuffling   serina have not you our greyhound or dont you know where she is   rufus confused i i your greyhound   lionel do you stammer at the question you have her and i know the whole story too you took her treacherously coaxing her with a bit of cake   rufus who told you so   lionel one that saw you do it   serina i ask it as a favor of you master rufus to tell me is that true or false   rufus and suppose i did give your dog a bit of cake or that i took her up a moment to play with her is that a reason that i should have her or know what is become of her   serina nor do we say so we only ask you if you know where she is just now   eustace or if you did not keep her at your house last night out of a frolic to frighten us a little and afterward to give us the pleasure of a surprise   rufus what do you take our house for a dogkennel   lionel he must have a vast deal of assurance   rufus i have nothing to say to you you may be counselor fr greyhounds as long as you will i will not be examined by you   lionel because i have confounded you   serina softly master lionel you must be mistaken i cannot suspect master rufus of so much meanness as to keep our dog if he had found it   eustace if he had lost any thing and i could give him an account of it i would do it with pleasure so he need not be angry at our questions   rufus i am very angry at them and i will make a complaint of it to your father   lionel you had better come to the cakewomans house i will go along with you   rufus it is very pretty of you to believe such a prating gossip before me   lionel such gossips however have eyes and ears and as far as honesty is concerned i should trust them sooner than you   rufus i will not put up with this affront and you shall pay for it he goes out   scene v serina eustace lionel lionel what an impudent liar i would lay my life that he has the dog did not you see how he was confounded when i told him flatly that he had her   serina i cannot believe it yet and indeed it would be quite too scandalous   lionel you cannot believe it miss because your own heart is so good for my part i can believe any thing of him   serina i must own however that it was very rude not to answer our questions civilly   lionel if you had not been here miss i would have tweaked him by the ears a little   eustace tut man he is taller than you by the head   lionel if he was twice as tall i will wager he is a coward did not you observe that he grew more impudent as we were more civil and the harder i pushed him the quieter he became but i will go and follow him and take diana from him wherever he has put her   serina your pains would be to no purpose master lionel once more i cannot believe it he lives too near us to expect to hide such a theft from us   eustace i hope he may not go and kill her for fear of being found out in a lie   lionel no my friend he will not kill her he keeps her for sale   serina o heavens what an opinion you have of him   lionel it is such as he deserves and i will go and convince you of it   scene vi serina eustace eustace lionel is too hot he makes a terrible quarrel of the smallest difference if they must wrangle i am glad at least that it is not here   serina for then papa would give us a fine lesson lionel i believe is willing to serve us but i am sorry that he seems to seek his own revenge more than our advantage   eustace he desires no better than to be in every quarrel and he has done us more harm than good if rufus really stole diana he would return her to me sooner for good words than for threats but here comes papa   scene vii mr calvert serina eustace mr calv what have you done to rufus he came to me as i was in my room and seemed quite ruffled he complains of you very much but particularly of lionel and says that you accuse him of stealing diana is she lost   eustace ah yes papa i did not like to tell you because i hoped every moment to find her again she went astray from me yesterday evening   serina ah you cannot imagine how sorry i am for her i cried the best part of last night when i awoke and missed her from my side   mr calv luckily it is but a dog losses of much more consequence happen every day in the world and we should early accustom ourselves to bear with them but you to eustace why did not you take care of her   eustace you are very right papa it was my fault i should have left her at home or else not have lost sight of her since i took her in my charge and i am sorry for it especially on account of my sister because diana was hers more than mine   serina i cannot be angry with my brother for it i have sometimes vexed him without intention and he has excused me   mr calv kiss me my dear child i love to see you bear a misfortune with courage but i am still better pleased to see you in the midst of your grief not the least provoked against him that occasioned it   serina my poor brother is sufficiently punished for his negligence for he was as fond of diana as i she was all his amusement and he grieves besides that he was the occasion of my uneasiness   mr calv always preserve these sentiments my dear children one toward the other and indeed toward all your fellow creatures for they are of the same family i know many persons who for such a trifle would have turned away an honest servant   serina oh heaven forbid prefer a dog to a servant a creature without reason to a person of our own kind   mr calv why do not all men make that difference as well as you my dear child we should not then know those who would rather see a poor child suffer hunger or thirst than a favorite dog who shed tears at the indisposition of a spaniel and look without pity on the lot of an unhappy orphan abandoned by all the world   serina papa is it possible   mr calv in return for the sentiment which draws that generous sigh from your breast i promise you my dear a greyhound as handsome as the one that you have lost if you are not lucky enough to find her again   serina no papa i thank you i have suffered too much from the loss of diana if she does not come back i will never have another i will not run the risque of grieving so again   mr calv you carry things too far my dear serina in that case we must resign all the most agreeable pleasures of life we should be afraid to love a friend because death or absence might one day separate us from him if you compare the pleasure which dianas playful fondness has afforded you ever since she was born to the short uneasiness that her loss occasions to you now the first you will find exceeds the second by a great deal nothing is more natural than to be fond of a pretty little creature like diana and indeed it would be a mark of ingratitude in you    serina yes if i did not think of her now because she is not here to play about me   mr calv what comforts me a little in this misfortune is that from this you will be better enabled to bear perhaps a greater every thing that we possess upon earth may slip from our hands with the same readiness and it is wise to accustom ourselves early to the most severe losses but with regard to our first subject of conversation you have treated rufus ill it seems   serina not we papa we spoke to him very mildly it was lionel that touched him close a little   mr calv and what did he say in answer   eustace he defended himself but lamely indeed he was quite out of countenance at the first question   serina but now i will ask you papa do you think that he could have the assurance to deny it if he had really taken my greyhound   mr calv i can say nothing as to that but i should think his confusion could not come from a very clear conscience however that we may have no reproach to make to ourselves concerning diana we must advertise her tomorrow in the public papers   eustace but papa if she is really in his power that trouble will be useless   mr calv no it cannot be useless a dog requires to be fed and is not so small or so quiet that one can hide it from every bodys eyes there may happen to be some person in his house honest enough to give us information of it i will not apply to his father i know his rude manners too well besides he is offended with me for forbidding you a too close intimacy with his son we must wait to see what our advertisement will produce   serina i should have some hopes from it if i were able to promise a large reward to whoever would bring me back the dog   mr calv i shall take care of that come eustace into my closet we will put down her description and you shall take it to the printingoffice   serina oh what joy it would be for the poor little creature and for me too to see each other once more   act ii scene i eustace serina eustace running into the room overjoyed sister sister   serina what is the matter you seem to be in high spirits is diana found   eustace diana oh something much better see showing a ring in a small case look at what i have found not a yard from our door   serina oh the charming ring but the stone that should be in the middle where is that   eustace i suppose it had fallen out see here it is in a paper look at this diamond in the light see how it sparkles my papas brilliant is not so large   serina i pity him very much that has lost it   eustace it is worse than to lose a greyhound   serina oh i dont know that my little diana was so pretty and so fond of us and then we had her a whelp oh when i think how happy we were to see her learn new tricks as she grew bigger and to amuse ourselves with her play the finest ring that ever i could put on my finger would not make me half so happy   eustace but with this ring you might buy a hundred gray hounds like her   serina it should not buy mine for all that he that lost the ring has others perhaps and i had only my poor diana i am worse off than he is   eustace it must belong to a rich man poor people have not such toys as this   serina yet if it was some unfortunate servant that lost it in taking it to the jeweller  or if it was the jeweller himself the diamond being loose would make one suspect so what a misfortune it would be for the poor people   eustace you are right well now i am quite out of humor with my prize we must ask papas advice about it oh this is lucky here he comes   scene ii mr calvert eustace serina mr calv well will the advertisement for your greybound be in tomorrows paper   eustace papa i have not been at the office yet here is what kept me a ring that i have found gives him the case   mr calv a very fine diamond indeed   eustace ant it this is enough to put a little dog out of ones head for a moment or two   mr calv yes if it were your own do you intend to keep it   eustace why if nobody makes inquiry about it   mr calv did any body see you take it up   eustace no papa   serina for my part i should never rest until i knew who owned it   eustace let the owner show himself and certainly the ring shall not stay long in my hands no that would be as bad as if i had stolen it we must give every one his own   mr calv you will not be perhaps so well pleased then   eustace why not papa i own i did not think of any thing at first but my good luck in finding such a jewel i looked upon it as already my property but my sister has given me an idea of the trouble that he must feel who lost it i should be much happier in putting an end to his uneasiness than in keeping this ring which would make me blush every time that i looked at it   serina there is so much pleasure in comforting those who are troubled for that reason i cannot imagine that rufus or any other could be so illnatured as to keep my diana if he knew how sorry i am for her   mr calv kissing them amiable little innocents my dear children how i rejoice in being your father let such generous sentiments continue to spring up and gain strength in your hearts they will be the foundation of your own happiness and that of your fellow creatures   serina you give us the example papa how should we have other sentiments   eustace oh i will go and show my prize to every body and we should advertise both together in the papers that we have lost a greyhound and found a ring   mr calv not so fast my dear there are precautions to be taken there might be some people who would claim the ring without being the owners   serina oh i should be as cunning as they i would ask them first how it was made and i would not give it to any but him that told me very particularly   mr calv that way is not the surest neither a person may have seen it upon the owners finger and come here before him to demand it   serina ah papa i see you know better how to manage than we do   mr calv the loser will think it worth while to make every enquiry after so valuable an article so we must wait   eustace but if they should not think of doing so   serina we thought of doing so for diana certainly others will for a diamond   mr calv meanwhile i shall take care of it and do you be cautious not to speak of it to any body   scene iii eustace serina eustace it is very stupid for all that not to be able to talk when one has any thing so agreeable to tell i should have been so happy to show every body my ring   serina and why since you neither can nor would keep it there is no great merit in finding any thing valuable in the street   eustace that is true but what i tell you is very true too   serina people say of the ladies that they cannot keep a secret let us see which of us two will be most discreet   eustace for fear my secret should want to escape i will think of nothing but diana and now i will go to the printingoffice with the advertisement   serina go brother do not lose a moment but what does lionel want with us   scene iv serina eustace lionel lionel to eustace who is going out where are you going eustace   eustace i have something particular to do   lionel oh before you go you must liften to a story that i have to tell you it will make you die with laughing ha ha ha ha   eustace i have not time for laughing now   lionel you will laugh in spite of yourself only listen we have got full satisfaction   eustace full satisfaction of whom   lionel of rufus he has lost his fathers ring ha ha ha ha eustace and serina look at each other with an air of surprise   serina his fathers ring   lionel it is fact he had it given to him this morning to take to the jewellers to have the middle diamond set in again that had fallen out eustace jogs serina she makes a sign to him to be silent he had it when he came here but as he went away quite flustered with anger the case of the ring must have dropped out of his pocket as he whisked along   serina and have you seen him since he lost it how does he look   lionel frightened out of his wits   serina does his father know it   lionel there he has drawn himself into a fresh scrape by telling a great fib when his father asked him if he had given the ring to the jeweller he answered with the greatest assurance that he had   scrina unhappy creature   lionel why you pity him do you   eustace indeed he is to be pitied   lionel he i wish you had seen what game i made of him   serina what did you find so comical in all that   lionel how dont you take the jest to see him running from shop to shop inquiring about his ring and plucking every one by the skirt that passed i stuck close to him to enjoy his distress and at last he came up to me have not you found it have you heard nothing of it what is it to me said i to him am i your ringkeeper  if you knew what it was worth so much the better for him that has found it and then my father what will he say why he will talk to you with a good stick   serina fie master lionel that was very cruel of you   lionel he had not more feeling for you   eustace should we be illnatured then even toward those that are so themselves   lionel oh revenge is sweet and i never have any compassion for them that offend me if i had the good luck to find his ring he should not have it so soon   serina would you keep it then   lionel oh no i would give it to him after his father had threshed him well   eustace i should never have thought you so illnatured lionel   serina and i cannot believe it though i hear it from his own mouth you were so much concerned about my poor greyhound it seems it was not in earnest   lionel it was from the bottom of my heart i love those dearly that i do love but when i hate any one i hate him heartily   scene v serina eustace lionel rufus lionel heh there he comes points at him with his finger ha ha ha ha   rufus oh pray now forgive me i have been very bad to be sure but i have been full as unfortunate i am punished now and well punished too for    lionel have you stuck up handbills concerning your ring   rufus i dare not appear before my father and i dont know where to hide myself   lionel i would lay a wager that the ring is hanging at dianas tail we shall find them both together   rufus i have deserved your jeers but for pitys sake    eustace make yourself easy master rufus your ring is here   rufus astonished what have you it you my ring   lionel aside to serina he is making game of him that is right   rufus but is it really so oh on my knees i will  but no  you shall first hear how wicked i have been   scene vi serina eustace lionel serina what is the meaning of that he is gone off   eustace i am afraid the poor boy has lost his wits   lionel your joke for all that may cost you dear if he goes and fetches his father to demand the ring   eustace do you think then that i will keep it   lionel why have you actually the ring   eustace certainly i have it otherwise i should not have said so i picked it up close by our door   lionel indeed you are too good he does not deserve to be so happy you should have left him a little longer in pain at least   serina how master lionel does not my brothers example move you do you know that you lose ground now very much in his friendship and mine   scene vii mr calvert serina eustace liovel mr calv what is the matter with rufus i saw him from my window come in here all in tears   serina the poor boy was half dead   eustace it was he who lost the ring that i found it belongs to his father   mr calv have you convinced him of the meanness of his behavior toward us   lionel dear sir no diana has not been so much as mentioned   mr calv at least i would have insisted upon his returning her he should not hear of his ring without that   eustace ah papa my heart would not let me be so harsh i saw rufus so afflicted   serina though i love diana very well i could not possibly think of her just then nor of any thing but the grief of that unfortunate boy   mr calv you have both acted generously and you are my dear children my best friends all my joy and all my pride none but base souls would insult the distress of an enemy that is fallen but where is rufus why did not he ask for the ring as he went away   eustace he was so transported with joy that he did not know what he was doing   serina he ran toward the door and went out as if he were mad   eustace o papa did you but know how overjoyed i am to see you approve my behavior and my sisters   mr calv could you believe me insensible to a generous action   eustace because you had forbidden me    mr calv i forbad you to speak unguardedly about the ring but i did not tell you to keep it when the owner should appear   scene viii mr calvert serina eustace lionel rufus having the greyhound under his arm serina with an exclamation of joy ah diana my dear diana she runs to her takes her up in her arms and caresses her   rufus you see how much i was to blame and how little i deserved your generosity can you pardon me this fraud and my unworthy behavior perceiving mr calvert ah sir how bad i must appear in your eyes   mr calv a person is no longer so when he acknowledges his fault and endeavors as you do to repair it here is your fathers ring   rufus i am ashamed and sorry to have offended so excellent children what difference between them and me how wicked i am and how generous are they   serina it is only a little prank of yours master rufus and you would not have let the day pass without returning diana to me   rufus you think too well of me i had hid her up in the garret and    mr calv we dont wish to know any more it is sufficient that you are sorry for what you have done you now see yourself that bad actions make god and man our enemies and are always discovered sooner or later i should take the liberty too of proposing to you as a model the behavior of my children generous little creatures how should i thank heaven for sending me such a gif you see the most noble and certain revenge is that of doing kindnesses and that nothing is more worthy a great spirit than to repay ill nature with good offices   rufus ah i feel that now myself with the most lively sorrow to eustace and serina will you ever forgive me   eustace taking his hand yes from this moment and sincerely   serina i have my diana once more and all is forgot   rufus to lionel we should be unworthy of this pattern if we did not follow it   lionel i am as much ashamed as you and this lesson shall not be lost on me   rufus i have just confessed all to my father in proportion as he was angry with me he was touched with your generosity he requests permission to come in about an hour hence to thank you and to beg your acceptance of a small token of his gratitude   mr calv no there is no occasion for any presents to do well my children desire no reward but from themselves besides restoring a person his property is no more than a strict duty   eustace how pleasing to perform that duty i have gained a friend for my whole life have not i rufus   rufus if i could be worthy of that honor i shall do every thing in my power to be so   lionel do not exclude me from your friendship i was no better than rufus but i have just now felt how noble a passion revenge may be made   serina caressing the greyhound ah little runaway this will teach you another time to stray from your masters you have passed a night in prison for it offer to do so again and you will see  well what would be the consequence ah no whatever you do i find i shall always be fond of you   the hen how happy was cyprian in so worthy and affectionate a father as mr tisdall whenever he had shown himself for any length of time discreet and diligent he was assured that his father would not fail to testify his satisfaction with some recompense or other cyprian had a taste for gardening and began about the age of twelve to cultivate choice flowers his father saw it and immediately began to study how he might afford his son more pleasure  they were both at dinner cyprian said his father your preceptor has informed me that you have begun this very day to read the roman history and the geography of italy if in a week you can but give me an exact account of every thing you may have learned on these two subjects you cannot think what i intend shall recompense your application  cyprian one may easily suppose did not forget such a promise he employed himself in studying all the week to get this recompense or rather he received such pleasure from his study that indeed it was he who should have bestowed a recompense on his papa if he had been able  he saw the day of trial come without anxiety and underwent the examination like an hero he had learned the history of all the kings of rome and marked out in his map the gradual progress of that growing empire  in a transport of delight his father took him by the hand embraced and kissed him come says he since you have sought to give me so much pleasure it is but just that i should contribute in my turn to yours saying this he led him into an adjoining garden pointed out a vacant spot to him and told him that it was to be his you may part it in two continued he and plant what flowers you like in one and any vegetables that you think proper in the other after this they went into an outhouse close behind the gardeners hut where cyprian found a spade a wateringpot a rake and other implements of gardening all perfectly adapted to his size and strength on the walls were baskets hung up of every size great and small and on shelves about them sundry boxes full of roots and bags of seeds the whole together duly ticketed with cards on every box and bag marking the proper time for sowing each article  one should be of cyprians age to know the excess of his joy upon this occasion in his mind the little spot of earth which his father had assigned him was as great as monarchs think their kingdoms and whatever hours of relaxation his preceptor let him take and which he spent before in folly were now taken up in cultivating his domain  one day when he came in from doing something about his garden he forgot to shut the gate a hen was pecking near the spot and took it in her head to go a hunting on his grounds the flowerbed had been strewed but lately with a layer of the richest mould and was consequently quite full of worms  the hen charmed with such delicious fare began to scratch the mould up and employ her beak as well as talons to unearth the worms and in particular she took a mighty inclination to a part where cyprian had the day before been planting some fine pinks  how great therefore was the excess of his rage when coming back to his plantation he beheld the door a jar and this newfashioned gardener digging up his beds ah ah you impudent slut said he your bones shall pay for this and immediately he shut the door for fear his victim should escape and picking up flint stones sand clods of earth and whatever he could lay hold of he threw them at the bird pursuing her all the while as close as he could  the frightened hen at one time ran with all her speed and at another time strove to fly upon the wall but found that her wings would not befriend her in reaching such a height unhappily she fell back more than once on cyprians flowers and got her wings and feet entangled with the finest hyacinths  young cyprian beholding her thus embroiled supposed that he had her fast two rows of tulips separated them his anger was so vehement that stepping over as he meant to do this interval of separation between the hen and him he trod them down himself the hen however at her enemys approach redoubled her former efforts and attempted now a second time to gain the wall she rose a great deal higher than before yet still came short but what was matter of regret for cyprian bore away with her from underneath as she rose a beautiful rosebudcoloured tenbelled hyacinth on this he seized his rake and flung it at the bird with all his strength the rake turned round and while he fancied it upon the point of hitting the fugitive mark it came down and dashed two panes of glass to pieces in a melon frame as well as broke out two of its own teeth upon the ground  the little fury made much more furious by these damages had run for his spade and now the combat would perhaps have had fatal consequences for his feathered adversary who fatigued and giddy had crept in between a rosebush and the wall if mr tisdall at first attracted to his window by the noise had not made haste to her assistance  the moment cyprian saw his father he stood stock still in evident confusion however he made shift to find his tongue at last and cried out see papa what ravage this vile creature has committed in my garden  had you shut the door replied his father with an affected indifference this ravage would not have been made i saw your whole behavior are you not ashamed of having put forth all your strength against a harmless hen she has no reason to conduct herself and though she has rooted up your pinks it was not with a wish to do you any damage but to get her ordinary food now cyprian should you have put yourself thus into a passion if she had scratched up nothing but as many nettle roots and how can she distinguish between pinks and nettles it is yourself alone that are to blame for all this havoc with precaution you would certainly have driven her out so that she might do no further mischief and in that case neither your rake nor my melon frame would have gone to ruin or your loss have exceeded that of a few flowers therefore you alone are punishable so that were i to cut a branch off from this hazletree and with it make you suffer just what you designed the hen should suffer  which of us would act with the greatest justice i shall not however go to this extremity purposely to show you that we may all suppress our resentment if we think proper notwithstanding for the damage done to my melon frame i shall deduct as much as will repair it from the arrears of your allowance in my hands for i am not to suffer through your rashness  cyprian upon this withdrew much abashed and all day durst scarcely lift his eyes up while before his father  on the morrow mr tisdall proposed a walk and asked if he desired to join him cyprian followed but oppressed with sadness which he sought in vain to hide his father saw it and affecting a degree of wonder wished to know why he appeared so grievously dejected  cyprian have i not the greatest cause to be dejected for this whole month past i have denied myself so many pleasures merely to buy something for my sister i had saved ten shillings with which i thought to purchase her a pretty hat but must give the half of it perhaps to have your melon frame repaired   mr tisdall i dare say you would have been delighted to oblige your sister but my melon frame however must be paid for first this lesson will teach you in future not to yield yourself up to the mischiefs of resentment which in general aggravates the first misfortune happening to us   cyprian ah you may depend upon it sir i will never leave the gardendoor open again or take revenge upon a hen for what would be my own omission   mr tisdall but pray tell me do you fancy that in this vast universe hens only have it in their power to do you damage   cyprian o no no for look ye not above a week ago i left my map upon the table while i went a walking and my little sister coming into the room with a pen and ink so blotted it all over that no one could distinguish europe from america   mr tisdall then it is prudent to secure yourself against the mischiefs that you may suffer from your fellow creatures   cyprian it is so papa   mr tisdall without desiring in the least to give you a distaste of life i can assure you that you will have to suffer many disagreeable affairs and those a deal more prejudicial to you than the mischiefs caused by the hen mankind always seek their interest and their pleasures just as hens seek worms and they will do so at the hazard of your interests as hens will at the hazard of your flowers   cyprian i see it plainly sir by bellas behavior since the little pleasure that she received from scribbling on a bit of paper has occasioned me the loss of an extremely useful map   mr tisdall but could you not have avoided this loss by putting up your map before you left the apartment   cyprian certainly   mr tisdall then think for the future to conduct yourself so that no body may have power to do you any real mischief but if after all in spite of your precaution you should be so unlucky as to receive an injury consider how you may endure it so as not to render the first wrong still more prejudicial   cyprian ay papa but how must i endure it   mr tisdall with indifference if it be a slight injury but on the other hand if a great one with courage now that we are by ourselves i dare propose you as an example the conduct that i pursue toward mr hotham   cyprian pray dont speak of him papa these two years past he takes no notice of you whenever you meet each other and there cannot be a falsity that he will not say to prejudice you in the opinion of the world   mr tisdall and do you know what urges him to such behavior   cyprian that i never yet durst ask you   mr tisdall nothing but for the preference which i obtained respecting an employ that my father had so worthily filled up for five and thirty years and to which he had affectionately formed me by the most diligent instruction mr hotham had no title to the post except his ignorance and selfsufficiency my right succeeded notwithstanding all his interest and therefore am i honored with his calumny and hatred   cyprian ah papa were i as big as you i would teach him better manners   mr tisdall quite the contrary i let him go on railing at me just as he thinks fit the conduct which you should have pursued when you were injured by the hen i faithfully pursue toward him the pinks that she scratched up by the roots in seeking for worms may represent the reputable character that i bear and which in order to gratify the worm of envy that gnaws him he labors to undo were i to seek the means of punishing him i should trample under foot that deference and respect which i owe to myself as you trod under foot your tulips the meon frame and rake which you damaged are that wealth and peace of mind that i should destroy by hurrying on to vengeance taught in future by the losses that you have suffered you will shut the garden door in order to keep the hen out taught too by the wicked disposition of my enemy i lay by means of proper conduct on my part an insuperable barrier between us thus inaccessible to his vindictive attempts i enjoy the comforts of my moderation while he spends himself in those attempts and will in time experience the compunction of his evil conscience could his insults vex me i should make myself the victim that he would sacrifice and be reproached for imbecility by every worthy character of my acquaintance while on the other hand the insensibility that i manifest for his injurious treatment yields him to his own contempt and in the bosom of good men keeps up the reputation that i have gained among them   cyprian ah papa what trouble may i not shun hereafter by remembering every thing that you have taught me  these last words were hardly uttered when they found themselves at home without imagining that they had been so near it their discourse for the remainder of the day was a continuation of the past and bedtime being come they separated quite content with one another cyprian sunk to slumber with a bosom full of gratitude for the instruct on which he had just received and mr tisdall with one possessing all the satisfaction that a good father cannot but experience who is sensible that he has done something to promote his offsprings happiness   the little needlewomen characters mrs vincent her daughters louisa her daughters leonora her daughters sophy her daughters clara their friend a poor woman madge her daughters joan her daughters louisa with leonora her sister are discovered working in their room sophy stands by louisa clara enters to them  clara hard at work how melancholy you all look i thought

yourselves a deal of trouble   louisa how you talk as if our clothes were fit for such small children   clara that i know they would have been too big and dragged upon the ground at least a quarter of a yard but then their mother might have made them less herself   louisa she cannot   clara and why not   leonora looking steadfastly upon clara because her parents never taught her how to use her needle   louisa now as we are rather ready at it we desired mama to let us have some dimity and other stuff and to out us out the necessary patterns promising to do the rest ourselves   leonora and when the whole is finished we shall visit the poor woman with it that her children may be dressed a little warmly this cold weather   louisa now my dear you know the reason why we will not go play

see see how she sets about it    louisa ah that is all my fault who did not tell her how it should be done  see here my dear clara  in this manner   clara i was never taught to do so much as you and that is the reason that i am so awkward   leonora with a sneer oh i easily believe you   louisa but do not vex her sister she has done her best hold let me look a little how you have passed the bobbin through already look ye leonora   leonora pulling the bobbin what a pity it will not stir a mighty clever needlewoman truly she does nothing else but make us work   clara sorrowfully alas i know no

interim i will have a little conversation with the mother and contrive how she may find out some employment for the time to come and earn a little money she goes out with sophy   le stay you here with

say you   leonora a comb however to untangle it would not be much amiss i will do that louisa   sophy runs in jumping here is mama mrs vinrent enters with the mother of the children   the mother oh heavens what do i see are these my children o my generous lady falling down at mrs vincents feet   mrs vincent lifting her up my good friend it is not to me that you are indebted for this happiness my children wished to make a trial of their skill in needle work and i permitted them to do so examining the childrens jackets not so bad considering a first essay you might almost set up for yourselves   the mother to louisa and her sister my charming ladies let me thank you god will recompense your kindness for i cannot perceiving clara at a distance pardon me my little lady i did not see you otherwise i should have paid you also my acknowledgments   clara sighing no no i had no hand in this days business   mrs vincent do not afflict yourself upon that account my dear by sighing you will get nothing but by steadfastly resolving every thing however tell me do not you think it useful and delightful for a young lady like you to accustom herself betimes to work of some sort or other   clara think so certainly   mrs vincent of what real pleasure even at present are you not deprived by having hitherto neglected an employment so adapted to your sex and age   the mother dear little lady learn betimes if you would be considered provident or prudent to love work or it will soon be too late i should be very happy now had any one but given me such a lesson in my childhood i could now have got my brad and been of use to those dependant on me for support instead of being burdensome to worthy people   mrs vincent truly my good friend it would have been much happier for you i must own although i should have lost the pleasure of assisting you but you are yet full young enough to make up for lost time by application to some honest labor children you must know i have procured her some employment at a weavers in the neighborhood and when she happens to have nothing to do there she is to come and work here in the garden   sophy i am very glad of that for i will go too and help her if i am able   mrs vincent with respect to madge and joan i mean that my house shall be their school and you have both to louisa and leonora deserved to be their mistresses in work and reading   clara and may i be their assistant madam   mrs vincent with all my heart if your mama consents in which case you and sophy shall endeavor to outdo each other to the poor woman my good friend are you contented that matters should be as i have settled   the mother contented my benevolent and generous lady i shall owe you all my happiness and that too of my destitute and friendless children dear good angels give god thanks for having blessed you with so careful a mamma who trains you up thus betimes to diligence you see it is the source of comfort to yourselves and to us too   omitted here the love of god and of our parents a piece that indeed will not well bear to be translated into english  the veteran dismissed with honor a drama in one act characters lord cornwallis an offier attending him captain and mrs greville dougas their children uoenia their children mary anne their children the scene is at the entrance of a grove before the house of captain greville somewhat distant from the road  scene i duglas and eugenia eugenia is discovered sitting on a trunk and picking strawberries beside her lies her straw bat to hold the strawberries when picked douglas brings her more in his both bats are neatly lined with leaves  douglas look ye sister we shall quickly have enough   eugenia i do not know douglas how i shall dispose of mine my hat is too full already   douglas mary anne cannot be long before she brings the bushel and indeed she might have gone into the house found one and returned in much less time than this however in the interval eugenia put them in your apron   eugenia yes yes that would make fine work indeed to spot it all from top to bottom what do you suppose mama would say and therefore i have thought of something else your hat is biggest so i will add my strawberries to yours and you shall go and gather more while i am picking these   douglas well said indeed and in the interim mary anne cannot fail to come and then we shall have got enough   eugenia when they are all together we shall see   douglas what is over when the baskets are filled we will take ourselves   eugenia i think we shall not have much appetite to taste them afterward ah brother it is the last time that we shall eat with our papa this year and who can tell whether we shall ever see him more   douglas oh do not be dejected sister every one is not killed in a battle   eugenia oh frightful war if men were not so wicked but would love each other just as we do    douglas mighty fine indeed and do not we quarrel every day for trifles we each think ourselves in the right and frequently it would puzzle any one to find which is it is just the same among grown men   eugenia they ought at least then to be friends again as soon as we are our worst quarrels never come to bloodshed   douglas no because our parents settle them but men eugenia are not children and will not let themselves be governed if they have but arms and in fact is it right that we should suffer any one to injure us without resisting   eugenia you are always talking like a soldier   douglas a good reason why because i am to be one look ye sister notwithstanding any thing that you say against it war is a very charming thing without it how do you imagine that we should live would our papas little fortune be sufficient to support us but do not weep you grieve me   eugenia let me weep dear brother while we are alone i had much rather do so here than in the presence of papa for i know it would afflict him   douglas come come dry your eyes and set to work for some amusement i will go and fill your hat   eugenia go that way we have left none hereabouts douglas goes out and after a moments silence she goes on i would i were but learned enough that i might pray to god for he would hear me or at least if i were big enough i would go to court and fall before the king and he i am sure would grant me my papas dismission when i begged and prayed him to oblige me he has served his country long enough i think she sets about picking her strawberries again   scene ii eugenia lord cornwallis the officer lord c whispering the officer yonder is the house where we were told captain greville lives he will be very much surprised and pleased with what i bring him a dismission from the service with such honor but what charming little girl is this i will stop and have a little conversation with her so do not you address me by my name to eugenia tapping her upon the shoulder why you are very hard at work i see my pretty child   eugenia oh sir you frightened me   lord c i ask your pardon then my dear i did not mean to do so and for whom are you preparing all these strawberries they cannot but be very fine i think as they are picked by such a plump and snowy hand   eugenia holding out the hat i beg then you will take some sir do not be afraid for they are very clean i only wish i had a better plate to put them into lord c takes two or three as does the officer   lord c i never tasted any better do you sell them little dear   eugenia no sir though you were to give me  i cannot tell how much   lord c you are in the right they are above all value being gathered by so sweet a little hand   eugenia fie sir how you talk no it is not for that they should be at your service were they not intended for wiping her eyes my dear papa we have not gathered any for m yet this season and perhaps these are to be the last that he will taste   lord c what my dear he is ill then and you think that he will die   the officer his illness however it is to be hoped is not yet quite desperate since he thinks of eating strawberries   eugenia no not that it is true indeed he has been troubled with the rheumatism all last winter to a very great degree and is not yet quite cured but cured or not he must set out tomorrow   lord c and pray why is his departure then so needful   eugenia oh because his regiment then goes through the village and he must join it on the march   lord c his regiment   eugenia yes my lord cornwalliss that is going to america   lord c aside to the officer i would lay you any wager this is one of captain grevilles children   eugenia overhearing him yes that is my papas name  do you know him   lord c know him why the gentleman and i are both his comrades   eugenia what and is the regiment so near then  will it go through the town today   lord c no not till tomorrow we are come my dear before it and  and  aside to the officer what excuse can i invent to serve my purpose  and a wheel belonging to our carriage being broke hard by we thought to get a little shade here while it was mending and now every thing i fancy must be set to rights this path i take it leads directly to the road again   eugenia no sir it takes you to the village   lord c and the village i suppose belongs to your papa   eugenia belongs to him i wish indeed he were so rich he has nothing but a little cottage with a garden this small grove and yonder meadow when he is not at the regiment he passes all his time here with us   lord c he was ill then in the winter   eugenia yes indeed sir to our sorrow and he could not move a limb besides a wound which he received many years ago below the temple has broke out afresh and now that he is almost well he must be forced to go again to meet with new misfortunes   lord c in such a situation why does not he sell out he might procure sufficient attestations from the surgeon   eugenia oh mama did that in private for him but her letters never yet were answered certainly the king refuses to believe her or perhaps that lord cornwallis who commands the regiment is so cruel    lord c truly i believe my lord cornwallis would not like to lose so good an officer as your papa by whose instructions i myself and all the younger officers may learn so much   eugenia and yet you do not appear so very young but are your papa and mama still living   lord c a little disconcerted do you doubt it   eugenia oh i warrant you they cried at parting with you how could they consent to lose you i remember how much grief it caused mama and us when first my eldest brother went abroad to study and that is nothing in comparison of war   lord c i cannot tell that for i have left them after many separations in which case it is nothing to leave one another and besides when first i went to camp my father went with me   eugenia did he oh those fathers that are soldiers themselves are a little hard i can tell you but yet that is not the case with my papa he is so indulgent why a child is scarce so gentle it is upon the point of honor alone that he can never be persuaded so that after all i fancy he himself is to blame and nobody else for his remaining still in the service   lord c ay indeed how is that   eugenia because he never asked for his dismission he is ever saying people would imagine him a coward should he quit the service during war he only wishes that he may always have but strength enough to sit on horseback and then he says he will part with every drop of blood he has to serve his country well he will have his wish one time or other but we poor children then shall be without a father   lord c recollect your father has been hitherto preserved from danger and why should he not continue still as safe it is not every musket that hits   eugenia but those that do commonly kill their man and in the number may there not be one that will reach papa   lord c that is true indeed but what sweet little lady is this   eugenia my sister mary anne   scene iii eugenia lord cornwallis the officer mary anne eugenia so mary anne you are come at last i see and where have you been staying   mary anne why mama would make me help her to do up papas portmanteau   eugenia where is the basket let me have it sister   mary anne have you gathered strawberries enough to fill it   eugenia you shall see emptying the hat your pardon gentlemen   lord c oh do not mind us whispering the officer what lovely children   mary anne whispering eugenia who may these be   eugenia whispering mary anne officers in lord cornwalliss regiment   mary anne do they come to fetch papa   eugenia no no they are before the regiment which will not go through the village till tomorrow as papa expected   mary anne ah would all the officers together with the regiment were at jericho   eugenia speak lower mary anne if the gentlemen should hear you   mary anne let them hear me if they like it what they come to take away papa and shall not we have leave to make complaint   lord c whispering the officer methinks we are not looked upon very favorably here   the officer then my lord why do not you discover yourself and mention the good news that you bring their father   lord c no their openness delights me and the affection that they evince in favor of their parents ravishes my heart   eugenia to mary anne poor douglas is hard at work while we are chattering here without once thinking of him i will go and help him mary anne stay you here and take care how you speak before these gentlemen   mary anne go go i know what is proper   eugenia this is my sister mary anne i present her to you gentlemen   mary anne with a little frowardness your servant gentlemen   lord c she has a countenance as resolute as yours is timid   eugenia she will stay here to entertain you gentlemen for i must run and help my brother to gather strawberries so that all of us may go back the sooner to papa will you permit me to inform him of your visit  he will be very happy to receive you   mary anne no he will not be very happy to receive you nor we neither we should rather be pleased were we left alone at present   eugenia i hope your kindness will excuse this little madcap   mary anne oh yes to be sure excuse me why these gentlemen are sensible that little girls when strangers are at table must not speak a word and i have twenty thousand things to tell papa at parting which will otherwise go near to break my heart   lord c dear children do not fear any thing you shall not be disturbed by us in your delightful conversation eugenia makes a grateful curtsy and withdraws   mary anne but pray tell me gentlemen what reason has the king for thus taking away a good papa from us poor children does he think that we do not want one to bring us up   lord c no no but then do you think that he does not want good soldiers to go abroad and fight   mary anne and what necessity for fighting or suppose that there should be any surely our papa in staying at home to give his children a good education would not be useless to his country   lord c no indeed especially my pretty mary anne if his other little ones improve as much as you do   mary anne i believe you jest i know that i am thought a little forward in the family and i have heard it said that if i had but a cockade i could not fail to make a tolerable soldier   lord c ha ha ha a little amazon you would become a perfect hero   mary anne i can tell you if i had only a sword i would not be laughed at   lord c nay if that be all here is mine i will arm you with it   mary anne do i should be very glad   lord c presenting the sword and stooping to salute her this is the first ceremony   mary anne keeping him off softly softly i beseech you sir   lord c attempting it again oh you are a charming child   mary anne running from him brother sister   lord c mighty well miss soldier you are afraid of me then i see   mary anne i afraid of you oh no but do not however come too near or i shall run and fetch papa papa is an officer as well as you are and will not suffer any one to hurt his little mary anne   lord c heaven forbid that i should design to hurt you it was only done in joke   scene iv lord cornwallis the officer mary anne eugenia douglas douglas coming boldly forward you cried out just now mary anne i am come to your assistance   lord c against us my little friend   douglas against any one that hurts my sister   mary anne thank you brother but i did not mean to cry out quite so loud and have no need of your assistance for you see i have disarmed one however sir returning lord c his sword for this once i grant you quarter but do not come too near in future i believe you understand me   lord c why i vow you are an extraordinary little creature   eugenia i am charmed to hear you talk so but gentlemen at last we have gathered strawberries enough to share some with you presenting them the bushel take a sew let me request you   lord c no indeed we do not intend to touch them they have a destination more respectable than that we should think of making free with any   eugenia those that you take will all be from our share and there will be no harm done should we go without you are in papas own regiment and it is sitting that we should treat you with as much respect as we are able   mary anne taking a nosegay from her bosom and presenting it to lord c ah on that account i will beg you to accept this nosegay i had gathered it for myself papa and mama already have had one apiece or i could not have given you this but it belongs to me sir and i give it you   lord c and i my little dear accept it with the greatest pleasure   mary anne it is somewhat faded by the sun but if you will stay a little i will go gather you some jasmin violets and jonquils in my garden   eugenia mary anne you remember i suppose the rosebush just before my window you may gather all the roses that are blown upon it   mary anne well sir shall i   lord c would you have that kindness my dear child but no i thank you for the pleasure of conversing with you entertains me more than all the roses in the universe   mary anne a thought strikes me possibly you know what way an officer should take to quit the service honorably could you not afford us some good counsel to procure papas dismission   eugenia if you could we should be very glad to give you every thing in our power   douglas who has hitherto amused himself by playing with the hilt of lord cs sword and looking at his uniform o yes if you could only tell us how to keep papa at home my drum spontoon cartouch box and accoutrements should all be yours   mary anne with a smile and i will give you freey what you sought just now to take by force   lord c so many charming things at once believe me if i did but know    eugenia sorrowful you did but know so then we only make things worse and grieve you that you cannot be of service to us   mary anne oh i do not give up so soon my lord cornwallis colonel of the regiment will very soon pass this way well then we three will go and throw ourselves before him hang upon his clothes and not let him go until he has granted our desire   eugenia yes sister he shall see our tears and we will tell him how extremely ill papa was all the winter how indifferent he is at present and how much we should lament his going from us do you think sir he would be so cruel as to send us from him and not grant us our request   lord c i cannot think that of him my good friends but if he be not come already on his way thus far there is room to fear that he will delay his setting out from london longer and you know in that case you would lose your pains as your papa must march tomorrow happily however there is a gentleman his friend who can do every thing as if he were my lord himself and he is at present with the regiment serving as a volunteer   douglas a volunteer   lord c yes so they call it one whose wish is to acquire a knowledge of the art of war assisted by my lords instruction i can answer for it he will grant whatever your papa may wish for   eugenia and is he your friend   lord c yes truly   eugenia then for heavens sake sir speak to him in papas behalf that he may not be parted from his family who live but by his means and if he must leave england do you soften if you can his service and at any time should he be sick or wounded    mary anne wounded do not wait sir till he is wounded but if a sabre should be raised against him run you in and save him from the blow   lord c aside how difficult i find it to keep still concealed  no generous little souls fear nothing i will be answerable for his safety with my life   eugenia we may rely upon you then how much you charm us sir yet do not upon that account forget to speak about him to the volunteer that you just now mentioned  i could talk still to you on this subject but your heart will tell you every thing that i have left unsaid and our papa whom we shall lose tomorrow must be waiting for us   lord c go dear children but first take some trifle from me as a recompense for the agreeable halfhour that i have spent in conversation with you here my sweet eugenia take this ring it is a little too big but may soon be fitted to your finger   eugenia refusing the ring no no sir mama perhaps would be displeased and so too would papa whose least reproach i would not deserve for the world particularly as he must leave us tomorrow   lord c you must absolutely take it should he be displeased i will undertake to reconcile you with him when he joins the regiment if i cannot by my speaking to the volunteer prevent his leaving england   eugenia taking it well then he shall bring it you in that case and if otherwise i shall be very happy to remember you as often as i look upon it   mary anne come come sister it is high time that we should be gone   lord c and you my lovely mary anne i suppose would not be sorry to remember me see here is a copper etric gilt and at the top a composition stone they call it a false diamond   mary anne looking at it yes i understand you but there is nothing false about it except your words it is gold i am certain and a real diamond i will not have it you have been a plundering for it my papa is a captain sir as well as you but cannot make such presents for he never went a plundering in his life   lord c take take it there is no plundering in the case it would be useless to me in the field and therefore if you will not have it as a present keep it for me till such time as i return   mary anne o that i will with all my heart   lord c and now perhaps you have a kiss to give me for security   mary anne no no i have told you the conditions   lord c well then i will do what i can to obtain them   mary anne and i will keep the you know what sir till that time  come brother   douglas go you first i shall follow you immediately i have something to say in private to the gentleman   lord c i will speak with you this moment   the officer who some little time before had withdrawn returns and gives my lord a pocketbook they whisper one another mary anne whispering douglas what and should you like a present too   eugenia in a whisper likewise fie fie brother i should never have suspected you of so much meanness   douglas and fie you too sisters that can entertain so mean a notion of your brother i have something very different and much more important also that i should like to ask   mary anne well now if i were in a merry mood i could not but burst out a laughing at the gravity with which you speak of your important something   douglas ay and were you not my sister i would make you squeak miss saucebox for suspecting me   mary anne going out with eugenia well manage your important something properly   scene v lord cornwallis the officer douglas lord c i am glad dear douglas that you desire to stay we were not quite acquainted but at present and particularly as my friend here tells me that my chaise is not set to rights yet we shall have some more minutes to stand talking with each other   douglas so we shall but do not imagine that i remain here to get something from you   lord c how   douglas because you gave my sisters each a present you might fancy that i want one but i protest sir i shall not take any thing   lord c unluckily for me too i have nothing i can offer you   douglas unluckily i am glad that you have not for now neither can be tempted   lord c aside to the officer i am charmed with his disinterestedness and never saw a lovelier figure   douglas i have but one question sir to ask you   lord c and what is that my friend   douglas you told my sister such a gentleman was with the army as a volunteer pray what is a volunteer   lord c a volunteer is a soldier who may fight or not fight as he chooses   douglas oh if i were to turn soldier it should be to fight and i would gladly be a volunteer on that condition   lord c but a volunteer must have a deal of money have you   douglas no but then the king has and pray is not he obliged to keep his soldiers   lord c no for as a volunteer is not obliged to fight it is but just that he should subsist himself   douglas i am sorry to hear this but if i wanted only bread and water or should beg the regiment to receive me sir instead of my papa  what then   lord c poor child and what sort of a figure would you cut before a company  you ought to have experience and authority   douglas if i have not enough of either to command i must have surely to obey let me be any thing provided i may serve   lord c would you be barely capable of following in the march   douglas i will go as far as i am able and when tired let me be lifted up among the baggage or i will ride upon the cannon are you fearful that i should lag behind   lord c but if you were to serve instead of your para you do not remember that you must part with him as much as if he went himself   douglas and do not you think that i should rejoice to be the means of keeping him at home here with mama and sisters you would hardly lose by such a change unhappily my dear papa will not be able to serve long and i shall very soon be what he was i love a soldiers business at my heart i know a number of marches and can play them on my fife look here is a book of songs it is called the grenadiers delight i will give it you i know the whole by heart   lord c aside to the officer i have a thought to douglas i would not wish better present and in turn i will give you not indeed a book of songs my little douglas but a single son   douglas a song indeed i may accept   lord c feeling in his pocket hold here is in the first place one that you will give your father   douglas oh he never sings sir now and likes no music but the cannons   lord c that does not signify i am sure you will both be pleased with this  if you do but read it and here taking a paper out of his pocketbook is one for you   douglas jumping for joy oh thank you let me see now if i know it   lord c no no douglas you shall read them after we have left you he puts the two papers together and thrusts them into douglass pocket let me put them in your pocket and do you take care not to lose either  now farewell my little friend and since you love a soldiers life i will have you for my comrade   douglas jumping up into his arms yes i will be so i will always love you and the first engagement that i enter i will be all the while at your side   the officer we will go and let the regiment know that you are coming   douglas do and pray sir give me a good word   lord c retiring with the officer i feel how much the fathers heart must bleed to quit such lovely children and rejoice on that account to be the bearer of such welcome tidings as the paper now in douglass pocket will inform him of let us withdraw a little to some corner where we may unseen remark him they get among the trees and douglas has his eye upon them till they are out of sight   douglas alone and sitting for a little while profoundly thoughtful on the trunk then getting up and walking to and fro why should they desire to set papa a singing taking out the papers ha this paper is sealed  there is something fur in it i suppose so let me see my own opening it is this a song it does not look like one the words go after one another all along the line reading i promise to pay to mr abraham newland or bearer on demand the sum of fifty pounds i do not know any tune that will suit these words reading again london december        for the governor and company of the bank of england john larkin  he meant to make a fool of me i fancy when he called this a song it is all concerning money  ho captain captain going out after them   scene vi douglas capt greville pale and feeble mrs greville mary anne eugenia capt greville where where is he perceiving douglas douglas where is my lord   douglas looking about him my lord i have not seen the least bit of a lord not i   mary anne that handsome gentleman that talked with us   eugenia he that gave me this fine ring papa says no one but a lord could make so rich a present   douglas vexed blockhead that i was not to discover him   eugenia oh what a fine fine gentleman   mary anne so good and so familiar oh my sweet etui i will keep you all my lifetime now   capt greville how long has he been gone   douglas this moment i was running after him   capt greville tomorrow fortunately i shall join his lordship for it must be lord cornwallis it is his cipher that is engraved on the etui and i can tell him then how much my children are obliged to his benevolence i am sorry however that i had not an opportunity of asking him to lodge for one night with us should you not have been rejoiced to entertain him children   douglas oh yes yes papa he called me comrade when he took his leave   mary anne for my part though i like him yet i am glad that he is gone for had he staid we should not have been able then to talk as if we loved you   capt greville mary anne is in the right i should not have been free to mix my tears with yours dear children in his presence   mrs greville and on that account i could wish to have had his company the violence that you must have done your sorrows would in that case have enabled me to keep down mine and since tomorrow we must lose you    eugenia oh do not speak of that mama   capt greville dear children possibly i shall not leave you long peace cannot be far off it is the wish of every one in england and no sooner shall that wish be gratified but i will instantly come back and never part with you again   mrs greville but yet till things are settled you must unavoidably be from us and what comfort shall we have as long as you are absent   eugenia with what pleasure would i give him back his ring if he would leave you with us   mary anne and i likewise his etui   douglas and i too his newfashioned song see see papa what he has put into my hand here was there ever such a song before   capt greville let us see having read a little what bounty is in this nobleman and what a charming way he has of obliging he has given you here an order for receiving a whole pocketfull of gold   douglas what has he tricked me when you see him give him back his money i will not have it but there is something else and he has given me likewise here a song for you   capt greville a song for me my little fellow you are dreaming   douglas drawing the sealed paper out of his pocket no no here it is   the children smiling at each other and approaching their father with looks of curiosity a song a song   capt greville good heavens what is this  the kings coat of arms he opens the packet with a trembling hand and looking at the signature cries out and signet then casting his eyes over the three or four first lines breaks forth again is it possible  dear wife and little ones  rejoice rejoice   mrs greville if you stay with us   capt greville let me read the letter out they all come round him and stand silent while he reads oh unexpected joy continues reading no no it must be all a dream in which my pleased imagination forms the most brilliant chimeras  and yet stay for i am awake and every thing is real though i never could have hoped for so much happiness   all speaking at once mrs greville i am dying with impatience to know every thing   eugenia well well what is it dear papa   mary anne you keep us all in pain   douglas let me see your song   capt greville embracing his wife and children i am to stay with you my life  we are not to be separated my  children  giving mrs greville the letter yes yes read yourself   mrs greville i tremble every limb and cannot    unable to contain themselves for joy our papa stays with us our papa stays with us   capt greville yes yes children i shall not go to america or leave you and yet still continue in the service in a way so honorable   mrs greville coming to herself and how how my life   capt greville the king informed but by what means i know not of my illness and touched with my situation permits my staying here in england but to recompense my services these are hs own words he confers upon me the command of upnor castle with the rank of colonel   mrs greville what my dear   eugenia joy joy   mary anne so then papa there is not a greater man in all the army   douglas and you are colonel are you   capt greville yes and for the first time in my life entirely happy but my dearest life to mrs greville shall i be pardoned when i tell you such an honor is not on account of any step that i took to get it  it has come i cannot tell how   mrs greville yes yes i know that very well i did every thing in my power though what i did was never meant for such an honor joined to so much happiness they must be both however placed to the account of my solicitation   mary anne ah the naughty man say i but that mama took greater care of us than he did   eugenia so papa then you deceived us   capt greville yes my little deary but still what could i have done i have only this excuse to offer that false modesty restrained me from requesting my dismission even though i should have thought myself unable to be of any real service to my country i was not however then quite sensible of my condition but now i feel it yes i feel within me that my constitution is no longer fit for the fatigue of arms   mrs greville and this false modesty would have been death to me and have left these innocents without a father but that providence has ordered your affairs much better every thing however now is to be pardoned all my wish is that we had here the generous nobleman who brought us this glad news that we might thank him for his kindness to our little ones and also for his message which if the truth were known i dare engage he has in some degree been instrumental in procuring for what likelihood is there that i an unknown woman should by myself have so far succeeded beyond every thing that i could ever have wished   capt greville at least if we had but been able to afford him the hospitality of one nights lodging with us   douglas let us run different ways and overtake him if we can   capt greville go go it grieves me that i cannot follow you   mary anne if we can meet with him and he will but accompany us back he shall have then instead of one three kisses   scene vii douglas capt greville mrs greville eugenia mary anne lord cornwallis the officer lord c running from his hiding place and laying hold of mary anne shall i  a match my little maid he kisses her three times   eugenia and douglas my lord my lord   mary anne a little out of countenance you have almost frightened me with your kisses   capt greville o my worthy general what words will show you half my gratitude   mrs greville how can my children and myself express our obligations to whom we are indebted for such a blessing we at present know not but your lordship is the bearer of a paper which to me restores a husband and a father to my children   lord c for this blessing you and they are debtors to the king i have done nothing but solicited his bounty wishing that i might prove the channel through which it should flow hearing accidentally dear madam of your application i determined to support it with my little interest and if possible to get more than was solicited you owe this interference to my knowledge of the captains merit being as i was convinced how much he had instructed his inferior officers and been of benefit to those above him upon this account i did not think it reasonable that he should still be forced to serve among us when his infirmity made service painful to him and still more to show how heartily i prosecuted this affair with pleasure i took advantage of our march so near his habitation to bring down myself the news of my success and glad the bosom of his spouse and children with it this believe me is a joy that i shall never forget he holds out his hand to capt greville who clasps it with transport   capt greville and is it possible that i should have met with such a generous friend who of his own accord has seconded an application which the affection of a valuable wife was making for me but without my knowledge no one who had less than your benevolence my lord could have so heartily endeavored to promote the happiness of an afflicted family   mrs greville then likewise you have made such princely presents to my children   eugenia i am now ashamed that i took this ring i did not think it to be of so much value   lord c i must own it is pretty but much more so on your charming hand it is indeed so altered i no longer know it   mary anne neither would you i suppose sir your etui and therefore i will not speak a word about it   douglas as for me i give you back your song it is not what you meant to let me have   lord c then be it a mistake and since i have already made it pardon me to which i hope your good papa will add another favor that his douglas may be made an ensign i will give order for it if he chooses   capt greville if i choose my lord you are the guardian angel sent to succor us   douglas but is it in your regiment   lord c yes my little friend   douglas ah how rejoiced i am i will go this moment with you and the name of my papa shall not so quickly be forgotten in the army   capt greville you have conferred so many favors on me  would you vouchsafe me now one more that i am about to ask   lord c i apprehend your meaning and so far from not vouchsafing beg you to bestow it namely an asylum in your house for one night for my companion and myself capt and mrs greville how respectfully provided however that miss mary anne consents   mary anne oh since my papa is to remain among us stay as long as you think proper   eugenia i may hope now my lord that you will consent to eat a few more strawberries   mary anne you will make them no less sweet to us than i imagined your arrival would have made them bitter   douglas yes my lord come in and honor my papa by eating with us and hereafter i will do every thing in my power to deserve a second honor like it  in your lordships tent   george and cecilia little george an orphan had been brought up from his infancy by ldy eustace who together with lord eustace were retired from london and resided in a small country town from the tenderness with which they treated him a stranger in the family would have imagined him to be really their son this worthy couple had but one child left them and that a girl named cecilia who was nearly of an age with george and lady eustace had the satisfaction to behold a more than common mutual sondness subsist between the children  one delightful morning toward the end of august george and cecilia with their little friend lucinda whose parents lived that summer in the neighborhood were out a sauntering in the orchard the two little girls of which the youngest namely cecilia was not yet quite eight years old were arm in arm and walking with that lovely negligence and those unstudied graces so peculiar to a state of childhood they hummed over a delightful roundelay then fashionable in the mouth of every songster in the village while little george preceded them at leisure piping on an english flute to harmonize their discords  what a series of delightful gambols entertained them in the orhard but at last our cecilia and lucinda both cast a longing look upon the fruit trees round about them in particular an apple tree attracted their attention all the apples had been gathered several days before but still a few that had been overlooked were here and there discovered hanging and the deep vermillion that tinged them and which the leaves could not entirely hide invited as it were the hand to come and take them george sprung forward climbed the tree which they were admiring and threw down as many apples as his hand cld reach while the children held their aprons open to receive them  chance so ordered it that two or three of what were thought the finest fell into lacindas who piqued herself upon this accidental distribution as she might have done with reason had it been a predetermined preference since george was in reality the prettiest and politest little fellow in the place  lucinda with a joy and triumph in her eyes that looked like insult thus addressed herself to cecilia do but see how fine and large my apples are while yours are hardly lf so hsome cecilia at these words hung down her head and putting on a serious countenance kept silence during the remainder of their wak it was in vain that george studied by a hundred assiduties to bring the little maiden back to reason to spread a smile again upon her cloaded countenance and to make those lips pronounce a syilable whose prattle ha till then been so agreeable  not long after this lucinda took leave when they had got upon the terrace and were near home before they entered george addressed his sister as he always called her asking why she seemed so angry with him certainly you cannot be offended said he that lucinda had her share of the apples you know very well i have always loved you most and would have shown it in the tree by throwing you the finest apples but i know not how it chanced my dear they fell into miss lucindas apron could i take them from her ask yourself that question and besides i thought you far more generous than to take offense at such a trifle you shall see the very first occasion that presents itself of showing you my real sentiments it was not my design to vex you  heydey mr george said cecilia and who told you that i was vexed suppose miss lucindas apples had been even ten times finer than what i had is that any thing to me i am no glutton and you know that very well sir neither should i in the least have minded it but for the saucy little creatures looks i will not endure them that i will not and as for you fall down upon your knees this instant or i will never while i live forgive you  o i cannot do that by any means said george bending half his body backwards as he spoke for by doing so i should confess a fault with which you have no right to charge me i am no storyteller and must say it is very wrong in you miss cecilia if you will not believe that i did not mean to vex you  very wrong in me replied the other very wrong in me what do you mean sir but i see why you affront me thus it is because miss lucinda is your favorite and so saying and bestowing a contemptuous curtsy on him while she looked another way she went into the house in a pet  as dinner was now ready they sat down but pouted at each other all the time it lasted cecilia did not drink even once because she must have said your good health george and george on his part was so piqued at her injustice that he also thought proper to preserve his dignity and yet the little lady would steal a glance still every now and then at george and from a corner of her eye consider all his motions as it happened one of these sly glances met with one of georges who was no less slily studying cecilias motions being thus surprised she turned immediately toward another object and as george took this to proceed from disdain though in reality it did not he affected great indifference and went on eating just as if he did not care a farthing for her  when the cloth was removed and the wine and sruit brought in unluckily poor cecilia mortified as she was at georges whole behavior replied a little disrespectfully to her mama who had besides been obliged to ask her the question twice over and she was therefore ordered instantly from table she obeyed and bursting out into a flood of tears withdrew as if she knew not whither she was going as the door was open that conducted to the garden she passed out that way and as it were by instinct went to hide her sorrow in an arbor at the bottom of it there while she burst out again into a flood of tears and sighed most lamentably she repented of the quarrel that she had picked with george who always used upon such sad occasions to alleviate her distress by weeping with her  george remaining at the table could not think of cecilia in csgrae and not feel greatly for her situation they had harly let him take two peaches before he set about contriving means to convey them into his pocket for por cecilia whom he designed afterward to visit in the garden upon some pretense or other which he did not doubt but he should be able to invent and yet he greatly appreended that his intention would be discovered he pushed back his chair and asterwards brought it forward more than menty times and was continually looking down for something on the carpet then all of a sudden look at pretty laura look at rover cried he seeming to take notice of two dogs in the apartment and at the same time he had got a peach ready to slip into his pocket if he could but fix my lords and ladys observation upon something at a distance from him  see papa mama how prettily they are playing do but turn about they will make you die with laughing  oh red my lord they will not eat one another that i will answer for and having just glanced at them put himself so soon into his first position that poor george who thought himself that moment sure of pocketing the peach was disconcerted and obliged to put it down again upon the table  lady eustace had observed him and conjectured his intention therefore having for a while enjoyed the little boys embarrassment she made his lordship privy to the affair as well as she was able and in dumb show bade him turn his head on one side which he did accordingly but could not hide a smile that notwithstanding all his gravity escaped him  however george who thought himself as yet quite undiscovered but was fearful lest this device again repeated might betray him instantly resorted to another stratagem he took one peach and placed it in the hollow of his hands put both together after which he lifted it to his mouth and made as if he had really been eating by an imitation of the noise and motion which people make when they are chewing then while with his left hand he luckily found means to clap his peach into a cavity that he had hollowed beforehand in the napkin on his knees he put his right hand out to take the other which he served exactly in the same manner  some few minutes had now passed and as it happened my lord and lady had quite forgot little george and were conversing with each other in their usual manner so that george supposing this a proper opportunity to get away rose up from table with both peaches in the napkin and began to imite the mewing of a cat which a young shepherd boy had lately taught him and his view in this was to engage the attention both of pompey and rover which he did and put them into motion lady eustace somewhat angry at these mewings interrupted him what now said she and added well but george if our discourse displeases you i fancy you may go and mew a little in the garden george put on a feigned embarrassment at this reproof which was another thing that he wanted he runs up therefore to laura saying see mama she wants to bite poor rover and in turning he dexteroussy whipped the napkin all at once into his pocket and pretended to run after laura with an intent to punish her laura scampered toward the door which cecilia had left open when she went into the garden and away went master george pursuing him  george george said lady eustace pray where are you going george stopped short my dear mama said he i will take a turn if you please in the garden will not you let me i am sure you will give me leave but afterward as her ladyship returned no answer he lowered his voice and in a suppliant manner added pray my dear mama do let me you shall see how well i will behave myself in that case answered she i will give you leave go  what words can express the greatness of his joy he was so joyful that not minding how he ran his foot slipped and he fell down by great good luck the peaches were not damaged in the fall he got up again instantly and ran to seek his sister in every nook and corner of the garden  george was got by this time to the arbor where he saw poor cecilia wonderfully changed and in an attitude of sorrow and repentance she was now exceedingly unhappy she had grieved the three best friends that she had her worthy parents and her own dear george  my sweetest cecilia said george and fell down on his knees before her let us be friends i would freely ask forgiveness for my fault if i had really intended to displease you yet if you will ask my pardon i will ask yours also will you come forgive cecilia let us be friends again here here are two nice peaches i could not think of tasting them as you were not to have your share  ah my dearest george said cecilia squeezing his hand wh she spoke and weeping on his shoulder what a good sweettempered little fellow i have always found you cinly continued she and sobbed while she spoke certainly a friend in ones misfortunes is a real friend indeed but i will not take your peaches it would have been pitiful behavior in me had i been vexed this morning for the loss of half a dozen apples you do not think that i was george do you no it wa the insulting look with which that pert miss lucinda viewed me but i will not think about her now will you forgive me added she and with her handkerchief wiped off the tears that she had let fall on georges hand i know i sometimes love to plague you but keep your peaches now i will not eat them  well then sister answered george whenever the fancy comes into your head even plague me just as long as you think proper yet i will never let another do so you understand me but as to these two peaches i cannot eat them i have told you so already and was never guilty of a story  no nor i said cecilia and that moment flung them both away into the public road i cannot endure the thoughts of having made a quarrel up for interested reasons  but as we are now close friends again how happy would it make me if i could but get mamas permission to appear and ask her pardon  oh i will fly and get it for you answered george and hardly had pronounced the words when he was got a good way from the arbor i will inform mama continued he that it was i who made you anger her by having vexed you in the morning  in effect he succeeded sooner than he expected  indeed what errors would not any reasonable woman overlook in favor of a friendship so affectionate and generous  the spirit of contradiction mrs cranfield helen her daughter helen no mama i had much rather finish this purse   mrs cranfield but then helen caroline would certainly be a great deal better pleased with the workbag do not you recollect she seemed delighted when you showed her yours and the bag that you have above stairs is made exactly like it   helen notwithstanding that mama i know she would like the purse a great deal better   mrs cranfield be it so but will the purse be finished there are still at least a dozen rows to do whereas the workbag only wants a ribband to complete it sure you would not pay a visit to your cousin on her birthday and go there without some present for her   helen o mama you know i should not like to do so but believe me you shall see the purse very soon finished   mrs cranfield think before you come to any resolution in the affair your father i suppose you know sets out at four oclock exactly and if any one among you has not finished what she had to do that one will not go with him   helen he sets out at five oclock mama not four   mrs cranfield helen will you never be rid of this shocking trick will you always be determined to assert the absolute reverse of every thing that your hear   helen but if i am sure that papa sets out at five and not before   mrs cranfield well well helen it will very soon be seen which is in the right but i advise you as a friend to be prepared against the hour that i mention   helen o if that be al mama you may be sure to find me ready even at four for look ye it is as one may say quite finished i should gain a quarter of a hour beside were i to run and work below there in the garden   mrs cranfield why so pray   helen because it is so much lighter there   mrs cranfield but sure you will lose a deal of time in going thither and returning   helen o do not fear but i shall recover it again my work ll go on ten times the better for it   mrs cranfield as you please helen but remember i have forewarned you what may be the case   helen i will take the consequence upon myself and run as fast as possible  in fact she did run thither very fast so fast that she arrived quite out of breath she wanted more than half a dozen minutes to recover and at last when she was set at work her hands were in a tremble owing to her flurry so that she frequently took up one stitch for another in the end when she was quite recovered one must own she pushed her work on very fast and yet in spite of all her diligence it seemed to grow beneath her fingers mrs cranfield who was really uneasy came to find her   mrs cranfield well helen how goes business forward have you finished   helen no not yet mama nor is it five oclock yet   mrs cranfield right helen but it is four the clock has just struck   helen not struck mama i have been listening so i am sure of that   mrs cranfield

and i must stay at home quite melancholy i that waited with so much impatience for this day caroline will have a present from every one of them and i the eldest am not of the party what will she think of me   mrs cranfield in reality the case is pitiable i must own and more particularly so as it depended on yourself alone to shun this mortifying situation i forewarned you what would be the case in proper time and if instead of being obstinely bent to go on with your purse you had but put a ribband to your workbag if you had not lost so many minutes as you did in running hither if you had not taken it into your head from the first that your father was not to set out till five you would have faved yourself all this vexation the misfortune is now come and you have only to support it as you ought with patience   helen but my aunt and uncle what will they think of me they will imagine that i am in disgrace or else that i do not love my cousin   mrs cranfield you must own helen they will have some reason to suspect as much   helen ah dear mama instead of lessening you increase my sorrow   mrs cranfield no helen i am no less sorrowful than you but then if you think proper i can end your sorrow   helen ah now you are quite good yes yes i will make an end as soon as possible and then we two will take the purse my uncle aunt and cousin too will be agreeably surprised and see that my coming so late was not my fault i suppose then you will send out to fetch a cousin and in the mean time i shall finish   mrs cranfield no helen that would be to disobey your father and deprive you of the benefit accruing from a useful lesson you shall not at least today go see your cousin but may have it in your power to be as happy as you would have been by going i have a certain method to propose to you for that purpose   helen and what is it pray mama   mrs cranfield to form from this time forward a determined resolution not to settle matters just as you yourself think proper to renounce particularly that intolerable trick that you have of contradicting everlastingly whatever you hear said and to rid yourself of the vile habit of opposing your own ridiculous ideas to the counsels of such people as you know to be wiser than yourself i am persuaded you have sufficient courage to take up any resolution and to support it   helen yes indeed mama i will i will so   mrs cranfield i expected nothing less from you helen and if during the remainder of the week i see you persevere in your laudable resolution we will go next saturday and see your cousin we shall then carry her the purse and the workbag also which will make her think that you have delayed your present with a view of complimenting her with something worthier of herself and more expressive of your generosity   helen embracing her mama oh dear mama once more you make me happy   mrs cranfield you helen make me no less happy possibly this very moment you are laying the foundation of your whole future happiness   caesar and pompey mr saunders had brought up two handsome dogs one caesar and the other pompey he had named them so not with the wish or expectation that they should one day become rivals like the two illustrious commanders whose names they bore but though both were littered at a birth had always fed together and been treated with an absolute equality yet it was not long before they manifested very different tempers  caesar was extremely meek and docile pompey rough and quarrelsome  the generous caesar jumped for joy when any one caressed him and never took it ill that his brother should be fondled in the same manner but the surly pompey on the other hand whenever mr saunders had him in his lap would growl if caesar met with the least notice the least smile or token of affection  when the friends of mr saunders coming on a visit brought their dogs our caesar would immediately get in among them and endeavor to amuse his company and as his nature was extremely pliant and insinuating and his manners very winning they were always at their ease whenever it was his part to entertain them they would play and frisk about the apartments just as if they had been all at school with one another the good caesar did his utmost to set off their beauty and activity that mr saunders might be pleased with their appearance and induced to do them some good turn or other  what did pompey do in the mean time he would get into a corner and be all day barking at the strangers if unhappily they drew too near him he would then be sure to grin and snarl and often bite their tails or ears and if his master noticed any one among them for his breeding and good parts he would howl with all his might as if the house was robbing  mr saunders had remarked this odious temper some time past in pompey and begun already to neglect him caesar on the other hand gained something every day on his affection  on a certain day as he was set at table he resolved to try their dispositions more than he ever yet had done they were both attending at the table pompey being nearest for the honest caesar to avoid dissension always gave him up with pleasure the foremost place and mr saunders held out pompey a nice piece of juicy meat which he immediately fell a chewing caesar was not discontented in the least at this but waited with the greatest good humor till his turn should come his turn soon came but mr saunders threw him nothing but a hard dry bone he took it without any sign of discontent but hardly had the churlish pompey observed caesar busy with his share though much inferior to his own than he rejected with disdain the bit between his teeth and fell on caesar to obtain his bone the gentle caesar made no manner of resistance but imagining that it might please the fickle taste of pompey yielded it at once  do not think my friends that this condescension on the part of caesar was the effect of cowardice or even weakness in him he had given ample testimony of his strength and resolution very lately in a contest where he had been engaged on account of pompey whose intolerable surliness had drawn down upon him the resentment of a dog that lived in the neighborhood he had not fought above five minutes though it was he himself who had previously provoked the fight before he ran away while caesar though without a friend to take his part continued the engagement like a hero and acquired at last such glory as to make his adversary bite the dust  this anecdote his master knew and as his character for courage was so thoroughly confirmed he made him take the bit of juicy meat that he had before thrown to pompey but which pompey had rejected caesar my good fellow said his master it is but just that you should enjoy your brothers portion since he first took yours and therefore eat it  pompey scowled at caesar seeing the affection that accompanied these words in mr saunderss countenance and mr saunders added since you have shown yourself thus complaisant and generous toward him who treats you with such jalousy and envy you shall be in future my own dog and range about the house as you think proper but your brother shall be tied up in the yard so quick a chain for pompey and let some one bid the carpenter this moment knock up a kennel for him accordingly this last was instantly conducted to his station while the other had his liberty to walk about the apartments  pompey would very probably have enjoyed with insoleace so great a mark of favor had he gained the advantage in his masters judgment but the heart of caesar bled at the idea of his brothers sentence and he essayed all means to soften his condition when the servants gave him any thing he would be sure to carry it to pompey wag his tail with pleasure and invite him to regale upon it and at night he would not fail to visit pompey in his house amusing him in the midst of his sufferings by all possible means and for hours together warming his benumbed limbs  but pompey far from being softened by such kind actions never welcomed caesar to his kennel nor received him otherwise than with continual howlings so that very quickly after rage inflamed his blood his heart was ulcerated and his entrails perfectly dried up  you children who read this if there be any one among you of a disposition such as pompey had consider what a miserable lot awaits you and reflect upon his punishment you will otherwise lead a life of sorrow and humiliation and expire in horror  the little girl with whiskers will not you do what i bid you then mr obstanacy come sir obey or else you will be the worse off for it i can tell you thus camilla a pert little vixen of whom we are now going to give an account was perpetually rating and commanding her poor brother  might her word be taken for it he did every thing amiss on the contrary whatever she thought of doing was a master piece of reason and reflection the diversions that he proposed were always dull and heavy in her judgment but forgetting this decision when the next day came she would most probably choose them herself as the liveliest and most entertaining her unhappy brother was obliged on pain of being soundly lectured to obey her whims and fancies if he durst attempt to show her the unreasonableness of her procedure she would be that moment in her airs his play things then were sure to go to ruin and himself was forced to mope without amusement in a corner of the room  camillas parents had a hundred times endeavoared to break her of this fault her mother in particular was always telling her that people never gained the love of others if they were not complaisant and gentle that a little girl who would on all occasions set up her own will by way of law for others would be found the most intolerable creature in the universe these prudent lessons or instructions made no manner of impression on her heart her brother sick of so much tyranny began already to lose something of his love and kindness for her and camilla was so far from shaking off her domineering disposition on that account that she became a hundred times more arbitrary and insulting  as it chanced a gentleman of understanding and who was always remarkably sincere and open in his speech and conduct dined one day upon an invitation with camillas parents he observed with what a haughty air she treated her poor little brother nay and every body in the room at first through mere politeness he kept silence but tired out ere long with her impertinence he began addressing his discourse to mrs fleming her mama as follows had i such a little girl as yours i know what i would do  what sir said mrs fleming  you shall hear replied the gentleman i am lately come from france and as i liked to see the soldiers exercise i amused myself by visiting the grand parade where the soldiers are drawn up as frequently as i had leisure among the soldiers there were many that i observed with whiskers and one cannot but acknowledge they looked very fierce as soldiers should now had i a child like your camilla i would give her instantly a soldiers uniform and i would clap a pair of whiskers on her and make her a swiss corporal so that she might completely satisfy her passion for commanding  hearing this camilla stood confounded she could not refrain from blushing and even wept  from that time forward she was sensible how much a tyranizing disposition misbecame her and resolved to shun the mortifying consequences which it would soon or late bring down upon her this resolution assisted by the prudent counsels of her mother quickly proved successful  such a change was doubtless very prudent on her part it were however to be wished for all young ladies laboring under such a fault that they would yield obedience to the kind instruction of their parents on this subject and not wait till such time as a man of understanding tells them to their face that they would look better in a surly soldiers uniform with whiskers than set off with nice white cambrick frocks like all goodnatured little ladies  the scar ferdinand from nature had received a soul endued with elevated thoughts and generous notions he possessed a lively turn of mind a strong and quick imagination with a cheerful temper his whole person in a word and his polite behavior won him every heart  however with so many amiable qualities he had a certain great defect extremely inconvenient to his friends of giving way to every slight impression and yielding up his soul to the emotions which any accidental circumstance might raise within him  when he sought amusement in the circle of his playmates trifling contradictions ruffled his impatient disposition and they saw the fire of rage in a moment inflame his whole countenance he stamped upon the ground cried out and was beside himself with passion  once upon a time as he was walking in his chamber to and fro and meditating on the necessary preparations for a treat which his father had permitted him to give his sister marcian his dear friend and favorite intended to communicate his notions on the subject buried as he was in thought he saw not marcian marcian therefore having called out to him but in vain drew nearer and began to pull him by the sleeve but ferdinand disturbed and out of patience with these interruptions unexpectedly turned round with so much rudeness that he sent poor marcian quite across the apartment to fall down beside the wainscot  marcian after he dropped lay still without the least appearance of life to which i am to add that in falling he had siruck his head against the moulding of a bookcase and received a wound as ferdinand then fancied in the temple whence there came a deal of blood  heavens reader what a shocking prospect was this for ferdinand who never had intended any harm to marcian and for whom he would have even lost his life if there had been occasion  ferdinand fell down beside him lamentably crying out he is dead he is dead i have killed my friend instead of trying any means for his recovery he remained stretched all along uttering dismal groans happily his father heard him he came running up took marcian in his arms and having laid him on a bed called out for salts and threw cold water in his face which recovered him a little  the return of marcian to new life transported ferdinand with joy but as he might relapse it was not great enough to take away entirely his anxiety  a surgeon being sent for probed the wound he found it to be not in the temple but so very near it that the difference of a hairs breadth in its position would have made it dangerous indeed if not quite mortal being carried home he soon became delirious  ferdinand could by no means be persuaded to leave marcian he took up his station by his dear friends pillow and maintained the profoundest silence marcian frequently pronounced the name of ferdinand while his delirium lasted my dear ferdinand he would say in what had i offended you that i should be treated thus yet it is quite impossible that you should be less afflicted than myself for having wounded me without the least degree of provocation let it not however grieve your generous nature i forgive you and do you forgive me likewise ferdinand for having put you as i must have done into a passion it was not my wish to vex you  this discourse which marcian thus addressed to ferdinand without observing him though present and even holding him continually by the hand redoubled his affliction every word proceeding from the lips of marcian as it served but to proclaim the greatness of his friendship was a poignard to the heart of ferdinand  at last however it pleased god for ferdinands great consolation to assuage the violence of the fever in ten days time the patient was enabled to get up  what tongue can represent the joy of ferdinand it is not to be comprehended certainly by any one unless he himself has felt beforehand the sorrow which ferdinand experienced all the while that he was a witness of his friends distressful situation  marcian being at last thoroughly recovered ferdinand resumed his former cheerful humor and not needing any other lesson than the sorrowful event that had so late y happened he labored hard to overcome the vehemence of temper to which he had been a slave  marcian in a very little time had no mark of the accident remaining but a trifling scar as just now mentioned near the temple ferdinand could never see this scar without emotion even when they were both come to years of manhood it became in short the seal of that much closer friendship in which they were ever afterward mutually united  the silk slip little matilda had worn nothing but a plain white frock till she was eight years old neat red morocco shoes with silver buckles set off her small feet her ebon hair which had never yet felt the torturing iron floated in large curls upon her shoulders  she had been one day in the company of certain little girls who though not older than herself were dressed already like great ladies and the richness of their clothes awakened in her heart the first vain notions that she had ever had within it  dear mama said she returning from the house where she had met with these fine ladies i have seen this afternoon the three miss flowerdales i suppose you know them the eldest of them must be younger than myself o dear mama how sweetly they were dressed their parents sure must have a deal of pleasure seeing them so fine i dare say they are not so rich as you so give me if you please a fine silk slip with such embroidered shoes as they had on and let my hair be dressed by mr frizzle who they tell me is extremely clever  the mother i desire no better if to do so will contribute to your satisfaction but i fear with all this elegance you will find yourself not quite so happy as you have been hitherto in the simplicity of such plain things as you generally wore   matilda and why so mama   the mother because you will be eternally afraid of spotting and even of rumpling what you wear a dress so elegant as that of the miss flowerdales will require the greatest care and attention in the wear that it may do you honor if it gets one spot the beauty will be lost for ever as one cannot put it in the washtub to recover its first luster and however rich you may suppose me i shall not be rich enough to let you have a new silk slip whenever you may want one   matilda oh if that be all mama do not make yourself uneasy i will be very careful of it   the mother will you well then i must give you such a dress but still remember that i have hinted what uneasiness your vanity may cause you   unpersuaded by the wisdom of this counsel matilda did not lose a moment in destroying all the pleasure and enjoyment of her infancy her hair which had till then hung down at liberty was now to be confined in paper and squeezed close between a burning hot pair of tongs and that fine jet which had till now so happily set off the whiteness of her forehead was to disappear beneath a clot of powder and pomatum  two days after matilda had a handsome slip brought home of peagreen taffety with fine pink trimmings and a pair of strawworked shoes to match them the taste that appeared in her clothes their vivid color and elegance of make  charmed the eye but when she had them on it was evident that her limbs were under great constraint her motions had no longer their accustomed ease and freedom and her infant countenance amidst so vast a quantity of flowers silk gauze and ribbands lost entirely every trace of ingenuous simplicity  she was notwithstanding quite enchanted at her metamorphosis her eyes with mighty satisfaction wandered over her whole little person and were never taken off except when she looked round about her to find out some glass in the apartment that might represent before her at full length the idol which she then worshipped  she had wrought on her mama to send out cards of invitation to her little friends that when they came to visit her she might enjoy a feast in viewing their surprise and admiration when they had all met together she walked to and fro before them like a peacock and from her behavior any one would have imagined that she supposed herself an empress and considered those about her as subjected to her empire but alas this triumph was but of a very short duration and a multitude of mortifying circumstances followed it  the children were permitted to go out a walking in the fields near that part of the town where she lived matilda therefore led the way and they reached in ten or fifteen minutes a delightful country  a luxuriant meadow first of all attracted their attention it was every where enamelled with a vast variety of charming flowers and butterflies whose wings were of a thousand mingled colors hovered in each quarter of it the gay little ladies hunted these fine butterflies they dexterously caught but did not hurt them and when once they had examined all their beauty let them go and with their eyes pursued the little creatures as they fluttered to and fro they employed themselves in making nosegays likewise of the flowers that sprung up in the meadow which they gathered for that purpose  matilda who from pride had first of all disdained these mean amusements wanted very soon to share the entertainment that they afforded but the ground they told her might be damp in which case she would stain her shoes and damage her fine slip for they had now discovered that her intention in thus bringing them together was to vex them only with a sight of her fine clothes and they resolved to mortify her in their turn  she was of course obliged to be solitary and sit still while she observed the sprightly cheerfulness of her companions who sported round about her the delight of contemplating on her peagreen slip was compared thereto a very sorry kind of entertainment  at the corner of the meadow there was a sort of little grove in which was to be heard the music of a thousand birds that seemed as if inviting every person who went through the meadow to go thither and enjoy the coolness of the shade this grove our children entered jumping as they went along with joy poor matilda would have followed them but she was told that the bushes would tear all her finery to pieces she observed her friends to divert themselves at pussey in the corner and pursue each other through the trees the more she heard them shout with joy the more as any one might have expected she was peevish and illhumoured  but the youngest of her visitors had some sort of compassion on her she had just found out a corner where there grew a quantity of fine wild strawberries and therefore beckoned to her to come and eat part of them she would willingly have done so but had scarcely got into the grove when unexpectedly a loud cry was heard the children gathered to the spot and found poor matilda fastened by the gauze upon her hat and ribbands to a branch of white thorn from which she could not by any means disengage herself they made haste to loose the pins that held her hat on but to add to her affliction as her hair which had been frizzed with so much labor was likewise entangled with the branch of white thorn it cost her almost a whole lock before she could be set at liberty and thus all at once the charming superstructure of her headdress was absolutely pulled to pieces  it is not difficult to guess how little this misfortune thus befalling matilda touched her playmates when they found as we have said already why she had invited them instead of consolation which she needed and perhaps expected they could hardly keep from laughing at her comical appearance and did actually jeer her with a hundred wicked witticisms after having smoothed her down a little they ran off in search of fresh amusement toward a hill that they saw at some small distance from them  matilda however could not without very great difficulty reach this hill her strait shoes which had been made so to set off her little feet the better were a great obstruction to her speed nor was this all the mischief for her stays were drawn so close that she could not easily fetch breath she would have now been happy to go home and change her dress in order to be at ease but then she knew that her little friends would never have consented upon her account to be deprived of their amusement  they had got by this time to the summit of the hill and were enjoying the fine view which a spacious horizon presented them on every side they saw on one hand verdant meadows on the other yellow harvests before them rivulets meandering through the country and by way of termination to the landscape a large river on whose banks were many pleasant country houses so magnificent a prospect charmed them they even danced about with joy while matilda at the bottom of the hill for she was absolutely out of breath and could not possibly get further was devoured with sorrow  she had time and opportunity enough in such a situation to make many sad reflections to what purpose said she to herself are these fine clothes how much pleasure do they not prevent me from enjoying and what pain do i not suffer merely from having put them on  she was giving up her mind to these afflicting thoughts when suddenly she heard her friends come running down the hill and all cry out together as they passed her run run matilda there is a dreadful storm behind the hill it is coming toward us if you do not make haste your slip will soon be wet quite through  matilda felt her strength returning at the fear of such a great misfortune as her playmates threatened she forgot her weariness her pinched feet and her tight lacing and made tolerable haste to reach some place of shelter but in spite of all her efforts to shun so grievous a misfortune as the spoiling of her clothes she could not run so fast as her companions who were lightly dressed then too every moment she was stopped at one time by her hoop and flounces in the narrow paths by which she was obliged to go at another by her train which was frequently caught fast by the furze and at others by the fine seaffold work about her head on which the wind bent down the branches of those trees under which she was forced to pass in her way homeward  at that moment too the storm burst forth in all its fury and there fell a shower of hail and rain mixed together after all but matilda had regained their several habitations  in the end however matilda got home likewise but wet through and through she had besides left one of her fine shoes behind her in a heap of dung which as she hurried homeward she had scrambled over without seeing it and to increase the list of her disasters she had not quite cleared the meadow when a gust of wind blew off her hat into the middle of a dirty pool of water  they had all the trouble that one can possibly imagine to undress her so much had the sweat and rain even glued her shift and other garments to her body so that her whole dress was spoiled and absolutely good for nothing  shall i have another slip my dear made up for you against tomorrow said her mother drily seeing her in tears  o no mama said matilda kissng her i am convinced fine clothes can never make the wearer of them happy let me take up with my nice white frock again and have no more pomatum in my hair till i am eight or ten years older than at present and forgive my folly  matilda with the dress of childhood came again into the full possession of her liberty and seemed as modest and as charming as she had ever been neither did her dear mama regret the loss that she had experienced in the purchase of this fine silk slip etc since it proved the means of reinstating her beloved daughter in the happiness which her vanity and folly would have taken from her had it not been for this useful lesson  the fire a drama in one act characters mr and mrs creswell adrian their children julia their children trueman a farmer jane his wife lubbin their children sukey their children gilbert mr creswells groom scene

that adrian should refuse a drop of any thing that is good because he cannot get tidings of his parents   sukey oh i know you well enough your sister might be burnt alive and you not eat a mouthful less on that account for my part i should be like adrian i should hardly think of eating if our house were set on fire and no one could inform me what had happened to my father mother or even brother   lubbin no nor i  provided i were not hungry   sukey can one then be hungry in such a case look ye lubbin i have not the least degree of appetite to see poor adrian weep and take on so has made me quite forget my hunger   lubbin so you will not eat your milkpottage this morning   sukey what you want it after having swallowed your own breakfast with yorkshire cake into the bargain   lubbin no i would only take your breakfast that if neither you nor adrian wished to have it nothing might be loft that is all but let me have the tumbler i have not drunk any thing yet   sukey giving him the tumbler make haste then adrian is very dry   lubbin after drinking stay stay i will fill it for him   sukey without rincing it   lubbin do you suppose then that i have poison in my mouth   sukey very proper truly with the crumbs about the rim i will rince it out myself young gentlemen are used to cleanliness and i should wish to let him see as much propriety and neatness in our cottage as at home she rinces the tumbler fills it up and then goes out   lubbin alone so there is my breakfast done suppose now that i should run to town and see the fire i shall not be missed if i set out stay there but half an hour or so and then come back it is nothing but a good sound scolding from my mother however i will go a little way and then determine it is not more than twelve or thirteen minutes walk before i am there  come come faint heart the proverb tells us never won fair lady he sets off but meets his father   scene iii lubbin trueman with a chest upon his shoulders tired and out of breath lubbin what you are come back father i was going on a little way to meet you   trueman with anxiety were you and is adrian here   lubbin yes yes not long ago arrived   trueman putting down the chest thank god then the whole family are safe he sits down upon the chest let me take breath a little   lubbin will not you come in father   trueman no no i will remain here in the open air till i am recovered from my hurry go and tell your mother that i am returned   trueman alone wiping his face i shall not die then without having in my turn obliged my benefactor   scene iv trueman jane adrian lubbin sukey jane running from the farmhouse and embracing trueman ah my dear what joy to see you come back safe   trueman embracing jane in return my life but adrian where is he pray let me see him   adrian running up here i am here here father looking round about him but what are you alone where is my papa mama and little sister   trueman safe my child quite safe  embrace me   adrian jumping up into his arms o what joy   jane we have been all in very great perplexity our neighbors are come back already   trueman they had not their benefactor to preserve as i had   jane but the fire dear thomas is it out and all the mischief over   trueman over jane the whole street is in flames if you could only see the ruins and the multitude of people women with their hair about their ears all running to and fro and calling out to find their husbands and poor children to which add the found of bells the noise of carts and engines with the crush of houses when the timbers are burnt through the frightened horses and the throng of people driving full against you i cannot tell you how i made my way amidst the flames that crossed before me and the burning beams that seemed ready every moment to fall down and crush me   jane bless us you make my blood run cold   sukey see see mother how his hair and eyebrows are all singed   trueman and see my arm too but why should i complain could i have only got away with life i should not have mattered losing a limb for mr creswell   jane how my dear a limb   trueman what wife to save our benefactor was it not through his means that we both came together are we not indebted to his generosity not only for this farm but for every thing and what is still more my jewel was it not your milk that reared his weakly child now so strong and hearty adrian clings to jane did i say that i should not have mattered losing a limb for mr creswell  i say more i would have given my life to save him   jane then you have been able to assist him   trueman yes i have that happiness to boast he himself his lady and his daughter had scarce got out of their house as they supposed in safety when a halfburnt beam fell down into the street before them happily i was not ten yards off the people fancied that they were crushed beneath its weight and ran away i heard their cries came back and rushing through the burning ruins brought them off i had already saved this chest that you see here and my cart besides is loaded with the greatest part of their most valuable furniture   adrian be sure my father will most richly recompense you   trueman i am recompensed already my dear little friend your father did not perhaps expect such a service at my hands and i have saved him in that thought i am much better paid than in receiving any recompense but this is not the whole i dare say he will be here presently and all his family and people   adrian what then shall i see them soon   trueman yes my adrian but run wife and make a little preparation to receive them let some ale be drawn and have the cows milked instantly air sheets to put on all our beds and as for us we will take up our lodging in the stable   jane be it so i will play my part i warrant you   scene v trueman adrian lubbin sukey trueman and i will go put the hay up in some kind of order in the barn and make a little room for those who may come hither requiring some shelter all the fields alas are covered with them i imagine i still see them some struck speechless gaze with absolute insensibility while they behold their houses burning or else fall down on the ground fatigued and frightened others run along like madmen wring their hands or pull their hair up by the roots and uttering fearful cries attempt to force their passage through a line of soldiers who with bayonets keep them off that they may save the property of the sufferers from being plundered   sukey o my poor dear adrian had you been there they would have trod you under foot   trueman as soon as they bring back my horses i will go out again and take up all the children women and old men that i meet had i been the poorest person in the village this misfortune would have rendered me the richest since the unhappy whom i shall succor will belong to me he stoops to take the chest up   lubbin dear father let me help you   trueman no no have a care it is far too heavy for your strength go rather and bid humphry heat the oven and put all our kitchen things in order and let carter know that i want some flour sent in these miserable people who are burnt out of their habitations shall at least find wherewithal to satisfy their wants thank god i am not so poor that any one applying to my charity should die for want of food if i had nothing else i would give them my last bit of bread he and lubbin go out   scene vi adrian sukey sukey oh that i would share with you too adrian who alas would have supposed that i should have ever seen you in your present situation   adrian who indeed my dearest sukey for it is very hard in one night to lose every thing   sukey be comforted however my dear friend for do not you recollect how happy we were once together here when we were less a great deal than at present well we will be as happy with each other again do you fear that you can want any thing as long as i have any thing to give you   adrian taking sukey by the hand no i do not indeed but then i thought it would have been my part to make you happy to get you a good husband as papa has often said in joke and to take care of your children like my own   sukey well now i must contrive to do all this myself and when we love each other it is exactly the same thing i will get you all the finest flowers that i can make free to pull in our garden and whatever fruit they will let me gather you shall also have my bed and i will sleep all night long upon the ground beside you   adrian embracing her o my dear dear sukey how i ought to love you   sukey you shall see likewise what care i will take of julia i will be always with you both we drank you know the same milk and is not that all the same as if you were my brother pray and i your sister   adrian yes and you shall always be my sister and i do not know which of the two i shall love best for the future you or julia i will present you also to papa that you may be his daughter but when think you will he come   sukey why make yourself uneasy you have been told that he is safe   adrian but my father is just like yours and who can tell but he will go back again into the flames to save some friend or other i must therefore be uneasy till i see him once again but hark ye do not i hear a tread on the other side of the hill oh if it were he   scene vii adrian sukey gilbert adrian ah gilbert   gilbert ah my little master you are safe then   adrian truly there is great need to talk about my safety where is papa mama and julia are they with you   gilbert not knowing what to say with me   adrian yes you have not left them behind sure   gilbert behind turning about they are not behind me   adrian they are not come with you then   gilbert unless they be here i do not know where they are   adrian impatintly you do not come here to seek them do you   gilbert in confusion do not be frightened my dear little master  are they not come hither   sukey none but adrian   adrian he is confounded and has some bad news to tell me  they are lost even after all the pains that honest trueman took to save them   gilbert hear me  there is no cause at least i hope not to alarm yourself about an hour or forty minutes after they had forced me from you to assist the sufferers i found means to get into the crowd  dear master adrian do not be frightened but so it is indeed  i ran about the ruins to discover where my master was but could not come at any tidings of him no nor of my mistress nor miss julia i enquired of every one that i met if they had heard of such a family but constantly was answered no   adrian o heaven take pity on me dear papa mama and julia where where are you perished doubtless   gilbert i have not told you all yet but pray do not be frightened  the worst part of the affair comes now   adrian what is it then why do not you tell me gilbert   gilbert how in heavens name would you have me tell you if you let yourself be frightened in this manner   adrian speak pray gilbert speak   gilbert well then the rumor was as follows that a gentleman a lady and a little girl were crushed to death when they were just got out of doors and thought themselves in safety adrian swoons away   sukey help help help come here to our assistance some one adrian is dying she falls down by him   gilbert why what ails him i mentioned this but as a report and besides they could not tell me who it was it may be nothing after all   sukey why how you talk his fright at what you mentioned overcame him and he quite forgot that my father had preserved them   gilbert feeling adrians cheek o my poor dear little adrian he is as cold as any ice   sukey half getting up and what could bring you here it is you that have killed him   gilbert i  and yet i am sure you heard me bid him not be frightened he raises him a little master adrian he lets him fall again   sukey how you go to work  do not touch him any more  he will die if he is not dead already with such treatment o my dear dear brother adrian  father mother lubbin  why where can they all be she runs in for help   gilbert leaning over adrian no no he is not dead he breathes a little were he dead i would go and fling myself this moment into some pond  he calls out adrian master adrian  if i knew but how to bring him to himself  he blows on adrians face this blowing tries my lungs  it was very foolish i must own in me to tell him what i did but much more so in him to pay attention to it and particularly when i bid him not be frightened  could i possibly speak plainer  adrian adrian  he does not hear me  when my dear wife died i took on very sadly for her but to die on that account would have been very silly  adrian adrian  what had i best do he does not seem as if he would recover ah i see a pump  i will go and fill my hat with water  half a dozen sprinklings very possibly may have a good effect upon him as he is coming back to adrian mr creswell enters leading in mrs creswell and julia gilbert drops his hat and runs away   gilbert heaven forgive me should he find him dead i do not know what he will do for my part i am dead with fear already   mr creswell was not that our gilbert  gilbert what is the matter where is adrian   mrs creswell sure he ran away as if afraid of meeting with us where can he have left him   julia seeing adrian on the ground what is this here a child stooping down o heaven my brother and he is dead   mrs creswell falling down by adrian how julia adrian  yes indeed help help   mr creswell was this misfortune wanting after all examining the body but he is not dead  thank heaven we are better off than that  he breathes a little  my dear life to mrs creswell as adrian needs assistance keep your strength that he may have it   mrs creswell nearly swooning adrian adrian   julia ah my poor dear brother would to heaven the flames had rather taken all from us mr creswell raises mrs creswell and brings adrian to her   mr creswell there is no time to lose  have you your salts about you   mrs creswell i cannot tell i am in so great an agitation after so much fear and fright here is one still greater i would part with all that is left us for a draught of water mr creswell sees the pump and hastens to it   julia feeling in her mothers pocket here is your sal volatile mama while the salts are using hear hear hear me adrian and look up or i shall die with grief he comes a little to himself o heavens he breathes she runs to her papa come come papa come quickly come and see him mr creswell brings a little water in the hollow of his hand and throws it on his face   adrian sighing bitterly oh oh papa papa   mr creswell he supposes i am dead that blockhead gilbert must have frightened him   julia in transport see fee his eyes begin to open   mr creswell my dear child do not you know us   mrs creswell adrian adrian   julia brother   adrian looking round him am i dead or living or where am i he sits up in mrs creswells lap ah my dear mama   mrs creswell my child and have we brought you back to life   adrian turning to his father papa too   julia embracing him my dear adrian my sweet brother i am alive again now you are   adrian oh what joy to see you thus again dear sister he turns to his mother it was your sweet voice mama that brought me back to life   mr creswell to mrs creswell my dear i was lamenting our misfortune just before but now i find that there was a great deal more to be lost than goods and such things   mrs creswell let us not think a moment more about them   mr creswell nay rather we should rejoice that they are in reality so trifling i behold you all three safe and can have nothing to disturb me   julia but brother what brought you into such a situation   adrian would you think it  gilbert   mr creswell there i said so   adrian why he told me that you had all three perished in the flames   julia looking toward the hill ah there he is papa above there they all look up and gilbert draws his head in   mr creswell gilbert gilbert  he is afraid to answer me so do you call him adrian   adrian gilbert  do not be fearful but come down and show yourself  i am alive   gilbert on the hill are you sure of that   adrian i think so did you ever hear a dead man speak   gilbert coming down but stopping on a sudden you do not intend i hope sir to discharge me if you do i need not be at so much trouble to come on   mr creswell see simpleton the consequence of speaking without thought   mrs creswell a little more and you had been the death of adrian   adrian pray mama forgive him it was not his fault   gilbert no certainly i bid him not be frightened adrian holds out his hand however i am glad that you do not intend me any harm and for the future i will think no one dead till such time as i see him ten feet under ground and fairly buried   scene viii adrian mr and mrs creswell julia trueman jane lubbin sukey trueman running in o the wretch where is he   sukey showing gilbert look ye father here gilbert slinks behind his master   trueman who is this sukey and lubbin run toward adrian who presents them both to julia the farmer bows to mr creswell   mr creswell taking him by the hand my friend what means this humble distance with such respect to bow before me my preserver and not only mine but all my familys   trueman yes sir it is another obligation that you have laid upon me i have had the opportunity of showing you my gratitude for all your favors   mr creswell you have done much more for me than ever i did yet for you and more than i shall ever have it in my power to do   trueman what say you sir the service of a moment only i on the other hand have lived these eight years past by means of your bounty you observe these fields this farm from you i had them you have lost your all permit me therefore to return them it will be happiness enough for me that i shall always have it in my power to say i have not been ungrateful to my benefactor   mr creswell well then my good friend i do permit you to return them but on this proviso to enrich you with much better you have luckily for me preserved my strong box that had all my writings in it and those writings are the best part of my fortune so that to you i owe the preservation of my whole property having now no house in london i will go down into the country whither you shall follow me and we will fix our habitation at a seat that i have in norfolk all your children shall be mine   adrian ah dear papa i meant to beg as much see here is my sister sukey and here is lubbin my brother if you knew the love and friendship that they have shown to me possibly i might have now been dead but for their kindness   mrs creswell grasping janes hand henceforth we will be but one family and all our happiness shall be in loving one another like relations   jane in the mean time enter and repose yourselves excuse us if our cottage cannot afford you the accommodations that we certainly could have wished to do   trueman looking toward the hill i see my cart sir and a number of poor people following will you give me leave to go and offer them the service of which they are so much in need   mr creswell i will go with you and console them likewise i am too much interested in the melancholy accident that has distressed them though far less a sufferer by it  less i should have said no sufferer but a gainer for the day which i supposed at first to be so unfortunate gives me back much more than i have lost it gives me in return for such things as with money i can purchase what is far beyond the value of all money  a new family and friends who shall therefore be henceforth precious to my heart   the great garden mr sage had received no very great inheritance from fortune and his parents but was not without the happy secret of limiting his desires to what he possessed and notwithstanding he was frequently obliged to go without a number of conveniences and comforts which others could command by means of their abundance never did one envious thought disturb his equability of temper he had never suffered more than one affliction of considerable magnitude arising from his want of this lifes comforts and that was the loss of an affectionate and virtuous woman torn from his embraces by the hand of death a charming little fellow polydore sage was the only child remaining to console him and the education of this charming little fellow was the single object of his study and attention  polydore was endued by nature with very strong imagination and by this his father had found out the happy secret of improving his reason at a very early time of life namely by exhibiting before him every object in its real point of view of which he had beforehand only given him an idea by a series of strong images arranged in order and selected in a proper moment to produce their full effect he had enabled him already to make many accurate and deep reflections  satisfied with his condition this good father wished particularly to inculcate in his son those principles to which he owed himself the calm of his condition and the peace within his mind yes often would he whisper to himself if i can but accustom him to live contented with his humble fortune and point out to him the folly of putting any value upon what he must not hope to obtain i shall contribute more to make his manhood happy than by leaving him a heap of gold and silver  occupied incessantly on this important lesson he thought fit one evening to accompany his son to vauxhall gardens for the first time in his life immediately on entering polydore was struck with admiration and delight the perfume of the flowers the beauty of the paintings the wellordered disposition of the walks the crowd of men and women who were in them elegantly dressed the incessant motion of the multitude the hum of their discourse the noise of the cascade all joined to attract his contemplation and his eye considered at one view ten thousand objects his good father seeing him if we may say so swallowed up in thought conducted him to that part of the gardens which was more retired from public observation that his senses which were too much occupied by such a crowd of images might be in some degree at rest soon after he proposed indulging him with some refreshment if he liked it  polydore gladly took his fathers offer and soon after having satisfied his appetite and palate spoke as follows  how extremely happy every one here present seems to be i should like papa if we had such a charming garden did you notice what a number of fine carriages were at the door and all those gentlefolks that pass us how well dressed they are i should be glad to know why we must live so savingly when others in the world indulge themselves with every thing that they fancy i begin papa believe me now to see how poor you are but why then are so many around us rich they are not better people sure than you papa  you speak exactly like a child replied the father you begin to see how poor i am now i can tell you i am quite rich  polydore and where then are your riches   mr sage i have a garden bigger by far than this   polydore a garden you papa i should be glad to see it   mr sage when we go into the country you shall see it  they went very soon it being now the season for taking the pleasures of the country and on the very day of their arrival at the country house not far from london mr sage took his son and led him up a hill from whence the eye commanded an extensive prospect on the right was seen a spacious forest whose extremities seemed lost at the horizon on the left appeared a beauteous mixture of fine gardens verdant meadows and vast fields quite covered with the promise of a plenteous harvest close below the hill was stretched a valley watered in its whole extent with a thousand little rills and all this landscape was in motion there were fishermen in one part busy with their nets and husbandmen who in another were employed in gathering fruits and herbs and sportsmen with their greyhounds urging the swift stag and shepherds watching by their flocks or playing near them in the shade and reapers carting their last sheaves and dancing all the way before them as they proceeded homeward this delightful picture captivated mr sage and his son who for a time kept silence till the child began the following conversation  papa when shall we reach your garden   mr sage we are at it now my child   polydore but this is not a garden it is a hill   mr sage look round as far as you can see for this i tell you is my garden yonder forest and these fields are all my property   polydore your property papa you are joking   mr sage no indeed i am not i will convince you in an instant that i dispose of every thing all around us as the owner of it only can do   polydore it will delight me to be sure of that   mr sage if you had all this country what would you do with it   polydore what the owners of estates generally do   mr sage what may that be   polydore in the first place then i would cut down a deal of timber and make firewood of it to be used this winter in the next place i would go a hunting to catch venison and sometimes i would fish i would breed sheep and oxen and in harvest gather in the corn that covers this fine country   mr sage why you comprehend the matter admirably polydore and i am glad to find our notions are so like each others well whatever you would do then i already do and i will convince you of it   polydore how papa   mr sage i say then in the first place i have men who cut down for me in this forest all the wood that i want   polydore and yet i never heard you order them to cut down any for you   mr sage and why not because they have the forethought to prevent me we have always a good fire below and sometimes too up stairs well then i have the wood brought to me from the forest to keep up those fires for here you know we cannot get coals to burn as if we were in london   polydore you have indeed the wood brought to you from this forest but must pay for what you have   mr sage if i were what you call the real owner of this forest should i not be forced as i am at present to pay for what i might have brought me from it   polydore no indeed papa it would be cut down for you and sent in without a penny cost on your part   mr sage you believe so do you on the contrary i think the cost might be a great deal more in that case than at present for you will grant if i possessed the forest i must keep at least a woodman to cut down the trees for firewood   polydore well pass over this but can you go a hunting   mr sage and why should i hunt polydore   polydore for instance to have venison   mr sage could we two then eat a buck or do ourselves entirely   polydore we should have a charming appetite to do so   mr sage well then as i cannot go a hunting i send huntsmen in my place and very probably the venison that you have seen hang up at charing cross where as you remember you went with me lately to buy some was hunted in this forest i can therefore without hunting venison have as much as i think proper   polydore for your money   mr sage well and is it not a charming thing for me that i can come at venison on these terms for i have no wages to pay to those who hunt it for me or provided they should shoot it i have neither to supply them with gun nor ball nor powder those various kinds of dogs that our squire maintains thank heaven they eat up nothing that belongs to me   polydore are those cows too and sheep that graze in yonder meadow yours   mr sage yes truly have not you fresh butter every day i get it from those cows   polydore but papa if all these flocks and all those little rivers too are yours why have not we at dinner every day all sorts of meat and fish as other rich folks i am told have   mr sage do they eat up every thing that their servants set before them   polydore no but they may choose at table whatever they like   mr sage and as for me i make my choice before my victuals come to table every thing that i want i have superfluous things it is true i do not possess but what benefit would they procure me if i had them i should want in that case a superfluous stomach also   polydore wealthy people make good cheer but you papa i fancy do not   mr sage indeed i do and better than the wealthy polydore i have a sauce that almost always fails them namely a good appetite   polydore and have you then a deal of money as they have to satisfy a thousand wishes   mr sage much more money or at least what is better i have no wishes   polydore i believe however there is a deal of pleasure in contenting them   mr sage a hundred times more pleasure child in being content of ones self as i am   polydore but does not god pray love the rich a great deal more than you since he bestows upon them so much gold and silver   mr sage polydore do not you recollect the wine that we had last wednesday on the table when your uncle came to dine and sup with us and which you said was so delicious   polydore yes papa i remember you were so good as to give me half a glass full of it   mr sage but you wanted more i might have let you have it since you know the bottle had a deal left in it even after supper why then did i not oblige you pray   polydore because you were afraid that it would make me ill   mr sage i recollect i told you so and do not you think that i did right   polydore oh as for that you did indeed i know you love me and are always studying how to make me happy so you would not have refused me such a trifle as a glass of wine if you had thought that it would have pleased me and not hurt my health   mr sage and can you think that god loves you less than i do   polydore no papa i cannot after what i have heard you say so often of his goodness   mr sage on the other hand do you believe that he would have found it difficult to give you gold and silver in abundance   polydore no more difficult than i should find it to give any one a handful of the dust that we tread   mr sage on the other hand do you believe that he would have found it difficult to give you gold and silver in abundance   polydore no more difficult than i should find it to give any one a handful of the dust that we tread   mr sage well then if as you acknowledge he is able to bestow these on you and does not bestow them even though he loves you what are you to think of his refusal   polydore that the riches which i desire from him would be hurtful   mr sage are you perfectly convinced of this   polydore yes perfectly and have not a word to say against yet papa    mr sage well why thus shake your head you have still some burden on your heart what is it   polydore notwitstanding all your reasonings i can never bring myself to fancy all this country yours   mr sage and why   polydore because you cannot enjoy it as you please   mr sage you know the famous mr norton   polydore do i know him why that is he who has such charming gardens   mr sage and can he enjoy those gardens as he pleases   polydore no indeed poor man he dares not even eat a bunch of grapes   mr sage and yet you have seen some very fine ones in his garden   polydore i have but they would do him harm   mr sage you see then one may easily possess a number of good things and yet not dare to use them as one likes i dare not use my gardens as i certainly should like because my fortune will not let me and this mr norton dares not use his garden as he likes because his health will not allow him so that i am much the happiest   polydore but papa you love to ride a horseback  do not you   mr sage yes for it is an exercise that does me good when i have time to take it   polydore well then if these meadows are all yours why do not you take the hay that grows upon them and in future keep a horse   mr sage why that is the very thing which i do and those same haycocks that you see there are pobly intended for the horse that i ride   polydore and yet i never saw one in your stable   mr sage heaven be praised i am not at such a great expense   polydore nor do you ride as frequently as you would like   mr sage you are wrong for i am so prudent that i never wish to ride but when a ride would do me good and then i get it for about three shillings god be praised i am rich enough to pay that sum   polydore do not you imagine that to have two fine piebald horses and to be drawn about the country in a fashionable coach would be very pleasant   mr sage agreeable enough but when i think of all the inconvenience that attends a coach how often one would want the harnessmaker smith and wheelwright how much one depends upon the health of horses and the conduct of a coachman and what risque one runs of being overset together with the fatal consequences which luxury too frequently occasions  truly polydore i do not grieve that i am obliged to used my legs which certainly will last me long enough but see the sun is now set and we must think of getting home before the evening closes on us let me have your hand  now are you not quite pleased in having seen my great estate   polydore ah dear papa i should be much more so could i but be persuaded that it were yours  the father smiled at this reply and down the hill they walked together as it happened they went by a meadow which at first they thought had been a pond because it was quite covered with water bless me cried out mr sage do you see this meadow how it is overflowed the neighboring river must have burst its bounds and all the hay this year is spoiled   polydore i fancy he to whom the hay belonged will not be very happy when they tell him of his loss   mr sage no no nor yet is this the worst he will be forced to mend the banks and very likely make another dam why he will be very happy if he does not spend in these repairs the produce of ten harvests that he could make in such a meadow   polydore oh what a misfortune   mr sage but i thought there had been a windmill hereabouts   polydore and there is papa look there before you   mr sage right i see it now the reason is i did not hear it going i would lay any wager that the torrent coming down has forced away the wheelwork let us go see  just so  it is broke to pieces  what will the poor owner do he must be very rich indeed to stand against so many lsses   polydore on i pity him with all my heart but since the cy is over pray why are the bricklayers still at work   mr sage i cannot tell why we need but ask the reason pray friend be so kind as to inform us why you work so late   a bricklayer we shall be here all night for yesterday when it was dark a gang of thieves pulled down the wall that they might get into the park and steal away the furniture that had been put into a new built summer house the theft was not discovered till this morning and indeed it is very lucky that no one caught them in the fact   mr sage how so   the bricklayer because the thieves had previously disposed combustibles to set the summer house on fire if they had been disturbed in plundering so that they might get away assisted by the bustle and confusion which such destruction would have caused the owner of this ground as you may judge is therefore very happy in his loss he might have seen his summer house burnt down whereas the affair will cost him now no more than some slight repairs to his wall the expense of keeping up a watch all night and buying other furniture instead of the former which indeed had cost him a good deal  well polydore now said mr sage to his son when they had walked a little way in silence what do you observe on these misfortunes do not they grieve you   polydore why should i be sorry i have suffered nothing by them   mr sage but if this estate had been your property as mr nortons grounds are his and if when going out this morning you had seen your meadow overflowed your windmill broken to pieces your park wall demolished and your summer house robbed would you have gone home as satisfied as you appear to be at present   polydore oh by no means i should on the contrary be miserable had i undergone so many heavy losses in a day   mr sage but what if you had every day such losses to endure or to dread would you be as happy as at present   polydore i should be a thousand times more miserable   mr sage well then polydore such is in reality the state of all who possess great abundance without reckoning up the cares that agitate them and the innumerable wants which they fancy  in the elevation of their fortune lies too frequently the cause of its decay a barren season or a false step in the pursuit of their rapacious projects frequently suffices to produce their ruin as they fear the loss of their imaginary consequence should they resolve upon some sacrifices to their luxury and pride the more they undergo distressing losses the more they suppose that they ought to make a sumptuous show to keep up the appearance of their riches and support a credit which already totters to its fall what then is the effect of such a wretched sort of vanity their servants perhaps kept out of their wages an unseasonable time proceed to introduce a sort of robbery through all the house the improvement of their fortune and the education of their children being overlooked their lands in some sort as it were lie fallow or produce a blighted harvest only and their children left to riot in the ways of wickedness commit disgraceful actions which are stified by the necessary aid of money all their property when seized by inexorable creditors is in the end completely dissipated or else the law lays hold of what would otherwise be left them and these favorites of fortune once so proud of their abundance elevated station and enjoyments fall at once to the lowest pitch of indigence shame anpair   polydore oh what a frightful picture is this papa   mr sage it is one however daily to be seen in society and be ssured there is not one exaggerated feature in the whle portrait i can at all times show you in the public papers the decy of some great family or other and these striking instances gods providence exposes to the observation of the rich that they may see what fortune is most likely to await their pride and folly in the morning we will go and gaze on those fine buildings which excite your envy now where you may read the ruin of too many families inscribed on every pillar round about till they are swallowed up themselves in their own ruin why alas can i not spare your sensibility the cries of many desolated families which are but too evincing tokens of such miserable revolutions   polydore what then should i look upon the mediocrity of our condition as a blessing meant us from above   mr sage yes yes if you are only frugal and industrious and possess sufficient resolution to renounce ambition and the immoderate wish of getting money of confining your desires and keeping them within the limits of that state you fill do i want any thing to make me happy and in reason would you wish hereafter to be happier than your father is consider the whole universe as your estate since if you are but properly industrious it will furnish you a comfortable maintenance gods providence has placed your earthly habitation half way up a hill whose summit is extremely craggy and its base choked up with swamps lift up your eye at intervals upon the rich and great not with a view to envy them their situations but to think upon the storms that bellow round them sometimes too look down upon the poor beneath you not by way of insult on their friendless situation but to hold them out your hand if god should bless you with a family of children let them often hear the lesson which i have just now taught you but particularly give them in your life and manners that example which gods blessing has enabled me to afford you  by this time they were both at home the virtuous mr sage went up stairs into his chamber and there falling on his knees gave thanks to god for all the blessings which he had constantly received and offered him the sacrifice of his existence as the best return that he could make what need had he of being any longer upon earth his days had been replete with probity and honor and by giving such a lesson on contentment to his son he endeavored as far as in him lay to endow him with a valuable patrimony such as no one could take from him   blindmans buff a drama in two acts characters mr jephson frank his son lucy his daughters isabel a his daughters dorinda their friends alice their friends laura a little lame their friends elder danby friends to frank younger danby who stutters friends to frank roberts their acquaintance mr jephsons groom scene an apartment in the house of mr jephson with a table and upon it books and other papers and a speaking trumpet in the corner  act i scene i frank speaking to his father as he goes down stairs no no papa do not be afraid i will tal the greatest care that no accident shall happen to your papers i will put up your books too in the closet  he comes for ward jumping for joy we shall have some fine diversion when the out is away the mice it is said will play to lucy who now comes in well now lucy is mama gone out and all our little friends arrived   lucy my friends are all three come but none of your companions yet   frank o i can easily believe you sister we do not want to run a gadding like you girls and so we are not the first to keep appointments of this nature you must force us from our study if you would have us look you i would lay any wager that the danbys at least are hard at work while we are speaking   lucy yes to settle what fine tricks they can contrive to put upon us  but pray frank is it true that papa will let us pass the evening here our room above is so very small we could not have found room to turn ourselves well round   frank could my papa refuse you any thing when i concerned myself to ask it softly little girl do not discompose the papers  let them he   lucy keep that advice sir to yourself i meant to lay them smooth   frank with an air of importance no no you cannot miss i am charged with that commission   lucy truly my papa could not have given it to so orderly a gentleman let me at least assist you then and afterward i will put the chairs in order these great books i shall remove first   frank do not think of touching them at most i can permit you only to take one by one and pile them up upon my hands she does so till they reach his chin   lucy there is enough   frank aning backwards one more only  so  i have no sufficient for one turn  he takes a step or two when all the books fall down lucy bing out a laughing ha ha ha ha there there they g those handsome books that papa would never let us toh i fancy he will be greatly pleased to see them all tbled together thus   frank i  lost the other of gravity as my tutor says and you know he is gravity itself he picks the books up but they tumble down as fast as he gathers them deuce take it they have been at sadlers wells i think and learned to tumble sure   lucy you will never finish if i do not assist you so do you see i will spread my apron and do you stoop down and pile them in it   frank that is well thought indeed frank goes upon his knees takes up the books and places them in order in his sisters apron   lucy softly brother they will rub one against another so i have got them all and now i will carry them into the closet she goes out   frank rising out of breath bless me i should never do to live a long time in the country where men go upon allfours like monkies he fans himself with his hat   lucy reentering could you see how neatly i have ranged them on the chimney you would be charmed so let me have the rest frank puts the other books and all the papers in his sisters lap who says when she receives them well every body must acknowledge that girls are cleverer than boys   frank o yes and you particularly isabella is constantly employed in putting by your shreds and rags   lucy and if your tutor had not constantly his eye upon you you would never know where you should find your exercises and translations she looks about her but i fancy i have now got them all   frank yes yes there is nothing left so get you gone lucy goes out   frank putting back the chairs and table in their places there so that is done and we shall now have elbowroom enough i cannot help thinking what fine work we shall be sure to make however i am surprised that they are not come yet for my part i can say i hardly ever make any one wait for me when a visit is in the case   lucy entering once again and looking round about ay very well but brother you must hide this speaking trumpet if your friends should happen to perceive it they will be sure to stun us with their noise   frank stay stay i will put it up behind the door as perhaps i shall want it let your little friends come now and din me with their chattering as they used to do and we shall see who will cry out loudest   lucy pshaw we need but join together we should very shortly get the upper hand of such a little thing as you   frank o no for if you ladies have your clappers so well hung we gentlemen possess a fine clear manly voice which every one respects as thus  you hear me   lucy shrugging up her shoulders yes and have so much respect as you say for you that i will take myself away farewell i will run and join my friends   frank and bid the servant send me up my visitors when they arrive   lucy yes yes she withdraws   frank taking up the speaking trumpet here is what has often brought me from the furthest corner of the garden much against my inclination and i think i hear it still  so ho there frank frank  my young friends live only at the corner of the street let me see if i can hurry them he puts the trumpet to his mouth throws up the window and cries out girls and boys come out to play the moon does shine as bright as day come with a whoop and come with a call come with good will or not at all he leaves the window and draws near the door well is not this surprising it is like harlequins enchanted here i think i hear them talking to each other on the stairs he listens yes yes i protest the two danbys he puts the trumpet by suppose i were to jump now on the table and receive them sitting on my throne he runs to fetch a stool that he may put it on the table and prepares to take a spring but the arrival of the two danbys prevents him   scene ii frank elder danby younger danby frank could not you have staid a little at the door till i was mounted on my throne that i might give you audience as they say in all my glory   elder danby good indeed you have no occasion for a throne to look exactly like a king and active as you are the throne might possibly cause your majesty a tumble   frank why to say the truth i have read of many tumbles of that nature in my ancient history   elder danby and in some sort such an accident has happened to my brother though he is no great prince he fell down stairs last week and hurt his nose considerably   younger danby stuttering yes indeedeed it pains me stistill a little and that maaaster roberts is a very nauauaughty boy   frank does he design to come tonight   elder danby i hope not if we had expected him here we should not have stirred out   younger danby he ooonly thinks of mismischief   frank what has he done then   elder danby we were both going out last saturday i stopped to get a handkerchief my brother went down stairs alone and as it happened roberts hearing some one came out slily jumped at once upon my brother who was frighted lost his footing and rolled down the stairs from top to bottom   frank poor danby i am sorry for you roberts looks for all the world as if he loved such mischief we shall have his company this evening for the first time in our lives his father begged papa to let him come and see us   elder danby i am sorry for it for we do not speak to one another   frank my papa supposed you all good friends because you lodge together and considered that you would have the greater pleasure if he came   elder danby the greater pleasure we should like to have him ten miles off since he has been our neighbor we are continually uneasy he has frequently amused himself with breaking windows and then tried to lay the blame on us   frank does no one make complaint about him to his father   elder danby oh i do not know what to make of him he is such an odd sort of a man he scolds a little pays the damage and that is all   frank if i were your papa i would quit my lodgings and live somewhere else   elder danby yes so he means to do and therefore yesterday gave warning and now we are forbidden all manner of connection with this roberts he is so wicked would you think it very few go by the house without being apprehensive that he will put some trick upon them sometimes he diverts himself by squirting puddle water at them or else pelting them with rotten apples nay he will sometimes fasten rabbits tails or bits of rags behind their backs at which the people when they see it all burst out a laughing then too he has what he calls his caxen fishery   frank caxen fishery   elder danby yes he will take the peoples wigs off as they pass him with a hook as you would carp when any poor man stops before his window to converse with an acquaintance roberts immediately goes up to the balcony with a string suspended from a fishingrod and at the end of it a hook with which he jerks the poor mans wig off then he runs and ties it to a dog that he has before provided for the purpose after which he drives the creature out into the street and off he sets that instant so that the poor perriwig has frequently been dragged for twenty minutes through the mud before its owner can lay hold of it again   frank but this is more than mere amusement   elder danby and yet this is nothing to the stories that i could tell you why he lames or bruises all the dogs and cats that come within his reach nor is it long ago when one of his relations broke a leg by slipping down upon the stairs where roberts had been scattering peace on purpose ay it is so or else our name is not danby and for the servants i am sure his father would not get one to attend him if he did not pay extraordinary wages   frank shall i tell you now i long to see him i like boys a little merry   elder danby nothing is more natural but robertss mirth is not like other childrens you i know love laughing in your heart but would not for the world hurt any one whereas this wicked fellow laughs at bumps and bruises   frank oh that does not fright me in the least i shall be much more pleased in paying him as he deserves   elder danby if he should come my brother will not offend you by withdrawing he would do him some fresh mischief   younger danby yeyeyes i will go   frank no no we are old friends and positively no new comer shall divide us i will take care and manage him i warrant you  but do not i hear a noise upon the stairs  it is roberts  no i see my sister and her company   scene iii frank elder danby younger danby lucy isabella dorinda alice laura lucy your humble servant my good friends but why not seated brother you might easily have got the gentlemen a chair apiece since they have been with you sure there has been time enough   frank as if we did not know that it is usual to stand up when we receive ladies   lucy i am charmed to find you know your duty but where is master roberts to the danbys i did suppose that you would have brought him with you   elder danby it is a long time now thank heaven since we have been separated from him   dorinda is he then unlukier than lucys brother   laura archly certainly he would be unlucky then indeed   alice lucys brother he is a very lamb to roberts we have known him for a long time have we not dear sister   laura we have and he has played me many a trick   alice he was very intimate with anthony my brother but he is rid of him entirely now why he is the saddest fellow in the world   lucy oh as for that my brother is even with him there   dorinda but to do mischief merely for the pleasure of it  there is the villainy   lucy no no my brother is better than that comes to   frank with an air of irony do you really think so i am obliged to you   dorinda well well my dear lucy we will be under your protection you are the biggest of us and besides at present you are mistress of the house and may command him   lucy do not you be afraid i will keep him perfectly in bounds   frank yes yes lucy you shall take care of the ladies and for you to the danbys i will take you under my protection   elder danby oh he will hardly think of playing tricks with me he knows me i assure you i only fear for my brother   younger danby he makes gagagame of me yes alalalways   laura that is his way he always attacks the least he would never vex my sister  none but me   lucy i can believe you such as he are always cowards i compare him to a puppy following close upon a cat as long as she keeps running but if once the cat turns round and shows her whiskers then the puppy scampers for it   frank well then sister you shall be the cat   laura and let him see your whiskers   lucy but methinks it would not be amiss if we sat down though we expect this mr mischiefmaker we have no need i fancy to remain standing up till he chooses to appear   frank hush here he is   scene iv frank elder danby younger danby lucy isabella dorinda alice laura roberts roberts to frank and his sister making them a bow your servant your papa was pleased to let me wait upon you so i am come to spend the evening with you   lucy we are glad to see you and shall have a deal of pleasure in your company at least my brother   isabelia yes indeed he wants for good example   frank do i so your good example you would have the gentleman suppose is not sufficient   lucy well a truce to compliments as mistress of the house it is necessary that i should let you know who is who this tall young lady in the first place is miss dorinda lambton   roberts with a banter i am charmed to hear it   lucy and these are the miss    roberts o i know them very well this here is pointing to alice my lady  what is her name pentweazle that will take you off the company as simple as she seems and there is pointing to laura and limping round the room miss upanddown who broke her leg by running from the rod this gentleman elder danby observe him he is a grave wise grecian who looks strait before him when he walks as if he pitied us poor silly children and this other good little friend of mine pointing to younger danby and letting fall his hat is pepepeter grievous whose dear mama forgot poor creature to untie his tongue when he was born the children seem surprised and stare at one another   frank and who am i sir for methinks you seem quite clever at this sort of portrait painting   roberts oh i am not sufficiently acquainted with you yet to take your likeness but i shall let you have it soon   lucy for you sir i could draw you at a glance and i must tell you the similitude would not be very pleasing i could never have supposed it possible that any well bred little gentleman as i imagine you affect to be should think of turning natural defects into a theme for banter if my little friends were not sincerely such they would have reason to reproach me for exposing them to your indecency but they can see that i could not have expected half so much myself   roberts why frank i protest your sister is mighty eloquent you need not go to church on sundays having such a charming preacher in the house   frank she has tolerable skill when any one is to be told the truth and therefore both my sister isabella and i love her sincerely   roberts well well you see i have tolerable skill likewise in telling truth and therefore no doubt you will love me too sincerely he bows to lucy i ask your pardon miss for having taken your employment out of your hands as you are yourself so clever at it   lucy your excuses and your bow are both an insult but an insult such as i despise though were they on the other hand sincere they would hardly make atonement for so coarse an incivility if i had not considered every word that you said as meant in joke however gross i cannot but suppose it i should know what suited me to do and should have done it likewise let me therefore beg sir that you will indulge in no more freedoms of this nature if you mean that we should remain together   roberts somewhat embarrassed well but i see you do not understand a little harmless piece of banter let us be friends he  out his hand   lucy giving hers with all my heart sir but provided    roberts turning his back suddenly upon lucy and addressing young danby you are an honest little fellow too and i will shake hands with you he hesitates to give his hand and therefore roberts seizing on it shakes his arm so roughly that he falls a crying   elder danby master roberts   frank laying hold of robertss arm pray sir let this child alone or    roberts well  or what  my little jackadandy   frank laly i am little i acknowledge but yet strong enough and so you will find me when my friends require to be defended   roberts say you so in that case i should like to be one of them but beforehand if you please we will have a brush just to see how you will be able to defend them   roberts on a  tries to fling him down but frank stands his gnd and roberts falls the company rush in to part them frank but one moment if you please young ladies i will not do him any harm well mr roberts pray how do you find yourself i fancy i am your master   roberts struggling take your knee off  or you will stifle me   frank no no you must not think of getting up unless you first ask pardon   roberts furiously pardon   frank yes sir and of all the company as you have certainly offended all the company   roberts well well i do ask pardon   frank if you should insult us again be assured we will send you down into the cellar till tomorrow morning which will surely cool your courage that is much better than to hurt you we do not think you worth the trouble  rise he gets from off him and when both are up continues you have no right to be offended for remember it was yourself began the contest roberts seems ashamed   dorinda aside to isabella i could never have supposed your brother half so valiant   isabella oh a lion is hardly bolder and yet dorinda he never quarrels he is in short although i say it the best tempered little fellow in the world to the company but what are we doing we ought to think of some amusement for the evening   frank certainly we ought or why are we all come together well what play shall we choose something funny what say you danby   elder danby we will let the ladies choose   roberts makes mouths at frank and danby the rest pretend as if they did not see him lucy there frank there is a lesson for you we may choose well then suppose we play at questions and commands or possibly you would like a game at cards much better   laura i should rather play at something with the least danby if you have a picturebook we will turn it over shall we   younger danby o oooh yes yes   lucy with all my heart sweet dears i will carry you up stairs you will neither want for pictures nor playthings there   laura and the younger danby take hold of one another by the hand and jump for joy lucy to the ladies my friends will you go with me for amusement into my apartment i have a charming bonnet that you will like to see   all together yes yes yes let us go   elder danby will you accept my hand as far as your apartment miss lucy   lucy rather let miss dorinda or alice have it if they please   the elder danby presents his hand to alice who happens to stand next him roberts what then do you mean to leave me by myself here   frank no sir these young ladies will excuse me so i shall stay but i am obliged to leave you for a moment   roberts are you but i will follow you i do not like to be left alone by night and in a house where i am a stranger   act ii scene i frank roberts roberts the truth is i was apprehensive lest you might think of playing me some trick so i accompanied you but now that we are returned and all alone we may devise some mirth between us   frank very willingly i ask no better so let us think a little   roberts we must have some fun i fancy with the younger danby   frank if by fun you mean some trick to hurt him i say no i will not be in a joking humor so pray leave him out if you are bent on mischief   roberts they told me that you were always merry and fond of something funny   frank and so i am but notwithstanding without hurt to any one however let me know what sort of fun you meant   roberts look you here are two large needles i will stick them both with the points upward in the bottom of two chairs that common eyes shall not discern them in the next place you shall offer two of these young ladies the two chairs for very likely they would suspect that i meant them mischief of some sort or other and they will naturally both sit down but figure to yourself what strange grimaces they will both make ha ha ha ha it makes me die a laughing when i barely think what faces we shall see them put on ay ay and your prudish sister too will find the matter quite diverting   frank but suppose i were to treat you just in the same manner would you like it   roberts oh treat me that is different but those little idiots    frank so you call them idiots do you since they are not mischievous   roberts well you are mighty formal and precise then shall i mention something else   frank yes do   roberts then i have some thread as strong as whipcord in my pocket i will thread one of these great needles with a little of it and as soon as they are all come down one of us shall go up politely toward them make a deal of scraping and wry faces while the other keeping still behind shall sew their gowns together they will all want to dance as you may guess so up we will come and take them out  ha ha you know the rest ha ha ha ha ha   frank yes to tear their gowns and get them anger when their parents find it out   roberts why there is the fun   frank what have you no pleasure then in any thing but doing mischief   roberts but it does not hurt me   frank o ho i understand you think of no one but yourself and all the world is nothing to you   roberts well but we are come together to divert ourselves and we must positively have some laughing so suppose we frighten laura and the least danby   frank but that is quite wrong supposing any one should frighten you   roberts with all my heart if any one is but able i am afraid of nothing   frank aside say you so  that we shall see perhaps  aloud to roberts well about this frightening   roberts i have an ugly mask at home i will run and fetch it and do you when i am gone contrive to bring the little children down and you shall see  i will not be absent half a minute   frank aside good  there shall be a better mask ready for you though  to roberts calling him back but roberts roberts   roberts what is the matter   frank it will be better that we should come upon them where we are if i can bring the others down for when there are but two or three in this part of the house there sometimes comes a spirit and in that case we ourselves should be but badly off   roberts what is all this story of a spirit   frank nay it is true at first one hears a noise and then a phantom with a lighted torch glides by and then the room seems all on fire he draws back as if afraid oh methinks i see it now   roberts a little frightened see what  o dear  and what can bring the phantom here   frank drawing roberts toward a corner and then whispering to him the reason as we are told is this there was a miser who lived here formerly and he was robbed one night of all his money in despair he cut his throat and now from time to time his ghost goes up and down    roberts in a tremble o ho i will stay no longer here unless you get more company   frank but recollect how brave you were just now   roberts you must not fancy i am afraid  but  but  but  but  but i will go and fetch my mask   frank do do and i will prepare things here  what pleasure we shall have   roberts with a grin oh enough to make one die with laughing   frank they will be finely frightened   roberts that they will and therefore i will make haste i am at home and back again  you shall see how soon he goes out   frank alone ah ah you want to frighten others and are not afraid yourself well well i have thought of something that will frighten you or i am very much mistaken   scene ii frank lucy isabella dorinda alice elder danby lucy we saw master roberts run across the street this moment what is the matter have you had a quarrel   frank on the contrary he thinks me his best friend i have seemed willing to go shares with him in a trick that he means to put upon the little ones above but it is himself that he will trick and never wish to come here a third time   lucy well what is your project   frank you shall know very soon at present i have no time to lose for every thing must be in readiness against his coming back so ladies i request permission to be absent for about five minutes   dorinda yes go go but do not stay longer we are all impatient to be told what you design   frank i shall consider it my duty to inform you when i have finished my preparations so once more with your leave i will come again in less perhaps than five minutes he goes out   lucy ah ah ah  two pretty fellows together we shall see what good comes out between them they are well matched   elder danby oh for heavens sake miss lucy do not do such dishonor to my friend your brother as to name him and that wicked roberts together   alice you are in the right dauby one is nothing but politeness and the other quite a savage   isabella savage as he is however i would lay a wager that frank will be found his master   dorinda what a piece of service frank would do us could he clear the house of such a fellow we shall have no pleasure all the evening if he stays among us   lucy i am afraid however frank will proceed too far and think himself permitted to do any thing against this roberts   elder danby he can never do enough and though his scheme should be a little hard on roberts there will be instruction in it it is the greatest service that one can do him and his father i am persuaded will be pleased with frank when he hears what pains he has taken to instruct his son alas he would part with half his fortune to have roberts like him   alice so lucy do not you go about to thwart your brothers good intentions   lucy but my dear miss alice i am in a ticklish situation i am now instead of my mama and cannot possibly let any thing go forward that she would not approve   alice let him have his way we will take the blame of what he does upon ourselves   isabella yes let him sister war i say war war for ever with the wicked   frank returning joyfully  i have settled every thing and roberts may appear whenever he thinks proper we will receive him   lucy but i hope you will tell me    dorinda yes we will be in the plot too and more than that assist you if we can   frank no ladies that is not necessary there is a little violence i must acknowledge in my plot and therefore i will not make you parties i have been settling every thing with ralph in the stable he conceives my meaning clearly and will second it with great dexterity   lucy but still you do not acquaint me    frank this is all of the contrivance that you need know we will go to blindmans buff that roberts may suspect no harm on his return i will let myself be caught and he or she that blinds me must take care that i may have an opportunity of seeing through the handkerchief and fixing upon roberts after he is blinded you shall steal into the closet take away the lights and leave us both together when i want your aid i will call you   elder danby but if roberts should proceed to thrash you in your tete a tete   frank proceed to thrash me you observed how easily i flung him down i am not afraid of such a one as he for i have found him to be nothing but a coward so that is fixed but first we must have both the little ones down stairs or roberts might go up and frighten them while we are talking here together so pray sister to isabella go and bring them down   isabella yes yes she goes out   lucy but brother i am not clear that i should permit you    alice what is the matter let him do i tell you as he pleases   frank yes yes sister and rely on my discretion you are sensible i do not like mischief for the sake of mischief therefore he shall not have half the punishment that he merits but come off when i have frightened him a little and that is all the harm that i mean to do him   lucy well then frank on your promise of discretion    frank yes i promise you no less so let us make haste and put the things to rights that all may be in order here too when he comes  they put away the chairs and table isabella in the mean time comes down with laura and younger danby   frank going up to laura and younger danby  come come my little friends into this closet but take care and do not make any noise or roberts very possibly will hear you   isabella i will conduct them there is a book of pictures in it and i will stay to show them whatever they like   laura i thought the tea was ready may we not stay here with you till it comes in   frank i shall fetch you when the servant brings it but at present you must go into the closet roberts wants to frighten you and i will not let him   younger danby yeyeyes let us go my dededear isabella takes up a candle and goes in with laura and younger danby   frank we comprehend i suppose what we are to do my eyes not wholly covered and whenever i may give the signal you must take away the light and get into the closet but particularly a perfect silence   dorinda yes we understand you   frank i believe i hear a noise hush hush hush he listens at the door  yes yes it is he it is he be quick let one of you be blinded   dorinda i will begin who

into your way   roberts brings a chair and puts it so that dorinda may tumble over it but frank takes the chair away and puts himself instead upon his hands and feet with so much noise that dorinda may hear him as she slides along her feet as if at bazard she encounters frank stoops and seizes him dorinda after having felt about his cape and wrists and seeming doubtful it is master frank   frank in appearance disconcerted  yes indeed i am taken what ill luck so soon   dorinda pulling off the bandage  o ho you wanted to throw me down i thought nobody but master roberts played such tricks but it shall not be long before i take revenge she covers franks eyes but so that he can see a little leads him toward the middle of the room and then as is the custom of the game asks him  how many horses in your fathers stable   frank three black white and gray   dorinda turn about three times and catch whom you may   frank gropes his way from place to place and lets himself be jostled as they please miss dorinda particularly plagues him he pretends to follow her but all at once turns round and falls on roberts frank ah ha i have caught you have i it is a boy it is roberts pulling off the handkerchief yes yes i am not mistaken   roberts whispering frank why lay hold on me   frank whispering roberts do not mind it you shall catch danby i will push him toward you   roberts whispering frank do and you shall see how i will make him squeak i will pinch him till the very blood comes   frank begins to cover robertss eyes and gives his company a nod as he had settled it elder danby assisted by the little ladies takes away the lights and all together run into an adjoining closet without making any noise elder danby just before he steps into the closet well have you finished oh make haste you take a deal of time what mischief are you whispering to each other   at this instant the groom presents himself at the door he has a lighted torch in one hand and a stick beneath it in the other with a large fullbottomed wig upon it he is covered head and all with mr jephsons gown which trails along upon the ground behind him frank beckons him to stay a little at the entrance while he is bding roberts frank putting roberts in the middle of the room how many horses in your fathers stable   roberts three black white and gray   frank turn about  pretending to be angry with the others be quiet pray young ladies and not quit your places till the game is begun  turn about three times and catch whom you may  the ghost the ghost run roberts for your life  he claps the door to violently hides himself behind the grown and speaking through the trumpet says it is you then that come to steal my treasure   roberts trembling with fear and not daring to pull off the bandage fie fire danby where are you frank murder murder dorinda   frank speaking through the trumpet i have scared them all away  pull off your bandage and look at me   roberts without pulling off the bandage puts both hands before his face retiring as the ghost advances on him frank pull it off i say    roberts makes shift to pull the bandage down which falis about his neck he dares not lift his eyes up but at last when he chserves the ghost be screams out and has not power to move frank i know you well your name is roberts   roberts hearing this runs up and down to get away he finds the door shut fast falls down upon his knees holds out his hands and turns away his head frank what you think to escape me do you   roberts after several efforts i have done nothing to you you were never robbed by me   frank never robbed by you you are capable of any villainy who squirts at people in the street who fastens rabbits tails behind their backs who fishes for their wigs who lames poor dogs and cats who sticks up pins in chairs to prick his friends when they sit down and who has in his pocket even now a mask to frighten two poor little children   roberts i have done all this indeed i own it but for heavens sake pardon me and i will not do so any more   frank who will answer for you   roberts those that you have frightened away if you will but call them   frank do you promise me yourself   roberts yes yes upon my honor   frank well then i take pity on you but remember had it been my pleasure i might easily fly away with you through the window   here the phantom shakes his torch which gives a glare like lightning and then goes out roberts almost swooning with terror falls down on his face scene the last roberts frank the groom mr jephson mr jephson entering with a candle in his hand what is all this disturbance   roberts without looking up it is not i that make it pray pray do not come near me   mr jephson perceiving roberts on the ground who can this be on the ground   roberts you know me well enough and have already taken pity on me   mr jephson i already taken pity on you   roberts it was not i that robbed you   mr jephson robbed me what does all this mean do not i know you master roberts    roberts yes yes that is my name good ghost so pray do not hurt me   mr jephson i am astonished why in such a posture he puts down the light holds out his hand and lifts him up   roberts struggling first of all but knowing mr jephson afterward mr jephson is it you his features brighten he is gone then is he he looks round about him sees the ghost and turns away again there there he stands  the phantom  dont you see him   frank brings the children from the closet laura and younger danby are frightened at the grooms appearance but the rest burst out a laughing mr jephson well what signifies all this   frank coming forward let me explain the whole papa this phantom is your groom and we have put on him your wig and gown   the groom letting fall his disguise yes sir it is i   mr jephson an odd sort of sport this frank   frank true but ask the company if master roberts has not well deserved to be thus frightened he designed to frighten laura and danby i only wished to hinder him let him but show the frightful mask that he has about him   mr jephson to roberts is this true   roberts giving him the mask i cannot deny it here it is sir   mr jephson you have met with nothing then but what you deserve   dorinda we persuaded miss lucy to permit her brother to make use of this device in order to punish roberts   alice if you knew besides sir all the other tricks that he meant to play us    mr jephson what sir is this the sample that you give us of your behavior the first time you set foot withinmy doors you have been disrespectful to me in the person of my children who were pleased with the expectation of having you as their guest you have been disrespectful to these ladies whom i need not say you should have honored and regarded so be gone your father when he comes to know that you have been thus turned out of doors will see how necessary it is to correct the vices of your heart i will not permit your detestable example to corrupt my children go and never let me see you here again roberts is confounded and withdraws and you my friends although the circumstances of the case may very possibly excuse what you have done yet never for the time to come indulge yourselves in such a sport the fears which have power to affect children at a tender age may possibly be followed by the worst consequences during their whole life avenge yourselves upon the wicked only by behaving better and remember after the example which master roberts has afforded you that by intending harm to others you will oftenest bring it down upon yourselves
