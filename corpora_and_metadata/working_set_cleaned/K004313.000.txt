properties of the various kinds of food and shown how far they agree or disagree with different constitutions we proceed now according to our promise in order to complete this treatise upon health to consider exercise rest excretions etc for let us ever be so observant of the former unless we pay a careful attention to these we shall not be able to keep ourselves well we shall treat of them therefore in their turns and we will begin with  exercise now in the human system there is a certain quantity only of living power that can be produced for the health of the body so that if we exhaust that power we debilitate or weaken the body a man for example may walk till he can walk no longer it is therefore necessary to know how far exercise is salutary but let us first consider the great benefits procured by it  exercise increases the natural heat of the body and thus excites and dilates the spirits making them far more vigorous and active  it empties the stomach and promotes the appetite for the next meal for as in sedentary habits digestion does not quite clear the stomach but leaves part of the food which often clogs and disturbs it exercise will excite this to pass away and the stomach being thus discharged of those relicts the appetite sharpens and craves food very strongly this naturally strengthens the powers of the stomach and we digest our next meal better  it also excites an expulsion of excrements not suffering any superfluous matter to lodge in the body  it likewise opens the pores and gives a free perspiration which too much rest will shut up nature has appointed these vents and secret ways of evacuation to cleanse the habit of the body which in a little time would be clogged and become very foul and impure by an accumulation of superfluous humors  it in the last place promotes and adds greatly to the nutrition of the body we find by experience that active stirring people have a fresher countenance a greater flow of spirits nay their flesh is firmer and their limbs stronger than what is generally met with in persons that lead a sedentary idle and sluggish life for it is a maxim universally known and received that a frequent exertion of the original powers in any one part of the body tends to strengthen that part for example the legs of a dancer shall be strong and lusty when his arms shall be weak and small and the arms of a blacksmith or waterman shall be muscular and powerful while their legs shall fall away the reason of this is very evident exercise circulates the blood and nutritive juices gives them a free passage to all parts of the limbs so exercised and drives off all superfluous humors that without it would be destructive but  such exercise is to be chosen as suits best with the nature of each persons body some requiring exercise of the upper parts most others of the lower parts and some equally of both but that is generally most advantageous that exercises every part as dancing fencing riding tennis ringing etc  now whatever be our exercise those whom good fortune has enabled to take it or not would do well to attend to the following observations  exercise should be daily in the morning always with an empty stomach and if possible after excremental evacuation for the heat of the body opening the vessels may otherwise draw foul humors into the blood and occasion very dangerous obstructions for this reason it is not so well to take any extraordinary exercise upon a full stomach or till the intestines are clear though any great exercise after meals is injurious to walk gently is exceedingly wholesome for bo this means our food will descend to the bottom of the stomach the natural heat of the body will be increased and digestion will go on the better where persons can retire after meals into the sweet air and such delightful places as exhilerate the spirits it is right to do it if the state of the body be such as that we cannot walk after meals it will be right to stand up at least according to the old verse post pastum stabis passu mollive meabisthat is stand up after meals or walk gently   exercise should be varied according to your constitution and the season of the year young strong robust persons in cold weather admit of greater exercise old weak and thin persons in hot weather of less for the fatter and grosser the body is so much the more is the natural heat diminished and exercise more necessary to dissolve the superfluous moisture of the body which occasions grossness and to increase the circulation of the blood circulation being naturally brisker in the summer exercise is less needful but more so in the winter as the moisture of the season will sometimes occasion obstructions in the lungs and breast which strong and laborious motion will often remove  exercise opening the pores we should be careful not to use it in a damp air lest we take in some of its noxious qualities that may do us harm neither should we expose the body after it lest we catch cold but these things are so well known that they need not be further explained  another necessary caution to be observed is that exercise be not too violent nor continued longer than it is a pleasure but that we desist before we be weary or sweat too much  those who from age or infirmities are unable to take exercise should rub their bodies morning and evening with flannel or coarse linen gloves all parts may be rubbed except the stomach and belly rubbing these will disturb digestion and offend the head we may apply a warm cloth to them in the room of it the loins of the back likewise should not be rubbed unless we feel them cold and then but gently lest they should be overheated and obstructions in the urinary passages should ensue in this operation we should begin softly and easily increasing the motion and weight of our hand as the tenderness of the skin will permit till the flesh as it were swell and be somewhat ruddy and then desist for too much rubbing will bring on an inflammation was every person well or ill to rub themselves in this manner once or twice a day for a little while they would never omit it for they would find themselves glow with a natural warmth their limbs would be active and their joints supple it is for this reason that children are rubbed who can take no exercise and experience teaches us that the currying and rubbing a horse notwithstanding his exercise is a great addition to his health in cold and moist seasons the head also should be rubbed with a coarse linen cloth warmed  thus having set out the times for exercise and motion let us proceed to consider  rest rest is as necessary to preserve health and continue us in strength and vigor as exercise when the body is fatigued rest is refreshing and renews its strength but when satiated with rest it thirsts again for motion and agreeable exercise rest is a burden if forced upon nature longer than it requires interdum quies inquieta est says seneca even rest sometimes is irksome for if exercise is necessary for the preservation of health too much inactivity must be prejudicial ignavia corpus hebetat labor firmat sluggishness makes the mind and body dull and heavy whereas frequent motion strengthens and invigorates them  the life of man conversant in change spends its whole course in sleep and watching the one appointed for rest and ease the other for action and labor if he was constant in the first his life would be only the shadow of death if in the last he would soon be exhausted nature therefore has wisely contrived that man should not long continue in either but wear out his life between the two  sleep is a placid state of body and mind giving refreshment and ease to both for as an exertion of the faculties either of mind or body exhausts our powers rest will restore those powers the powers of the mind are like a small current which is sufficient to keep up a continual motion if we want to give this water greater power we dam it up and when the water is run from the dam if we wish to produce a fresh power equal to the first we shut the sluices and collect the water again so it is with the mind in sleep in perfect sleep both the body and mind are at rest excepting in those particulars where an exertion is necessary to life and in sleep it is that the body receives a greater degree of nutrition it is then digestion takes place in an extraordinary degree and recruits those spirits that were exhausted in the course of the preceding day  now that sleep may prove advantageous answering the intentions and designs of nature let us consider four things concerning it the time when it should be taken the necessary limits or quantity of sleep required the salubrity of the place and the position of the body  the time most proper for sleep is according to the appointment of nature the night when creation in general take its rest at the shutting up of the day when the sun gets below the horizon the spirits are not so active and lively but incline to a cessation it is then they return to the center of the body and apply themselves to what is called concoction that is they return to perform their vital operations to nourish and refresh the system for during the heat of the day they are dilated and extended to the external or circumferent parts hence we find that toward midnight unless we are in exercise put on another garment or increase the heat of the room we always find ourselves chilly in the morning again at the rising of the sun our spirits are naturally fresh brisk and active if we therefore prevert the order of nature turn day into night by keeping late hours and laying in bed all the morning we do that which is greatly destructive to our constitution for as sleep naturally draws the animal heat inwards and the heat of the sun counteracts this power by drawing it outward sleeping in the day is a resisting of nature which must be prejudicial to the health of the body sleeping in the day therefore is a bad custom particularly for fat corpulent people but if the spirits be fatigued with care or business or by reason of old age weakness of nature extreme hot weather labor or the like then moderate daysleep is a good refreshment but take it rather sitting than lying down because the head will be less offended with the rising vapors neither should it be taken immediately after dinner but an hour or half an hour after at least and between dinner and our nap it would be prudent to walk a little thus will our food descend better into the stomach and be less liable to affect the head neither should this afternoons nap be longer than half an hour or an hour at most lest the animal heat should be so collected from the outward parts as to cause a heaviness in the head neither should it be taken in a hot place but in one cool rather especially in summer time as shall hereafter be shown  sitting up late is one of the great destroyers of the constitution it tires and wastes the animal spirits by keeping them too long upon duty weakens nature hastens on the effects of old age changes a fresh florid countenance into a sallow one heats and dries the body breeds rheums and bad humors and is particularly injurious to thin people  by going early to asleep and early from it we rise refreshed lively and active sleeping late in the morning keeps that excrementitious matter in the intestines which ought to be evacuated and thus occasions obstructions and noisome vapors which greatly offend the head dull the senses and are very pernicious to the whole body if our necessities indeed oblige us to sit up late our supper should be little and we may make amends for it by laying an hour or two longer in the morning but let what will happen we should always be up by nine oclock  in order that sleep may be peaceable and refreshing we should be careful to go to bed with a free and quiet mind and banish the thoughts of all manner of care and business how often has a train of thinking disturbed a mans rest and kept him awake the whole night the body and the mind is recruited in proportion to the soundness also of sleep the more we dream the less are we refreshed although rest is not complete at the beginning it has a tendency to become so during this state of the body that is to a quiet mind sleep becomes sounder and sounder when a man first falls asleep he dreams tosses and tumbles about gradually he becomes more quiet and were we awake him he would not recollect that he had been dreaming at all or he would tell us he dreamed but in a small degree during sleep the original power appears to be so much accumulated as to give a disposition to action both to the mind and body from the slightest cause sleep then leaves us and we awake that is when the powers are recruited the organs begin to be affected and the man dreams afresh at last outward objects sensibly affect him and he awakes it is then the mind is fittest for action the judgment is then stronger the imagination more lively and as the evening comes on these powers are gradually diminished and require fresh sleep to recruit them  the next thing that falls under our consideration is the quantity of sleep we take this has been in some measure noticed but it may not be unnecessary to be a little more particular it cannot indeed be determined how long we may sleep as in all other things a mediocrity is best our sleep should be proportioned to our health our age the complexion and emptiness or fullness of the stomach  as the nutrition of the body is particularly assisted by sleep we should sleep in general till the food we take has performed its office that is till what physicians call concoction is completed this may be discerned on our awaking by the sensible lightness of the body especially the head the emptiness of the stomach and a certain desire of evacuation provided it is not unnaturally occasioned heaviness of the head and eyes or a taste of our last meal signify that we have not slept a sufficient length of time in short six seven or eight hours is long enough for young persons in health but such as are sickly and weak require longer rest nine ten or eleven hours children and old men require more sleep in general than young or middleaged persons children that their growth may the better be promoted and old men because it lessens the dryness of their constitution the same reason holds good with lean people to whom more sleep is necessary than to such as are fat for sleep moistens and refreshes the whole system in a word as immoderate sleep or sleep taken at improper times weakens the natural heat loads the head with vapors detains the excrements longer than is wholesome makes men sluggish and heavyheaded destroys the memory and subjects them to the palsy lethargy etc so too little sleep dries up the constitution dims the sight wastes the spirits and destroys all the powers and faculties both of mind and body it must be observed that we should not go to bed upon a full stomach that is not go to rest too soon after supper but continue up an hour or two till our food be half digested if we are obliged to sup late we should eat the less for on account of the natural heat of the body retiring inwards during the time of sleep a full stomach will occasion a superfluity of vapors and greatly offend the head besides great suppers are very apt to occasion heartburn which will of course deprive us of our rest  a matter occurs here whether it be beneficial or not to have our bed warmed persons in years such as are weak and those who lead a tender and delicate course of life do right to warm their beds in cold and moist seasons of the year and that for two reasons that the body on putting off our clothes may not be suddenly affected with the external cold and as the inward heat of the body is much assisted by the warmth of the bed concoction will be forwarded and the superfluous moisture of the body be the better consumed but this custom is unwholesome to those persons who are healthful and strong because it will very much weaken them  when we arise in the morning we should find it amply compensate for our trouble were we gently to rub our breasts and sides downward with our hands and the rest of our body more strongly with flannel or a hot linen cloth particularly our joints doing this will quicken the blood strengthen the parts and excite the natural heat when risen we should stretch ourselves out that the animal spirits may be dilated to the exterior parts of the body walk a little up and down that the remaining contents of the stomach may more speedily descend this done we should proceed to cleanse our nose by blowing it to clear our breast by expectoration and to make every other necessary evacuation we should wash and and plunge our eyes in cold water for this not only clears away the filth but strengthens and preserves the sight the mouth should be well cleansed with the same and the teeth rubbed with a dry coarse cloth after first scouring them with a sage leaf dipped in vinegar this will purify the breath and preserve the teeth from foulness and decay and last of all the head should be combed that the pores may be opened to expel such vapors as were not consumed by sleep  the next thing to be mentioned is the salubriety of the place we sleep in a high room dry sweet and wellaired free from smoke and remote from noise is the most wholesome neither should our chamber be hot for the spirits and natural heat of the body which is drawn inwardly by sleep as beforementioned will be counteracted by any extraordinary heat in the room but it should be moderately warm and free from damps either natural or artificial arising from new plaistered walls washing the floor or otherwise it may not be amiss here to mention the danger of sleeping in the open air or on the ground as many in the summer season do those whose stations in life oblige them to it as soldiers though for the present they escape the mischief are frequently afterward made sensible of the injury by aches stiffness or weakness of limbs and many other infirmities that proceed from it  our beds may be soft but should not sink in as that will suck from the body exhaust and impair our strength a mattrass upon a featherbed is both easy and wholesome as bedding receives the vapors and sweaty moisture of the body we should be careful that it is always clean sweet and wellaired for if it is not purified by air or fire it will contract an ill scent and become unwholesome if every one ought to be thus careful of the beds they constantly lie in themselves we may see how necessary it is that travelers should be cautious how and where they sleep no bedchamber should be washed in cold wet or foggy weather sweeping and brushing is sufficient to keep it decent and airing it in clear dry days by opening the windows will prevent its becoming offensive  as to the nature of our covering at night it should be according to the season of the year the head should be covered sufficiently to prevent its taking cold but not too warm lest it weaken it and hasten gray hairs for if the vapors issuing from the brain are impeded in their passage it will cause the hair to turn gray much sooner than it otherwise would  with respect to our manner of laying we may in a great measure consult our own ease the head should be higher than any other part of the body the bed from head to feet should be smooth and even without any fall below the pillow or hollow under the shoulders sleeping generally on the back is unwholesome as the humors of the head naturally fall by this means into the hinder part of the brain and may disorder it and the loins are thus more heated than they would otherwise be and of course the urinary passages more subject to obstructions persons afflicted with the stone should by no means sleep on their backs sleeping with the back upwards may be occasionally good for such persons as are troubled with wind and have a weak digestion the bowels being thus kept so much the warmer but to those who have weak eyes it is pernicious as a defluxion of humors may thus fall into them the most wholesome method of sleeping is on the side first on the left side especially to those who go to bed before they have digested their supper as the food will in this case better descend to the bottom of the stomach and then on the right that the motion of the heart may be freest from pressure but the principal thing to render sleep comfortable is as was hinted before to compose the mind if we lie down with roving troubled thoughts they will commonly calls us up before it is fit to rise and our sleep will not be piacid or refreshing when we lay by our clothes therefore let us not lay aside our business care and thoughts and let not a wandering fancy break our rest  it has been often doubted whether it be good to sleep with the mouth a little open some there are that altogether deny it but to sleep with the mouth open is certainly beneficial and that for these three reasons because the breath passes more freely and the fuliginous fumes are better sent forth than discussed hence it is that such as sleep with the mouth open have a sweet breath whereas those that sleep with it shut have generally an offensive breath and foul teeth the second is because some bad moisture may in sleep pass forth at the mouth which if shut would fall upon the lungs and be prejudicial the third reason is because owing to the descent of rheumes from the head the free passage of the breath through the nose may be impeded and snorings and offensive routings ensue that may disturb us of our rest and awaken us  but because the tongue palate and gums of such as sleep with their mouth open are commonly afterward very dry and covered with slimy matter though in fact those who sleep with their mouth shut are most subject to it all persons in the morning should wash their mouths and teeth well and gargle their throats and then every inconvenience is removed  the only thing further to be enquired into upon this subject is whether sweating at night be destructive to the constitution or not great sweats are undoubtedly weakening but light sweats are a great benefit for gross humors are thereby dissolved wind is discussed the blood is purified the spirits are refreshed the cramp palsy gout swelling of the joints and other parts achs numbness and heaviness of the limbs are prevented and consequently the whole body better preserved lively and in health but this caution must be observed and the body be not suddenly after it exposed to the cold air we will proceed now to  excretions or evacuations all that the stomach receives is not fit to be retained our food though studiously chosen and temperately used is not all converted into the substance of the body but some part of it is to be separated and sent forth the rest is to supply and nourish this regular course being continued the body thrives and is in good order but if that which should be evacuated be retained or that which ought to be retained be injuriosly passed off the regular economy is subverted and the constitution suffers and decays  the general excretions of the body are the stool or faeces and the urine and for ease and health they ought to be daily evacuated if our habit be naturally lax it is a happiness provided that laxity be not immoderate for such persons as are continually costive and have seldom the benefit of nature in the respect we are now talking of are liable to many disorders the faeces retained longer than they ought too often affect the head dim the sight occasion heaviness dullness and a degree of fever it is necessary therefore they should be daily evacuated if this cannot naturally be obtained the occasional taking of a little lenitive electuary will be very necessary  seminal evacuations ought also to be moderate the sperm is a substance full of spirit and if wilfully wasted will hurt the constitution more than the loss of forty times the quantity of blood immoderate venery is known to impair the strength hurt the sight consume the spirits and hasten old age and death  cibo vel potus repletis superflue evacuatis sive exercitatis coitus interdicitur tempus optimnm est mane and post dormias hyeme and vere frequentius permittitur aestate parcius juvenes sanguinei and pituitosi liberalius parcius melancholici parcissime biliosi senes emaciati although it has been an old saying as foolish as common qui medice vivit misere vivit he that lives by rule lives miserably yet experience teaches us the contrary and grounded upon pure reason and the contents of these pages that he who pays no regard to the injunctions of nature both shortens his life and destroys the comforts of it in short would you see without spectacles go without crutches or the help of a stick would you lie easy in your bed not telling the clock or wishing for day would you eat with an appetite and be yonng in strength when you are old in years in fact would you enjoy yourself and every thing about you and lengthen your life to the latest period exercise your reason and attend to the advice here given for qui medice vivit sine medicis diu vivet he that lives by rule and wholesome precepts is a physician to himself and needs not the help of others  whence it is that some who are very hungry and have good appetites eat little while others havlittle appetites each much this proceeds from the difference of stomachs a man with a small stomach that will hold but little will be satisfied with a small quantity of food whereas one with a large stomach though he seems not hungry yet when he comes to his meal will eat plentifully  a stomach naturally cold will crave more than it can digest on the contrary a hot stomach has but little appetite for heat destroys it hence it appears that a person with a large capacious stomach naturally cold will devour an immoderate quantity of food while one with a small stomach naturally hot will at his meals eat little or nothing  whence it is that the accustomed hour of eating being passed we often lose our appetite because the stomach being empty and hungry draws up from the intestines putrid vapors which destroy the appetite and as these vapors not only annoy the stomach but the head and spirits such as are desirous of health should at their usual hours of meals if they find a craving for food always indulge it by eating a little  cautions to be observed in the use of drinking the necessity and use of drink is to preserve natural moisture and to make good a mixture and distribution of meat that it may digest the better for these reasons it should be moderately taken at meals sundry little draughts are more wholesome than two or three large ones large draughts at meals makes the food fluctuate in the stomach this with its weakening and relaxing the coats of the stomach destroys digestion great draughts also lessen the natural heat of the stomach drives the food down too hastily and corrups the whole body with too great moisture and crudity  it will not be improper to mention here that such persons as accustom themselves to taking soup the first thing at a meal would do well to take it as hot as they can as the heat will be very comfortable to the stomach taken lukewarm it would soon prove nauseous though never so good the drinking cold beer after hot soup or broth is an absurd and hurtful custom for it counteracts the heat of the soup destroys the tone of the stomach and does mischief  drinking after meals unless we are dry is a pernicious custom especially if we drink during digestion is taking place as it destroys the natural heat that is working in the stomach but after the food is passed off from the stomach that is three or four hours after the meal a few glasses of wine to a person in years or of a cold constitution is beneficial as it will cleanse the stomach of the relics of the food and create a readier distribution of the nutritive part of it to the different parts of the body  the utility of taking physic in the spring the winter by its moisture naturally fills the body with crude and excrementitious humors and by its coldness thickens and stagnates the same and the approaching spring working on those humors rarifying and dissolving them they are apt to fluctuate and putrify in the body which unless by the force of nature or the assistance of medicine are often the cause of sickness  besides the uncertainty of the weather in spring its sudden alterations from hot to cold and from dry to moist will frequently produce feverish disorders according to the disposition of the matter congealed as it were in the body during the preceding winter hence it happens that people die more frequently in the spring than in any other season of the year  such persons therefore as are desirous to prevent these ill effects should take a dose or two of purging physic especially those who lead a sedentary life and the beginning of the spring is generally the best time for this salutary precaution  it is not necessary in general to take physic by way of prevention in the fall or autumn of the year  whether the losing of blood in the spring be necessary for the preservation of the health for such as are of a sanguine constitution phlethoric and full of blood it is benefical to prevent such dangers as a too great fullness of blood may occasion but it is far better to lessen their blood by a sparing and cooling diet than by opening a vein for blood being the very essence of our life diminishing its quantity frequently weakens the spirits and the constitution and hastens death  whether the occasional use of cordials be prejudicial to the constitution when used medicinally in case of necessity as when the stomach is weak or lapsed by cold a cordial may comfort and refresh it but the immoderate daily or unseasonable use of strong liquors must be pernicious although they may please the palate and sometimes not offend but warm and refresh the stomach yet in length of time from daily use and perhaps in an improper season they must destroy the temperature of the body burn up the blood and produce very dangerous symptoms  some observations upon drunkenness it is a maxim established upon good reason that every thing exceeding its just bounds is hurtful to nature the best of things are not excepted in this general rule even the necessary supports of life if not qualified and made wholesome by this corrective may prove the procurers of death  drink when carried to excess is no longer a refreshment to moisten or water the thirsty body nor a preservative but becomes an inundation to drown and suffocate the vital powers and is the cause of sickness it puts a man out of a state of health and disorders him so much that we may consider him as going to die  it has been said by some ancient physicians that to be drunk once a month is good physic and wholesome as by overcharging the stomach it provokes vomiting and so carries off what may be there lodged that would otherwise breed disease but this a poor plea for drunkenness that for the gaining one supposed benefit which might be obtained by other means we should run the risk of bringing on twenty disorders  drunkenness is certainly a disease for it has all the requisites to constitute a disease and is far distant from a state of health for if health be the free and regular discharge of the functions of the body and mind and sickness a weak and imperfect discharge of those functions then ebriety may properly be said to be a disease or sickness it having the symptoms of an acute disease for during the time of drunkenness and some time after few of the faculties perform their office righly  if we examine the intellectual faculties we shall find the reason gone the memory lost or bewildered and the will strangely perverted  if we look into the sensitive faculties they are also disordered their functions impeded or very defectively performed the eyes do not see well the ears hear well nor the palate relish etc the speech falters and is imperfect the stomach throws up its contents or nauseates the legs fail and the whole man is out of order  now according to these symptoms in other diseases we should judge the patient not likely to live or we should deem his recovery very difficult surely then drunkenness for the time it lasts must be a very great disease but because it does not in general prove mortal or continue long it is thought little or nothing of and is considered as a trival matter that will cure itself  but it may be asked why drunkenness is not usually mortal since the same symptoms in other diseases would be accounted so  to this we answer all the hopes we have that a drunken man should live is first because common experience shows that drunkenness is not mortal secondly from the nature of the cause strong drink which though it rage and strangely discompose the man for a time yet it lasts not long nor is it commonly mortal the inebriating spirits of the liquor flowing in so fast and joining with the natural spirits of the man occasions a tide so high as to overflow all the banks and bounds of order but these adventitious spirits are so amicable and friendly to our bodies in their own nature as not to be equally deadly injurious with that which is not so familiar besides their being so very volatile light and active nature much sooner recovers herself than if the morbific matter were more solid ponderous and fixed and further  those bad symptoms in other diseases are more to be feared because they depend perhaps upon malignant causes such as by time may be rooted in the constitution or from the defection of some principal part but the storm arising from drunkenness as it is suddenly raised so commonly it soon abates  but though drunkenness be not mortal nor the danger perhaps great for the present yet drunken bouts frequently repeated their relicts will accumulate weaken nature and lay the foundation of many chronic diseases nor can it be expected otherwise so that we may justly conclude from the manifest irregular actions which appear to us externally that the internal functions and their motions are strangely disordered for outward madness proceeds from inward impulses and disordered motions of the faculties which general disturbance must of course overturn the economy of nature and consequently ruin the whole system  the ill effects arising from intoxication are a changing of the natural tone of the stomach a destruction of its digestive powers and degeneration of the nutritive part of our food common experience tells us that after a drunken debauch the stomach loses its appetite and readiness of digestion and of course nausea belching and thirst ensue  great drinkers generally acquire an unwholesome corpulency of body or a lean confumptive constitution few of them escape so great a dependence is there upon the stomach that other parts cannot perform their duty if this leading principal part be perverted and debauched  now that different habits of body should arise from the same cause is owing to the different disposition of parts for in some persons although the stomach be vitiated yet the strength of the subsequent digestions is so great from the vigor of those parts destined to such offices that they act strenously though the matter on which they act be transmitted to them imperfect and degenerate and do therefore keep the body plump and full although the juices be foul and of a depraved nature  others on the contrary whose parts are not so strong lose the benefit of nutrition and fall away hence it is that by excessive drinking one man shall puff up fill and grow dropsical while another pines away and becomes consumptive  a third injury and a common one arising from intemperate drinking is a weakness of the nerves brought on by disorderly motions of the animal spirits thus we see the inconveniences and mischiefs attendant upon intemperance  drinking together is the pledge of friendship and to be made drunk is the characteristic of a generous and hearty entertainment for most commonly drinking concludes the feast when nature has been tempted with varieties and perhaps overcharged with them the next folly is to disturb and inebriate the spirits vitiate the fermentation and precipitate the food out of the stomach by a flood of liquor before digestion be finished that if you have escaped a surfeit by eating you shall not go away without a mischief by drinking thus your good dinner is spoiled and instead of being benefited by it you are injured and your friends civility becomes your destruction  but to the necessary uses of drink appointed by nature we have invented others and made it serve for pleasure for profit for wantonness and debauchery so that drink which should help to support nourish and maintain the strength and vigor of nature is made an unhappy instrument to abuse and injure the constitution  however as of drinking and drunkenness we have enumerated the evils let us not be so partial as to smother the benefits  drinking advances the revenue of excise and custom makes barley bear a good price and helps the farmer to pay his rent it keeps the physician and apothecary in employ and doubtless adds considerably to their business and is the support of many a publican but whether drinking ought to be promoted to forward these advantages with the destruction of health the shortening of life and the debauchery of the people we leave the reader to judge  observations on the smoking of tobacco tobacco is an herb of great antiquity and reputation among the indians of america it is also called nicotian but the name tobacco was given it by the spaniards from an island on which it plentifully grew and that of nicotian by the french from one nicot who first made them acquainted with it the indians call it petun or petum which is indeed the best general name to give it deriving it from the latin word peto it being far fetched and much sought after  it is an herb hot and dry in its nature and we believe of a destructive or venomous quality for being taken any way into the body it causes such a disturbance as to occasion violent vomiting and purging stupefying the senses and benumbing every part these effects do not proceed from the temperature of the herb but from the very essence of it common experience convinces us of its stupefying quality for smoking to such as are not used to it will bring on a drunenlike lightness of the head and if persisted in for any length of time will occasion a sleepiness of the whole system now as the benumbing effect of a plant generally arises from the coldness of its quality and as tobacco is of a hot nature it is evident that its sleepy quality is not owing to its temperature but its very substance however there is in the juice of this herb a cleansing and healing property and it is very effectual in the cure of any fresh wound or old sore  if it be objected by those who accustom themselves to smoke or chew tobacco that they find none of these injurious qualities i have mentioned let it be considered that it is owing to habit for by a constant use of it they in time render themselves insensible to its effects in the same manner as the turks do with respect to their chewing opium  the indians from whom we learned the manner of smoking accustomed themselves to use tobacco only when they were much fatigued with labor or exercise or when the wished to foretell things to come for the smokes lulling them to sleep and creating sundry dreams on their awaking they found themselves refreshed and from their wandering thoughts during their insensibility they fondly conceived they could prognosticate the event of any business they took in hand or any matter of importance they wished to know  their method of using it was this having dried the leaves they cast them on the coals and with a cane received the smoke of them by the mouth and nostrills till they fell into a drunken trance or sleep in which they continued three or four hours according to the quantity of smoke they had taken in after which they found themselves lightened and refreshed and were able to return to their labor or exercise as before  but we smoke tobacco for no such purpose where one person takes a pipe medicinally a hundred do it for pleasure to pass away the time and as this is done indiscriminately at all times and by all ages and constitutions very often to the injury of health a few observations upon this subject can be no less profitable than pleasing  notwithanding there is something injurious in the nature of tobacco and it leaves a disagreeable smell and savor behind it yet it is beneficial to such persons as are of a cold moist constitution and troubled with rheums especially in cold damp weather and when used moderately for it will expel wind dissolve and dissipate cold humors raise the spirits ease pains in the teeth swellings of the gums and aches of the joints and if the smoke be swallowed it will speedily cure a surfeit by causing a sudden evacuation both upwards and downwards but to such as are not of a cold and moist constitution nor affected with rheums though it be only taken in at the mouth and immediately ejected it is unwholesome as its heat will greatly affect the brain and disturb the animal spirits as to swallowing the smoke unless medicinally or by way of physic it is absolutely pernicious both to the stomach and the lungs for it disturbs digestion and tends to dry up the soft and spungy substance of the lungs if any one therefore has habituated himself to this idle practice let him instantly leave it off for though he may find no great inconveniences arising from it while he is young and strong yet he may be assured when it is too late to repair the injury he will discover that it has ruined his constitution  there are two or three cautions to be observed by those who accustom themselves to smoking which shall conclude the whole one is that in drawing the smoke they take care that they suck it not suddenly into their throat or windpipe as in such case it will much offend and disturb both the lungs and the mouh of the stomach another caution is in returning the smoke from the mouth to take care it does not outwardly affect the eyes for it will do them a great deal of injury a third caution not to go abroad into the air for half an hour after they quit their pipe especially if the season be cold or damp for the tobacco will open the pores of the head and the sudden access of the cold air may do a great deal of mischief hence we may see how idle and foolish such persons act who walk or travel with a pipe in their mouths in the last place such as are of a dry lean constitution should shun the use of tobacco totally for its drying nature must be destructive to such habits  finis this day is published by j bell in the strand price  s  d with a
