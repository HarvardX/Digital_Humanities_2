friendship and study of the higher poets  an essay on epic poetry epistle i perish that critic pride which often has hurled its empty thunders over the epic world which eager to extend its mimic reign would bind free fancy in a servile chain with papal rage the eye of genius blind and bar the gates of glory on the mind such dark decrees have lettered bigots penned ver   see note i  yet seized that honored name the poets friend but learning from her page their laws will blot scorned be their arrogance their name forgot the indignant bard abhorring base control seeks the just critic of congenial soul say mason judge and master of the lyre harmonious chief of britains living choir say will thou listen to his weaker strains who pants to range round fancys rich domains to vindicate her empire and disown proud system seated on her injured throne come while thy muse contented with applause gives to her graceful song a little pause enjoying triumphs past at leisure laid in thy sweet gardens variegated shade or fondly hanging on some favorite oak that harp whose notes the fate of mona spoke strung by the sacred druids social band and wisely trusted to thy kindred hand come for thy liberal and ingenuous heart can aid a brother in this magic art let us and freedom be our guide explore the highest province of poetic lore free the young bard from that oppressive awe which feels opinions rule as reasons law and from his spirit bid vain fears depart of weakened nature and exhausted art phantoms that literary spleen conceives dullness adopts and indolence believes while with adventurous step we wind along the expansive regions of heroic song from different sources let our search explain why few the chieftains of this wide domain happily inspiriting poetic youth our verse may prove this animating truth that poesys sublime neglected field may still new laurels to ambition yield her epic trumpet in a modern hand still make the spirit glow the heart expand be such our doctrine our enlivening aim the muses honor and our countrys fame thou first and fairest of the social arts sovereign of liberal souls and feeling hearts if in devotion to thy heavenly charms i clasped thy altar with my infant arms for thee neglected the wide field of wealth the toils of interest and the sports of health  enchanting poesy that zeal repay with powers to sing thy universal sway to trace thy progress from thy distant birth heavens pure descendant dear delight of earth charm of all regions to no age confined the prime ennobler of the aspiring mind nor will thy dignity sweet power disdain what fiction utters in her idle strain thy sportive friend who mocking solemn truth tells her fond tales of thy untutored youth as wronged latona so her tale begins to delphos traveled with her youthful twins the envenomed python with terrific sway crossed the fair goddess in her destined way the heavenly parent in the wild alarm her little dian in her anxious arm high on a stone which she in terror trod cried to her filial guard the archer god bidding with force that spoke the mothers heart her young apollo launch his ready dart in measured sounds her rapid mandate flowed the first foundation of the future ode thus at their banquets fabling greeks rehearse ver    see note ii  the fancied origin of sacred verse and though cold reason may with scorn assail or turn contemptuous from their simple tale yet poesy thy sister art may stoop from this weak sketch to paint the impassioned group though taste refined to modern verse deny the hacknied pageants of the pagan sky their sinking radiance still the canvass warms painting still glories in their graceful forms nor can thou envy if the world agree to grant thy sister claims denied to thee for thee the happier art the elderborn superior rights and dearer charms adorn confined she catches with observance keen her single moment of the changeful scene but thou endud with energy sublime unquestioned arbiter of space and time can join the distant the unknown create and while existence yields thee all her state on the astonished mind profusely pour myriads of forms that fancy must adore yet of thy boundless power the dearest part is firm possession of the feeling heart no progeny of chance by labor taught no slowformd creature of scholastic thought the child of passion thou thy lyre she strung to her parental notes she tuned thy tongue gave thee her boldest swell her softest tone and made the compass of her voice thy own to admiration source of joy refined chaste lovely mover of the simple mind to her though skeptics in their pride declaim with many an insult on her injured name to her sweet poesy we owe thy birth thou first encomiast of the fruitful earth by her inspired the earliest mortal found the eardelighting charm of measured sound he hailed the maker of a world so fair and the first accent of his song was prayer o most attractive of those airy powers who most illuminate mans checkered hours is there an art in all the group divine whose dawn of being must not yield to thine religions self whose provident control takes from fierce man his anarchy of soul she over thy youth with fond affection hung and borrowed music from thy infant tongue law sterner law whose potent voice impressed severest terror on the human breast with thy fresh flowers her aweful figure crowned and spoke her mandate in thy softer sound even cold philosophy whom later days saw thy mean rival envious of thy praise who closed against thee her ungrateful arms and urged her plato to defame thy charms she from thy childhood gained no fruitless aid from thee she learnt her talent to persuade gay nature viewed thee with a smiling glance the graces round thee framed the frolic dance and well might festive joy thy favor court thy song turned strife to peace and toil to sport exhausted vigor at thy voice revived and mirth from thee her dearest charm derived triumphant love in thy alliance blessed enlarged his empire over the gentle breast his torch assumed new luster from thy breath and his clear flame defied the clouds of death but of the splendid train who felt thy sway or drew existence from thy vital ray glory with fondest zeal proclaimed thy might and hailed thee victor of oblivious night her martial trumpet to thy hand she gave at once to quicken and reward the brave it sounds  his blood the kindling hero pays a cheap and ready price for thy eternal praise though selfish fear the immortal strain deride and mock the warriors wish as frantic pride ye gallant hapless dead of distant time whose fame has perished unembalmd in rhyme as through the desert air your ashes fly in fancys ear the nameless atoms cry to us unhappy cruel fates refuse the wellearnd record of the applauding muse blessed are those chiefs who blazoned on her roll still waken virtue in each kindred soul their bright existence still on earth prolong and shine for ever in the deathless song yet often oblivion in a treacherous shade has sunk the tuneful rites to valor paid her palsied lips refusing to rehearse the sacred old traditionary verse as well the curious eye with keen desire might hope to catch that spark of vital fire which first through chaos shot a sudden light and quickened nature in its transient flight as the fond ear to catch the fleeting note which on the ravished air was heard to float when first the muse her epic strain began and every listening chief grew more than man but as the ruler of the newborn day from chaos rose in glorys rich array so from deep shades impenetrably strong that shroud the darkened world of ancient song bright homer bursts magnificently clear the solar lord of that poetic sphere before whose blaze in wide luxuriance spread each grecian star hides his diminished head whose beams departed yet enchant the sight in latiums softer chaste reflected light say ye whose curious philosophic eye searches the depth where natures secrets lie ye who can tell how her capricious fit directs the flow and ebb of human wit and why obedient to her quick command springtides of genius now enrich her favorite land now sink by her to different climes assigned and only leave some worthless weeds behind say why in greece unrivaled and alone the sovereign poet graced his epic throne why did the realm that echoed his renown produce no kindred heir to claim his crown if as the liberal mind delights to think fancys rich flowers their vital essence drink from libertys pure streams that largely roll their quickening virtue through the poets soul why in the period when this friend of earth made greece the model of heroic worth and saw her votaries act beneath her sway scenes more sublime than fiction can display why did the epic muses silent lyre ver  0  see note iii  shrink from those feats that summoned all her fire or if as courtly theorists maintain the muses revel in a monarchs reign why when young ammons soul athirst for fame called every art to celebrated his name when ready painting at his sovereign nod with aweful thunder armed this mimic god why did coy poesy though fondly wooed refuse that dearer smile for which he sued and see him shed in martial honors bloom the tear of envy on achilles tomb in vain would reason those nice questions solve which the fine play of mental powers involve in bards of ancient time with genius fraught what mind can trace how thought engendered thought how little hints awaked the large design and subtle fancy spun her variegated line yet sober critics of no vulgar note but such as learnings sons are proud to quote the progress of homeric verse explain as if their souls had lodged in homers brain laughs not the spirit of poetic frame however slightly warmed by fancys flame when grave bossu by systems studied laws ver     see note iv  the grecian bards ideal picture draws and wisely tells us that his song arose as the good parsons quiet sermon grows who while his easy thoughts no pressure find from hosts of images that crowd the mind first calmly settles on some moral text then creeps  from one division  to the next nor if poetic minds more slowly drudge through the cold comments of this gallic judge will their indignant spirit less deride that subtle pedants more presumptive pride whose bloated page with arrogance replete imputes to virgil his own dark conceit ver     see note v  and from the tortured poet dares to draw that latent sense which horace never saw which if on solid proof more strongly built must brand the injured bard with impious guilt while such dictators their vain efforts waste in the dark visions of distempered taste let us that pleasing happier light pursue which beams benignant from the milder few who justly conscious of the doubts that start in all nice questions on each finer art with modest doubt assign each likely cause but dare to dictate no decisive laws it is said by one who with this candid claim ver     see note vi  has gained no fading wreath of critic fame who fondly listening to her various rhyme has marked the muses step through many a clime that where the settled rules of writing spread where learnings code of critic law is read though other treasures deck the enlightened shore the germs of fancy ripen there no more are critics then that bold imperious tribe the guards of genius who his path prescribe are they like visirs in an eastern court who sap the very power they should support whose specious wiles the royal mind unnerve and sink the monarch they pretend to serve no of their value higher far i deem and prize their useful toil with fond esteem when lowths firm spirit leads him to explore the hallowed confines of hebraic lore when his free pages luminous and bold the glorious end of poesy unfold assert her powers her dignity defend and speak her as she is fair freedoms friend when thus he shines his mitred peers above i view his warmth with reverential love proud if my verse may catch reflected light from the rich splendour of a mind so bright blessed be the names to no vain system tied who render learnings blaze an useful guide a friendly beacon raised on high to teach the wandering bark to shun the shallow beach but o ye noble and aspiring few whose ardent souls poetic fame pursue ye on whom smiling heaven perfections source seems to bestow unlimitable force the inborn vigor of your souls defend nor lean too fondly on the firmest friend genius may sink on criticisms breast by weak dependence on her truth oppressed sleep on her lap and stretch his lifeless length shorn by her soothing hand of all his strength thou will not mason thou whose generous heart must feel that freedom is the soul of art thou will not hold me arrogant or vain if i advise the young poetic train to deem infallible no critics word not even the dictates of thy attic hurd no not the stagyrites unquestioned page the sire of critics sanctified by age the noblest minds with solid reason blessed who feel that faculty above the rest who argue on those arts they never try exalt that reason they so often apply till in its pride with tyrannous control it crush the kindred talents of the soul and hence in every art will systems rise which fancy must survey with angry eyes and at the lightning of her scornful smile in frequent ruin sinks the labored pile how often my romney have i known thy vein swell with indignant heat and generous pain to hear in terms both arrogant and tame some reasoning pedant on thy art declaim its laws and limits when his sovereign taste with firm precision has minutely traced and in the close of a decisive speech pronounced some point beyond the pencils reach how has thy genius by one rapid stroke refuted all the sapient things he spoke thy canvass placing in the clearest light his own impossible before his sight o might the bard who loves thy mental fire who to thy fame attund his early lyre learn from thy genius when dull fops decide so to refute their systematic pride let him at least succeeding poets warn to view the pedants lore with doubt or scorn and even to question with a spirit free established critics of the first degree among the names that judgment loves to praise the pride of ancient or of modern days what laws of poesy can learning show above the critic song of sage despreaux his fancy elegant his judgment nice his method easy and his style concise the bard of reason with her vigor fraught her purest doctrine he divinely taught nor taught in vain his precept clear and chaste reformed the errors of corrupted taste and french imagination who was bit by that tarantula distorted wit ceasing her antic gambols to rehearse blessed the pure magic of his healing verse with his loud fame applauding europe rung and his just praise a rival poet sung yet had this friend of versedevoted youth this tuneful teacher of poetic truth had he but chanced his doctrine to diffuse ere milton commund with his facred muse and could that english selfdependant soul born with such energy as mocks control could his high spirit with submissive awe have stooped to listen to a gallic law his hallowed subject by that law forbid ver     see note vii  might still have laid in silent darkness hid and this bright sun not rising in our sphere homer had wanted still his true compeer from hence let genius to himself be just hence learn ye bards a liberal distrust whenever it is said by systems haughty son that what he cannot do can never be done it is fancys right the exalted throne to press whose height proud system can but blindly guess springs whose existence she denies unlock and call rich torrents from the flinty rock let the true poet who would build a name in noble rivalship of ancient fame when he would plan to triumph over time the splendid fabric of his lofty rhyme let him the pride of constantine assume the imperial founder of the second rome who scorned all limits to his work assigned ver     see note viii  save by the inspiring god who ruled his mind or like the fabled jupiter ut perhibent spatium quum discere vellet naturae regni nescius ipse sui armigeros utrimque duos aequalibus alis misit ab eois occiduisque plagis parnassus geminos fertur junxisse volatus contulit alternas pythius axis aves claudian jove to ascertain the doubtful confines of his wide domain two eagles let him send of equal wing whose different flight may form a perfect ring and at the point where sense and fancy meet there safely bold and though sublime discreet his fames foundation let him firmly lay nor dread the danger of disputed sway yet if the bard to glory must aspire by free exertion of unborrowd fire nor like the classic bigot vainly deem no modern muse can challenge just esteem unless her robe in every fold be pressed to fall precisely like the grecian vest if the blind notion he must boldly shun that beautys countless forms are only one and not when fancy from her magic hoard would blindly bring him treasures unexplord snap her light wand and force her hand to bear the heavier compass and the formal square let him no less their dangerous pride decline who singly criticize their own design in that nice toil what various perils lurk not pride alone may mar the needful work but foes more common to the feeling nerve where taste and genius dwell with coy reserve the sickly doubt with modest weakness fraught the languid tedium of oerlabourd thought the pain to feel the growing work behind the finished model in the forming mind these foes that often the poets bosom pierce these that condemned to fire virgilian verse prove that the bard a bold yet trembling elf should find a critic firmer than himself but what fine spirit will assume the judge patient through all this irksome toil to drudge it is here o friendship here thy glories shine the hard the important task is only thine for thou alone can all the powers unite that justly make it thy peculiar right thine the fixed eye which at no foible winks thine the warm zeal which utters all it thinks in those sweet tones that hasty spleen disarm that give to painful truth a winning charm and the quick hand of listening genius teach to grasp that excellence he burns to reach thou sweet subduer of all mental strife thou source of vigor thou support of life nor art nor science could delight or live without that energy thy counsels give genius himself must fink in dumb despair unblest uncherishd by thy cheering care nor let the bard elate with youthful fire when fancy to his hand presents the lyre when her strong plumes his soaring spirit lift when friendship heavens more high and holy gift with zeal angelic prompts his daring flight and round him darts her doubtdispelling light let him not then by vanity betrayed look with unjust contempt on learnings aid but as the adventurous seaman to attain that bright renown which great discoverers gain consults the conduct of each gallant name who sailed before him in that chase of fame reviews with frequent glance their useful chart marks all their aims and fathoms all their art so let the poet trace their happy course so bravely emulate their mental force whose daring souls from many a different clime have nobly ventured on the sea of rhyme led by no fear his swelling sail to slack let him with eager eyes pursue the track not like a pirate with insidious views to plunder every vessel he pursues but with just hope to find yet farther shores and pass each rival he almost adores end of the first epistle epistle the second argument of the second epistle character of ancient poets  homer  apollonius rhodius  virgil  lucan  an essay on epic poetry epistle ii hail mighty father of the epic line thou vast prolific intellectual mine whence veins of ancient and of modern gold the wealth of each poetic world have rolled great bard of greece whose everduring verse all ages venerate all tongues rehearse could blind idolatry be justly paid to aught of mental power by man displayed to thee thou sire of soulexalting song that boundless worship might to thee belong for as thy jove on his olympian throne in his unrivaled sway exults alone commanding nature by his aweful nod in high seclusion from each humbler god so shines thy genius through the cloud of years exalted far above thy pagan peers by the rich splendour of creative fire and the deep thunder of thy martial lyre the conscious world confesses thy control and hails thee sovereign of the kindling soul yet could thy mortal shape revisit earth how would it move great bard thy scornful mirth to hear vain pedants to thy verse assign scholastic thoughts that never could be thine to hear the quaint conceits of modern pride blaspheme thy fancy and thy taste deride when thus in vanitys capricious fit we see thy fame traduced by gallic wit ver    see note i  we see a dwarf who dares his foot to rest on a recumbent giants ample chest and lifting his pert form to public sight boasts like a child his own superior height but neither envious wits malignant craft though armed with ridicules envenomed shaft nor fickle fashions more tyrannic sway whose varying voice the sons of earth obey can shake the solid base of thy renown or blast the verdure of thy laurel crown though time who from his manycolourd wings scatters ten thousand shades over human things has wrought unnumberd changes since thy birth and given new features to the face of earth though all thy gods who shook the starry pole unquestioned rulers of the pagan soul are fallen with their fanes in ruin hurled their worship vanished from the enlightened world still its immortal force thy song retains still rules obedient man and fires his glowing veins for natures self that great and constant power one and the same through every changing hour gave thee each secret of her reign to pierce and stamped her signet on thy sacred verse that aweful signet whose imperial sway no age disputes no regions disobey for at its sight the subject passions start and open all the passes of the heart twas nature taught thy genius to display that host of characters who grace thy lay so richly varied and so vast the store her plastic hand can hardly model more twas nature noblest of poetic guides gave thee thy flowing verse whose copious tides gushing luxuriant from high fancys source by no vain art diverted in their course with splendid ease with simple grandeur roll spread their free wealth and fertilize the soul there are whom blind and erring zeal betrays to wound thy genius with illjudging praise who rashly deem thee of all arts the sire who draw dull smoke from thy resplendent fire pretend thy fancied miracles to pierce and form quaint riddles of thy clearest verse blind to those brighter charms and purer worth which make thy lays the lasting joy of earth for why has every age with fond acclaim swelled the loud note of thy increasing fame not that cold study may from thee deduce vain codes of mystic lore and laws abstruse but that thy song presents like solar light a world in action to the enraptured sight that with a force beyond the enervate rules of tame philosophys pedantic schools thy living images instruct mankind mould the just heart and fire the heroic mind even socrates himself that purest sage ver    see note ii  imbibed his wisdom from thy moral page and happily greece the wonder of the earth for feats of martial fire and civic worth that glorious land of noblest minds the nurse owes her unrivaled race to thy inspiring verse for o what greek who in his youthful vein had felt thy soulinvigorating strain who that had caught amid the festive throng the public lesson of thy patriot song could ever cease to feel his bosom swell with zeal to dare and passion to excel in thee thy grateful country justly praised the noblest teacher of the tribes she raised thy voice which doubly gave her fame to last formed future heroes while it sung the past what deep regret thy fond admirers feel that mythologic clouds thy life conceal that like a distant god you are darkly shown felt in thy works but in thyself unknown perchance the shades that hide thy mortal days from keen affections disappointed gaze and that idolatry so fondly proud with which thy country to thy genius bowed might form the cause why kindling with thy fire no grecian rival struck thy epic lyre perchance not seeing how thy steps were trained how they the summit of parnassus gained on thy oppressive glorys flaming pride young emulation gazed and gazing died the muses of the attic stage impart to many a votary their kindred art and she who bids the theban eagle bear her lyric thunder through the stormy air how high soever she leads his daring flight ver     see note iii  guides his bold rivals to an equal height of all the grecian bards in glorys race it is thine alone by thy unequalled pace to reach the goal with loud applause and hear no step approaching thine no rival near yet may not judgment with severe disdain slight the young rhodians variegated strain ver     see note iv  though with less force he strike an humbler shell beneath his hand the notes of passion swell his tender genius with alluring art displays the tumult of the virgins heart when love like quivering rays that never rest darts through each vein and vibrates in her breast though nature feel his verse though she declare medeas magic is still potent there yet fancy sees the slighted poet rove in pensive anger through the elysian grove from critic shades whose supercilious pride his song neglected or his powers decried he turns indignant  unopprest by fears behold he seeks the sentence of his peers see their just band his honest claim allow see pleasure lighten on his laurelld brow he soars the critics cold contempt above for virgil greets him with fraternal love hail thou rich column on whose highwrought frame the roman muse supports her epic fame hail great magician whose illusive charms gave pleasing luster to a tyrants arms to joves pure scepter turned his iron rod and made the homicide a guardian god hail wondrous bard to glorys temple led through paths that genius rarely deigns to tread for imitation she whose siren song betrays the skilful and unnerves the strong preserving thee on her perfidious shore where many a poet had been wrecked before led thee to heights that charm the astonished eye and with inventions heaven in splendour vie as rome herself by long unwearied toil gleaned the fair produce of each foreign soil from all her wide dominions various parts borrowed their laws their usages their arts imported knowledge from each adverse zone and made the wisdom of the world her own thy patient spirit thus from every bard whose mental riches won thy just regard drew various treasure which thy skill refined and in the fabric of thy verse combined it was thy glory as thy fond desire to echo the sweet notes of homers lyre but with an art thy hand alone can reach an art that has endeared the strain of each so the young nymph whose tender arms embrace an elder sister of enchanting grace though formed herself with every power to please by genuine character and native ease yet fondly copies from her favorite fair her mien her motion her attractive air her robes nice shape her ribands pleasing hue and every ornament that strikes the view but she displays by imitative art so quick a spirit and so soft a heart the graceful mimic while our eyes adore we think the model cannot charm us more though seen together each more lovely shows and by comparison their beauty grows some critics to decide which bard prevails weigh them like jove but not in golden scales in their false balance the wronged greek they raise virgil sinks loaded with their heavy praise ver   0 see note v  ingenuous bard whose mental rays divine shaded by modest doubts more sweetly shine thou whose last breath unconscious of the wrong doomed to destruction thy sublimest song how dull their incense in thy sight must burn how must thy spirit with abhorrence turn from their disgusting rites who at thy shrine blaspheme thy masters name to honor thine more equal tribute in their simpler flowers the poets offer to your separate powers for all poetic eyes delight to view your different forms and with devotion due in each the radiant delphic god they own by beauteous majesty distinctly shown but they behold the lofty homer stand the bright colossus of the rhodian land beneath whose feet the waves submissive roll whose towering head appears to prop the pole stupendous image grand in every part and seeming far above the reach of mortal art in thee thou lovely mantuan bard appear the softer features of the belvidere that finished grace which fascinates all eyes yet from the copying hand elusive flies charms so complete by such pure spirit warmed they make less perfect beauty seem deformed o had thy muse whose decorating skill could spread rich foliage over the leafless hill had she who knew with nicest hand to frame the sweet unperishable wreaths of fame had she exalted by a happier fate virtues free herald and no slave of state decked worthier shrines with her unfading flower and given to freedom what she gave to power then with more keen delight and warmer praise the world had listened to thy bolder lays perchance had owed to thee a mighty debt verse where perfection her bright seal had set where art could nothing blame and nature naught regret of coarser form with less pathetic charms hating with stoic pride a tyrants arms in the keen fervor of that florid time when youthful fancy pours her hasty rhyme when all the minds luxuriant shoots appear untrimmd by art by interest or fear see daring lucan for that wreath contend which freedom twines for her poetic friend it is thine thou bold but injured bard it is thine though critic spleen insult thy rougher line though wronged thy genius and thy name misplaced by vain distinctions of fastidious taste indignant freedom with just anger fired shall guard the poet whom herself inspired what though thy early uncorrected page betrays some marks of a degenerate age though many a tumid point thy verse contains like warts projecting from herculean veins though like thy cato thy stern muse appear her manners rigid and her frown austere like him still breathing freedoms genuine flame justice her idol public good her aim well she supplies her want of softer art by all the sterling treasures of the heart by energy from independance caught and the free vigor of unborrowd thought thou bard most injured by malicious fate could not thy blood appease a tyrants hate must he still galled by thy poetic claim with falsehood persecute thy moral fame shall historys pen to aid his vengeance won ver   0 see note vi  brand thee brave spirit as an impious son who meanly feared to yield his vital flood and sought his safety by a parents blood base calumny at which belief must halt and blind credulity herself revolt could that firm youth become so vile a slave whose voice new energy to virtue gave whose stoic soul all abject thoughts abhorred and owned no sordid passion as its lord who in the trying hour of mortal pain while life was ebbing from his open vein alike unconscious of remorse and fear his heart unshaken and his senses clear smiled on his doom and like the fabled bird whose music on meanders bank was heard formed into tuneful notes his parting breath and sung the approaches of undreaded death rise thou wronged bard above detractions reach whose arts in vain thy various worth impeach enjoy that fame thy spirit knew to prize and viewed so fondly with prophetic eyes though the nice critics of fastidious france survey thy song with many a scornful glance and as a goth the kinder judge accuse who with their great corneille commends thy muse let britain eager as the lesbian state to shield thy pompey from the wrongs of fate to thee with pride a fond attachment show thou bard of freedom though the worlds thy foe as keenly sensible of beautys sway let our just isle such generous honor pay to the fair partner of thy hapless life as lesbos paid to pompeys lovely wife ver     see note vii  ye feeling painters who with genius warm delineate virtue in her softest form let argentaria on your canvass shine ver     see note viii  a graceful mourner at her poets shrine for nobly fearless of the tyrants hate she mourns her murdered bard in solemn state with pious care she decks his splendid tomb where the dark cypress sheds its soothing gloom there frequent takes her solitary stand his dear pharsalia in her faithful hand that hand whose toil the muses still rehearse which fondly copied his unfinished verse see as she bends before his recent urn see tender grief to adoration turn o lovely mourner could my song bestow unfading glory on thy generous woe age after age thy virtue should record and thou should live immortal

poetry epistle iii blessed be the hand that with a generous care to the bright crown which learning loves to wear restores the gem whose luster faint and pale died in the fold of dark oblivions veil such praise o mason to the bard is due in whose fraternal guard thy genius grew over whose untimely grave thy lyre has paid its just devotion to a brothers shade and thus hereafter shall the british muse in memorys fane the fairest tablet choose to bid her sons your blended names admire the pride of friendships as of fancys choir thy modest gray solicitous to pierce the dark and distant source of modern verse by strings untried first taught his english lyre to reach the gothic harps terrific fire the norths wild specter own his potent hand and hells nine portals at his voice expand with new existence by his verse endued see gothic fable wakes her shadowy brood which in the runic rhymes of many a scald with pleasing dread our northern sires appalled ye brave progenitors ye vigorous source of modern freedom and of europes force while your rude minds athirst for martial strife mocked all the meaner arts of polished life the muse still led you by her magic clue and from your savage strength new vigor drew in wars dire field your dauntless bards appeared aloft their animating harps they reared poured through the charging host their potent strain and swelled the fiery flood in valors vein souls thus inspired in every scene elate defied the utmost rage of adverse fate in torturing death the royal captive sang and smiles of triumph hid his mortal pang ver    see note i  thus to brave odins songs our northern sire rude early framer of the modern lyre fierce freedom gave an energy sublime parent and guardian of the gothic rhyme while nurtured in the norths protecting arms the modern muse displayed her infant charms like joves undaunted child her spirit glowed and force herculean in her cradle showed her native scene in roughness she surpast her breath tempestuous as the northern blast but when to softer climes the vagrant flew and baskd beneath a sky of azure hue when for her throne the flowery south she chose and formed her crown of the provencal rose warmed by a brighter suns relaxing beams she tuned her altered voice to tender themes here her gay form a gaudier dress assumes and shines in chivalrys imperial plumes her votaries wear proud honors mystic glove and every lyre resounds romantic love save when to burst oppressions mental chain keen satire mingles with this gallant train strikes priestly pride with wits vindictive flash and galls the ghostly tyrant with her lash ver  0 see note ii  afraid of poesys expansive flood these early bards along the shallows scud in some light skiff for on the depths untried no fulltrimmd vessel floats in epic pride as infants eager for regard abound in sportive efforts of uncertain sound before their little artless lips can reach the harder elements of perfect speech so the young language of each modern clime rose by prelusive lays to lofty rhyme through many an age while in the convent bred over the chilled mind scholastic darkness spread those keener spirits who from nature caught the warmth that kindles to poetic thought betrayed ambition by thy blind desire struck with illfated zeal the latian lyre ver    see note iii  though discords hand the jarring strings had crossed and all the sweetness of their tone was lost at length fair italy luxuriant land where arts rich flowers in earliest bloom expand thy daring dante his wild vision sung ver    see note iv  and raised to epic pomp his native tongue down arnos stream his newformd music floats the proud vale echoing with his tuscan notes see the bold bard now sink and now ascend wherever thought can pierce or life extend in his wide circuit from hells drear abyss through purifying scenes to realms of perfect bliss he seems begirt with all that airy throng who brighten or debase the poets song sublimest fancy now directs his march to opening worlds through that infernal arch over whose rough summit aweful words are read that freeze each entering soul with hopeless dread now at her bidding his strong numbers flow and rend the heart at ugolinos woe while natures glorygiving tear bedews a tale unrivaled by the grecian muse now to those notes that milder grief inspire pathetic tenderness attunes his lyre which soft as murmurs of the plaintive dove tells the sad issue of illicit love but all the worse conpanions of his way soon into different sounds his ductile voice betray satiric fury now appears his guide through thorny paths of enmity and pride now quaint conceit his wandering steps misleads through all the hideous forms that folly breeds now priestly dullness the lost bard enshrouds in cold confusion and scholastic clouds unequal spirit in thy various strain with all their influence light and darkness reign in thy strange verse and wayward theme alike new forms of beauty and disorder strike extremes of harmony and discord dwell the seraphs music and the demons yell the patient reader to thy merit just with transport glows and shudders with disgust thy failings sprung from thy disastrous time thy stronger beauties from a soul sublime whose vigor burst like the volcanos flame from central darkness to the sphere of fame of gentler mind and with a heart to feel the fondest warmth of emulative zeal thy festive scholar who adored thy lays and graced thy genius with no scanty praise the gay boccacio tempts the italian muse ver     see note v  more varied notes and different themes to choose themes which her voice had dared not yet to found valors heroic feats by beauty crowned sweet was the glowing song but strange to tell on his bold lyre oblivions shadows fell his richer tales

greece turns pale and trembles at his fame which shades the luster of her homers name hence sacred virgil from thy soul adore above the rest and to thy utmost power pursue the glorious paths he struck before pitts translation  a critic who lately rose to great eminence in our own country has endeavored by a more singular method to damp the ardour of inventive genius and to annihilate the hopes of all who would aspire to the praise of originality in this higher species of poetical composition he has attempted to establish a triumvirate in the epic world with a perpetuity of dominion every reader who is conversant with modern criticism will perceive that i allude to the following passage in the famous dissertation on the sixth book of virgil  just as virgil rivalled homer so milton emulated both of them he found homer possessed of the province of morality virgil of politics and nothing left for him but that of religion this he seized as aspiring to share with them in the government of the poetic world and by means of the superior dignity of his subject has gotten to the head of that triumvirate which took so many ages in forming these are the three species of the epic poem for its largest sphere is human action which can be considered but in a moral political or religious view and these the three makers for each of their poems was struck out at a heat and came to perfection from its first essay here then the grand scene was closed and all farther improvements of the epic at an end  i apprehend that few critical remarks contain more absurdity to use the favorite expression of the author i have quoted than the preceding lines surely milton is himself a proof that human action is not the largest sphere of the epic poem and as to virgil his most passionate admirers must allow that in subject and design he is much less of an original than camoens or lucan but such a critical statute of limitation if i may call it so is not less pernicious than absurd to disfigure the sphere of imagination with these capricious and arbitrary zones is an injury to science such criticism instead of giving spirit and energy to the laudable ambition of a youthful poet can only lead him to start like macbeth at unreal mockery and to exclaim when he is invited by genius to the banquet the tables full  note ii verse    thus at their banquets fabling greeks rehearse the fancied origin of sacred verse for this fable such as it is i am indebted to a passage in athenaeus which the curious reader may find in the close of that fanciful and entertaining compiler page  0  of casaubons edition  note iii verse  0  why did the epic muses silent lyre shrink from those feats that summoned all her fire i have ventured to suppose that greece produced no worthy successor of homer and that her exploits against the persians were not celebrated by any poet in a manner suitable to so sublime a subject  yet an author named chaerilus is said to have recorded those triumphs of his country in verse and to have pleased the athenians so highly as to obtain from them a public and pecuniary reward he is supposed to have been a cotemporary of the historian herodotus but from the general silence of the more early greek writers concerning the merit of this poet we may i think very fairly conjecture that his compositions were not many degrees superior to those of his unfortunate namesake who frequented the court of alexander the great and is said to have sung the exploits of his sovereign on the curious conditions of receiving a piece of gold for every good verse and a box on the ear for every bad one the old scholiast on horace who has preserved this idle story concludes it by saying that the miserable bard was beat to death in consequence of his contract some eminent modern critics have indeed attempted to vindicate the reputation of the more early chaerilus who is supposed to be confounded both by horace himself and afterward by scaliger with the chaerilus rewarded by alexander vossius de historicis graecis  in particular appears a warm advocate in his behalf and appeals to various fragments of the ancient bard preserved by aristotle strabo and others and to the testimony of plutarch in his favor but on consulting the fragments he has referred to they rather fortify than remove my conjecture the scrap preserved by aristotle in his rhetoric is only half a verse and quoted without any commendation of its author the two citations in strabo amount to little more the curious reader may also find in athenaeus an epitaph on sardanapalus attributed to this poet who is mentioned by the same author as peculiarly addicted to the grosser excesses of the table  let us now return to that chaerilus whom horace has damned to everlasting fame the judicious and elegant roman satirist seems remarkably unjust in paying a compliment to the poetical judgment of his patron augustus at the expense of the macedonian hero alexander appears to have possessed much more poetical spirit and a higher relish for poetry than the coldblooded octavius it is peculiarly unfair to urge his liberality to a poor poet as a proof that he wanted critical discernment when he had himself so thoroughly vindicated the delicacy of his taste by the enthusiastic bonmot that he had rather be the thersites of homer than the achilles of chaerilus  note iv verse     when grave bossu by systems studied laws the grecian bards ideal picture draws though bossu is called the best explainer of aristotle and one of the most learned and judicious of modern critics by a writer for whose opinions i have much esteem i cannot help thinking that his celebrated essay on epic poetry is very ill calculated either to guide or to inspirit a young poet the absurdity of his advice concerning the mode of forming the fable by choosing a moral inventing the incidents and then searching history for names to suit them has been sufficiently exposed and as to his leading idea concerning the design of homer in the composition of the iliad and odyssey i apprehend most poetical readers must feel that he is probably mistaken for it is a conjectural point and placed beyond the possibility of decision perhaps few individuals differ more from each other in their modes of thinking by the force of education and of national manners than a modern french critic and an early poet of greece yet the former will often pretend with the most decisive air to lay open the sensorium of an ancient bard and to count every link in the chain of his ideas those who are most acquainted with the movements of imagination will acknowledge the steps of this airy power to be so light and evanescent in their nature that perhaps a poet himself in a few years after finishing his work might be utterly unable to recollect the exact train of thought or the various minute occurrences which led him to the general design or directed him in the particular parts of his poem but in spite of the interval of so many centuries the decisive magic of criticism can call up all the shadows of departed thought that ever existed in his brain and display with a most astonishing clearness the precise state of his mind in the moment of composition  homere says bossu  livre i chap   voyoit les grecs pour qui il ecrivoit divisez en autant detats quils avoient de villes considerables chacune faisoit un corpse a part and avoit sa form de gouvernement independamment de toutes les autres et toutefois ces etats differens etoient souvent obligez de se reunir comme en un seul corpse contre leurs ennemis communs voila sans doubt deux sorts de gouvernemens bien differens pour etre commodement reunis en un corpse de morale and en un seul poem  le poet en a donc fait deux fables separees lune est pour toute la greece reunie en un seul corpse mais composee de parties independantes les unes des autres comme else etoient en effet and lautre est pour chaque etat particulier tells quils etoient pendant la paix sans ce premier rapport and sans la necessite de se reunir  homere a donc pris pour le fond de sa fable cette grande verite que la mesintelligence des princes ruin leurs propres etats    on the odyssey bossu remarks que la verite qui sert de fond a cette fiction and qui avec elle compose la fable est que labsence dune person horse de chez soi ou qui na point loeil a ce qui sy fait y cause de grands desordres livre i chap  0   on the mature consideration of these two moral axioms the critic supposes the sublime bard to have begun his respective poems for homer continues he  livre i chap    navoit point dautre dessein que de former agreablement les moeurs de ses citoiens en leur proposant comme dit horace ce qui est utile ou pernicieux ce qui est honnete ou ce qui ne lest pas  il na entrepris de raconter aucune action particuliere dachille ou dulysse il a fait la fable et le dessein de ses poemes sans penser a ces princes and ensuite il leur a fait lhonneur de donner leurs noms aux heroes quil avoit feints  the preceding remarks of this celebrated critic have been frequently admired as an ingenious conjecture which most happily illustrates the real purpose of homer to me they appear so much the reverse that if i ventured to adopt any decided opinion on a point so much darkened by the clouds of antiquity i should rather incline to the idea which bossu affects to explode and suppose the poems of homer intended panegyrics on the very princes whom the critic affirms he never thought of while he was designing the works which have made them immortal  there is a striking passage on this subject in a dialogue of plato which i shall enlarge upon for two reasons  st as it proves that the latter persuasion concerning the purpose of homer was entertained at athens and  dly because it gives me a pleasing opportunity of supporting the learned madame dacier against an illgrounded censure of a late english critic in her preface to the odyssey she asserts that the judgment of antiquity decided in favor of the iliad and she appeals to part of the sentence in plato to which i have alluded as a proof of her assertion mr wood in a note to the introduction of his essay on homer endeavors to show the insufficiency of this proof and still farther to convince us that madame dacier was utterly mistaken in her sense of the passage to which she appealed if he ventures to contradict this learned lady he does not however insult her with that insolent pertness with which she is frequently treated in the notes to popes homer and which for the honor of our english poet i will not suppose to be his but though mr wood endeavors to support his opinion by argument i apprehend that he is himself mistaken and that madame dacier is perfectly right in understanding the words of socrates in their literal sense without the least mixture of irony it is true indeed that the aim of socrates in the course of the dialogue is to ridicule the presumption and ignorance of the sophist hippias in the most ironical manner but the particular speech on which madame dacier founds her opinion is a plain and simple address to eudicus before he enters on his debate with the sophist it turns on the most simple circumstance the truth of which eudicus could hardly be ignorant of namely the sentiments of his own father concerning the poems of homer as these sentiments are such as i believe most admirers of the ancient bard have entertained on the point in question i perfectly agree with madame dacier in thinking that socrates means to be literal and serious when he says to eudicus   plat hip min edit serrani tom i p     i have heard your father apemantus say that the iliad of homer was a finer poem than his odyssey and as far surpassed it in excellence as the virtue of achilles surpassed the virtue of ulysses for those two poems he said were purposely composed in honor of those two heroes the odyssey to show the virtues of ulysses the iliad those of achilles  platos lesser hippias translated by sydenham page     let us now return to bossu whose opinion concerning the purpose of homer we may venture to oppose supported as it is by an ingenious interpretation of some ambiguous passages in the poetics of aristotle and this opposition may be grounded not so much on the sentence which i have quoted from plato as on the probable conduct of epic composition in the early ages of poetry in such periods as produced the talents of virgil and of dryden when all the arts of refined flattery were perfectly understood we can easily conceive that they might both be tempted to compliment the reigning monarch under the mask of such heroic names as history could supply and their genius accommodate to their purpose we find accordingly that the roman bard is supposed to have drawn a flattering portrait of his emperor in the character of aeneas and that the english poet has with equal ingenuity enwrapt the dissolute charles the second in the jewish robes of king david but in so rude an age as we must admit that of homer to have been when the poet was certainly more the child of nature than of art when he had no history to consult perhaps no patron to flatter and no critics to elude or obey in such an age may we not more naturally conjecture that poetical composition was neither labored in its form nor deep in its design that instead of being the slow and systematic product of political reasoning it was the quick and artless offspring of a strong and vivifying fancy which brooding over the tales of tradition soon raised them into such life and beauty as must satisfy and enchant a warlike and popular audience ever ready to listen with delight to the heroic feats of their ancestors  if the learned bossu appears unfortunate in his system concerning the purpose of homer he may be thought still more so in his attempt to analyze the divinities of virgil for to throw new light on the convention of the gods in the opening of the tenth aeneid he very seriously informs us that  book v chap i venus is divine mercy or the love of god toward virtuous men and juno his justice  i cannot conclude these very free strictures on a celebrated author without bearing a pleasing testimony to the virtues of the man  bossu is allowed by the biographers of his country to have been remarkable for the mildest manners and most amiable disposition totally free from that imperious and bigoted attachment to speculative opinions which the science he cultivated is so apt to produce he endeared himself to boileau by a generous act of friendship that led to an intimacy between them which was dissolved only by the death of the former in    0  note v verse     imputes to virgil his own dark conceit as it requires much leisure to examine and more skill to unravel an intricate hypothesis twisted into a long and labored chain of quotation and argument the dissertation on the sixth book of virgil remained for some time unrefuted the public very quietly acquiesced in the strange position of its author that aeneass adventure to the infernal shades is no other than a figurative description of his initiation into the mysteries and particularly a very exact one of the spectacles of the eleusinian at length a superior but anonymous critic arose who in one of the most judicious and spirited essays that our nation has produced on a point of classical literature completely overturned this illfounded edifice and exposed the arrogance and futility of its assuming architect the essay i allude to is entitled critical observations on the sixth book of the aeneid printed for elmsly    0 and as this little publication is i believe no longer to be purchased the curious reader may thank me for transcribing a few of its most striking passages  having ridiculed with great spirit and propriety warburtons general idea of the aeneid as a political institute and his illsupported assertion that both the ancient and modern poets afforded virgil a pattern for introducing the mysteries into this famous episode the author proceeds to examine how far the critics hypothesis of initiation may be supported or overthrown by the text of the poet it is says he from extrinsical circumstances that we may expect the discovery of virgils allegory every one of these circumstances persuades me that virgil described a real not a mimic world and that the scene lay in the infernal shades and not in the temple of ceres the singularity of the cumaean shores must be present to every traveller who has once seen them to a superstitious mind the thin crust vast cavities sulphurous steams poisonous exhalations and fiery torrents may seem to trace out the narrow confine of the two worlds the lake avernus was the chief object of religious horror the black woods which surrounded it when virgil first came to naples were perfectly suited to feed the superstition of the people strabo l v p      it was generally believed that this deadly flood was the entrance of hell sil ital l xii  and an oracle was once established on its banks which pretended

undertaking  facilis descensus averni noctes atque dies patet atri janua ditis sed revocare gradum superasque evadere ad auras hoc opus hic labor est aeneid vi        these particulars are absolutely irreconcilable with the idea of initiation but perfectly agreeable to that of a real descent that every step and every instant may lead us to the grave is a melancholy truth the mysteries were only open at stated times a few days at most in the course of a year the mimic descent of the mysteries was laborious and dangerous the return to light easy and certain in real death this order is inverted  pauci quos aequus amavit jupiter aut ardens evexit ad aethera virtus diis geniti potuere aeneid vi      these heroes as we learn from the speech of aeneas were hercules orpheus castor and pollux theseus and pirithous of all these antiquity believed that before their death they had seen the habitations of the dead nor indeed will any of the circumstances tally with a supposed initiation the adventure of eurydice the alternate life of the brothers and the forcible intrusion of alcides theseus and pirithous would mock the endeavors of the most subtle critic who should try to melt them down into his favorite mysteries the exploits of hercules who triumphed over the king of terrors  tartareum ille manu custodem in vincla petivit ipsius a solio regis traxitque trementem aeneid vi      was a wild imagination of the greeks homer odyss l xi ver     apoll bib l ii c    but it was the duty of ancient poets to adopt and embellish these popular traditions and it is the interest of every man of taste to acquiesce in their poetical fictions  virgil has borrowed as usual from homer his episode of the infernal shades and as usual has infinitely improved what the grecian had invented if among a profusion of beauties i durst venture to point out the most striking beauties of the sixth book i should perhaps observe   that after accompanying the hero through the silent realms of night and chaos we see with astonishment and pleasure a new creation bursting upon us   that we examine with a delight which springs from the love of virtue the just empire of minos in which the apparent irregularities of the present system are corrected where the patriot who died for his country is happy and the tyrant who oppressed it is miserable   as we interest ourselves in the heros fortunes we share his feelings  the melancholy palinurus the wretched deiphobus the indignant dido the grecian kings who tremble at his presence and the venerable anchises who embraces his pious son and displays to his sight the future glories of his race all these objects affect us with a variety of pleasing sensations  let us for a moment obey the mandate of our great critic and consider these awful scenes as a mimic show exhibited in the temple of ceres by the contrivance of the priest or if he pleases of the legislator whatever was animated i appeal to every reader of taste whatever was terrible or whatever was pathetic evaporates into lifeless allegory  tenuem sine viribus umbram  dat inania verba dat sine mente sonum gressusque effingit euntis the end of philosophy is truth the end of poetry is pleasure i willingly adopt any interpretation which adds new beauties to the original i assist in persuading myself that it is just and could almost show the same indulgence to the critics as to the poets fiction but should a grave doctor lay out fourscore pages in explaining away the sense and spirit of virgil i should have every inducement to believe that virgils soul was very different from the doctors    having shown in this spirited manner how far the hypothesis of the critic is inconsistent with particular passages and with the general character of the poet the essayist proceeds to allege two simple reasons which persuade him that virgil has not revealed the secret of the eleusinian mysteries the first is his ignorance and the second his discretion the author then proves by very ingenious historical arguments  st that it is probable the poet was never initiated himself and  dly that if he were so it is more probable that he would not have violated the laws both of religion and of honor in betraying the secret of the mysteries particularly as that species of profanation is mentioned with abhorrence by a cotemporary poet  vetabo qui cereris sacrum vulgarit arcanae sub iisdem sit trabibus fragilemque mecum solvat phaselum hor l iii od   when horace composed the ode which contains the preceding passage the aeneid continues my author and particularly the sixth book were already known to the public donat in virgil propert l ii el xxv v     the detestation of the wretch who reveals the mysteries of ceres though expressed in general terms must be applied

hor l i od   l i sermon v ver    etc  nothing remains to say except that horace was himself ignorant of his friends allegorical meaning which the bishop of gloucester has since revealed to the world it may be so yet for my own part i should be very well satisfied with understanding virgil no better than horace did    such is the forcible reasoning of this ingenious and spirited writer i have been tempted to transcribe these considerable portions of his work by an idea perhaps an illfounded one that the circulation of his little pamphlet has not been equal to its merit but if it has been in any degree neglected by our country it has not escaped the researches or wanted the applause of a learned and judicious foreigner professor heyne the late accurate and accomplished editor of virgil has mentioned it in his comments to the sixth book of the aeneid with the honor it deserves he remarks indeed that the author has censured the learned prelate with some little acrimony paullo acrius quam velis but what lover of poetry unbiassed by personal connection can speak of warburton without some marks of indignation if i have also alluded to this famous commentator with a contemptuous asperity it arises from the persuasion that he has sullied the page of every poet whom he pretended to illustrate and that he frequently degraded the useful and generous profession of criticism into a mean instrument of personal malignity or to use the more forcible language of his greatest antagonist that he invested himself in the high office of inquisitor general and supreme judge of the opinions of the learned which he assumed and exercised with a ferocity and despotism without example in the republic of letters and hardly to be paralleled among the disciples of dominic letter to warburton by a late professor etc p    d edition  it is the just lot of tyrants to be detested and of all usurpers the literary despot is the least excusable as he has not the common tyrannical plea of necessity or interest to allege in his behalf for the prevalence of his edicts will be found to sink in proportion to the arbitrary tone with which they are pronounced the fate of warburton is a striking instance of this important truth what havoc has the course of very few years produced in that pile of imperious criticism which he had heaped together many of his notes on shakespeare have already resigned their place to the superior comments of more accomplished critics and perhaps the day is not far distant when the volumes of pope himself will cease to be a repository for the lumber of his friend the severest enemies of warburton must indeed allow that several of his remarks on his poetical patron are entitled to preservation by their use or beauty but the greater part i apprehend are equally destitute of both and how far the critic was capable of disgracing the poet must be evident to every reader who recollects that the nonsense in the essay on criticism where pegasus is made to snatch a grace which is justly censured by dr warton was first introduced into the poem by an arbitrary transposition of the editor  though arrogance is perhaps the most striking and characteristical defect in the composition of this assuming commentator he had certainly other critical failings of considerable importance and it may possibly be rendering some little service to the art which he professed to investigate the peculiarities in this singular writer which conspire to plunge him in the crowd of those evanescent critics if i may use such an expression whom his friend pope beheld in so clear a vision that he seems to have given us a prophetical portrait of his own commentator critics i saw that others names efface and fix their own with labor in the place their own like others soon their place resigned or disappeared and left the first behind i shall therefore hazard a few farther observations not only on this famous critic of our age and country but on the two greater names of antiquity to each of whom he has been declared superior by the partial voice of enthusiastic friendship i wish not to offend his most zealous adherents and though i cannot but consider him as a literary usurper i speak of him as a great historian said of more exalted tyrants sine ira et studio quorum causas procul habeo  there seem to be three natural endowments requisite in the formation of an accomplished critic  strong understanding lively imagination and refined sensibility the first was the characteristic of aristotle and by the consent of all ages he is allowed to have possessed it in a superlative degree may i be pardoned for the opinion that he enjoyed but a very moderate portion of the other two i would not absolutely say that he had neither fancy nor feeling but that his imagination was not brilliant and that his sensibility was not exquisite may i think be fairly presumed from the general tenor of his prose nor does the little relic of his poetry contradict the idea the two qualities in which aristotle may be supposed defective were the very two which peculiarly distinguish longinus who certainly wanted not understanding though he might not possess the philosophical sagacity of the stagyrite when considered in every point of view he appears the most consummate character among the critics of antiquity if warburton bore any resemblance to either of these mighty names i apprehend it must be to the former and perhaps in imagination he was superior to aristotle but of the three qualities which i have ventured to consider as requisite in the perfect critic i conceive him to have been miserably deficient in the last and certainly the most essential of the three for as the great commentator of horace has philosophically and truly remarked in a note to that poet feeling or sentiment is not only the surest but the sole ultimate arbiter of works of genius notes on the epistle to augustus ver   0  a man may possess an acute understanding and a lively imagination without being a found critic and this truth perhaps cannot be more clearly shown than in the writings of warburton his understanding was undoubtedly acute his imagination was lively but imagination and sentiment are by no means synonymous and he certainly wanted those finer feelings which constitute accuracy of discernment and a perfect perception of literary excellence in consequence of this defect instead of seizing the real sense and intended beauties of an author he frequently followed the caprices of his own active fancy which led him in quest of secret meanings and mysterious allusions these he readily found and his powers of understanding enabled him to dress them up in a plausible and specious form and to persuade many readers that he was what he believed himself to be the restorer of genuine criticism as a farther proof that he was destitute of refined sensibility i might allege the peculiarity of his diction which as dr johnson has very justly remarked is coarse and impure perhaps it may be found that in proportion as authors have enjoyed the quality which i suppose him to have wanted they have been more or less distinguished by the ease the elegance and the beauty of their language were i required to fortify this conjecture by examples i should produce the names of virgil and racine of fenelon and addison  that addison who though insulted by the commentator of pope with the names of an indifferent poet and a worse critic was i think as much superior to his insulter in critical taste and in solidity of judgment as he confessedly was in the harmony of his style and in all the finer graces of beautiful composition  note vi verse     it is said by one who with this candid claim has gained no fading wreath of critic fame these and the six subsequent lines allude to the following passage in dr wartons essay on pope i conclude these reflections with a remarkable fact  in no polished nation after criticism has been much studied and the rules of writing established has any very extraordinary work ever appeared this has visibly been the case in greece in rome and in france after aristotle horace and boileau had written their arts of poetry in our own country the rules of the drama for instance were never more completely understood than at present yet what uninteresting though faultless tragedies have we lately seen so much better is our judgment than our execution how to account for the fact here mentioned adequately and justly would be attended with all those difficulties that await discussions relative to the productions of the human mind and to the delicate and secret causes that influence them whether or no the natural powers be not confined and debilitated by that timidity and caution which is occasioned by a rigid regard to the dictates of art or whether that philosophical that geometrical and systematical spirit so much in vogue which has spread itself from the sciences even into polite literature by consulting only reason has not diminished and destroyed sentiment and made our poets write from and to the head rather than the heart or whether lastly when just models from which the rules have necessarily been drawn have once appeared succeeding writers by vainly and ambitiously striving to surpass those just models and to shine and surprise do not become stiff and forced and affected in their thoughts and diction wartons essay page  0   d edition  i admire this ingenious and modest reasoning but for the honor of that severer art which this pleasing writer has the happy talent to enliven and embellish i will venture to start some doubts concerning the fact itself for which he endeavors to account perhaps our acquaintance with those writings of greece and rome which were subsequent to aristotle and horace is not sufficiently perfect to decide the point either way in respect to those countries but with regard to france may we not assert that her poetical productions which arose after the publication of boileaus didactic essay are at least equal if not superior to those which preceded that period if the henriade of voltaire is not a fine epic poem it is allowed to be the best which the french have to boast not to mention the dramatic works of that extraordinary and universal author if this remarkable fact may indeed be found true i should rather suppose it to arise from the irritable nature of the poetic spirit so peculiarly averse to restraint and control the bard who could gallop his pegasus over a free and open plain might be eager to engage in so pleasing an exercise but he who observed the directionposts so thickly and so perversely planted that instead of assisting his career they must probably occasion his fall would easily be tempted to descend from his steed and to decline the course let me illustrate this conjecture by a striking fact in the very words of the poet just mentioned who was by no means deficient in poetical confidence and who has left us the following anecdote of himself in that pleasing little anonymous work entitled commentaire historique sur les oeuvres de lauteur de la henriade il lut un jour plusieurs chants de ce poem chez le jeune president de maisons son intime ami on limpatienta par des objections il jetta son manuscrit dans le feu le president henaut len retira avee peine souvenez vous lui dit mr henaut dans une de ses lettres que cest moi qui ai sauve la henriade et quil men a coute une belle pair de manchettes  to return to the essay on pope  i rejoice that the amiable critic has at length obliged the public with the conclusion of his most engaging and ingenious work he has the singular talent to instruct and to please even those readers who are most ready to revolt from the opinion which he endeavors to establish and he has in some degree atoned for that excess of severity which his first volume discovered and which sunk the reputation of pope in the eyes of many who judge not for themselves even far below that mortifying level to which he meant to reduce it had pope been alive to add this spirited essay to the bundle of writings against himself which he is said to have collected he must have felt that like the dagger of brutus it gave the most painful blow from the character of the assailant all the conspirators save only he did that they did in envy of great caesar he only in a general honest thought and common good to all made one of them yet pope ascended not the throne of poetry by usurpation but was seated there by a legal title of which i shall speak farther in a subsequent note  note vii verse     his hallowed subject by that law forbid might still have laid in silent darkness hid boileaus art of poetry made its first appearance in      six years after the publication of paradise lost the verses of the french poet to which i have particularly alluded are these cest donc bien vainement que nos auteurs decus bannissant de leurs verse ces ornemens recus pensent fair agir dieu ses saints et ses prophets comme ces dieux eclos du cerveau des poets mettent a chaque pas le lecteur en enfer noffrent rien qu astaroth belzebuth lucifer de la

coupable meme a ses verites done l air de la fable et quel object enfin a presenter aux yeux que le diable toujours hurlant contre les cieux qui de votre heroes veut rabaisser la gloire et souvent avec dieu balance la victoire poetique de despreaux chant iii ver     etc  the preceding lines which are said to have been levelled at the clovis of desmaretz appear so pointed against the subject of milton that we might almost believe them intended as a satire on our divine bard there is nothing in boileaus admirable didactic essay so liable to objection as the whole passage concerning epic poetry his patronage of the old pagan divinities and his oblique recommendation of classical heroes are alike exceptionable even a higher name than boileau has failed in framing precepts for the epic muse the maxims delivered by tasso himself in his discourse on epic poetry are so far from perfect that an agreeable and judicious french critic has very justly said of him sil eut mis sa theorie en pratique son poem nauroit pas tant de charms marmontel poetique francoise  i am not so vain as to think of succeeding in the point where these immortal authors have failed and i must beg my reader to remember that the present work is by no means intended as a code of laws for the epic poet it is not my design to write receipts how poems may be made for i think the writer who would condescend to frame this higher species of composition according to the exact letter of any directions whatever may be most properly referred to that admirable receipt for an epic poem with which martinus scriblerus will happily supply him my serious desire is to examine and refute the prejudices which have produced as i apprehend the neglect of the heroic muse i wish to kindle in our poets a warmer sense of national honor with ambition to excel in the noblest province of poesy if my essay should excite that generous enthusiasm in the breast of any young poetic genius so far from wishing to confine him by any arbitrary dictates of my own imagination i should rather say to him in the words of dantes virgil non aspettar mio dir piu ne mio cenno libero dritto sano e tuo arbitrio e fallo

vol ii page     end of the notes to the first epistle notes to the second epistle note i verse    we see thy fame traduced by gallic wit homer like most transcendent characters has found detractors in every age we learn from a passage in the life of socrates by diogenes laertius that the great poet had in his lifetime an adversary named sagaris or syagrus and his calumniator zoilus is proverbially distinguished in the greek anthologia there is a sepulchral inscription on a slanderer of the sovereign bard which for its enthusiastic singularity i shall present to the reader           anthologia p  0 edit oxon      on parthenius the phocensian who calumniated homer here though deepburied he can rail no more pour burning pitch on base parthenius pour who on the sacred muses dared to spirt his frothy venom and poetic dirt who said of homer in his frantic scorn the odyssey was mud the iliad thorn for this dark furies in your snakes enroll and through cocytus drag the slandrous soul   parthenius say the commentators was a disciple of dionysius of alexandria who flourished under nero and trajan erycius the author of the inscription is supposed to have lived in the same age  among the modern adversaries of homer the french are most remarkable for their severity and injustice nor is it surprising that the nation which has displayed the faintest sparks of epic fire should be the most solicitous to reduce the oppressive splendour of this exalted luminary the most depreciating remarks on genius in every walk are generally made by those who are the least able to prove its rivals and often perhaps not so much from the prevalence of envious malignity as from the want of vivid and delicate perception the merits and the failings of homer were agitated in france with all the heat and acrimony of a theological dispute madame dacier distinguished herself in the contest by her uncommon talents and erudition she combated for the grecian bard with the spirit of minerva defending the father of the gods it must however be confessed that she sometimes overstepped the modesty of wisdom and caught unwarily the scolding tone of juno it is indeed amusing to observe a people who pique themselves on their extreme politeness and censure homer for the gross behavior of his gods engaging among themselves in a squabble concerning this very poet with all the unrefined animosity of his olympian synod in the whole controversy there is nothing more worthy of remembrance and of praise than the lively elegance and the pleasing good humor of mr de la motte who though not one of the most exalted was certainly one of the most amiable characters in the literary world and made a generous return to the severity of his female antagonist by writing an ode in her praise voltaire has pointed out with his usual spirit the failings of la motte in his abridgement of the iliad but he has frequently fallen himself into similar defects and is equally unjust to homer against whom he has levelled the most bitter sarcasms both in prose and verse voltaire attacking homer is like paris shooting his arrow at the heel of achilles the two poets are as unequal as the two ancient warriors yet homer like achilles may have his vulnerable spot but with this happy difference that although the shaft of ridicule which is pointed against him may be tinged with venom its wound cannot be mortal perhaps no better answer can be made to all those who amuse themselves with writing against homer than the following reply of madame dacier to the abbe terrasson who had attacked her favorite bard in two abusive volumes  que monsieur l abbe terrasson trouve homere sot ridicule extravagant ennuyeux cest son affair le public jugera si cest un defaut a homere de deplaire a m l abbe terrasson ou a m l abbe terrasson de ne pas gouter homere  note ii verse    even socrates himself that purest sage imbibed his wisdom from thy moral page dio chrysostom in one of his orations has called socrates the disciple of homer and drawn a short parallel of their respective merits observing in honor of both  dion chrysostom p      note iii verse     how high soever she leads his daring flight etc i mean not to injure the dignity of pindar by this assertion though quinctilian in drawing the character of the grecian lyric poets has given him high preeminence in that choir we may i think very fairly conjecture that some odes of alcaeus and stesichorus were not inferior to those of the theban bard who is said to have been repeatedly vanquished in a poetical contest by his female antagonist corinna the absurd jealousy of our sex concerning literary talents has led some eminent writers to question the merits of corinna as olearius has observed in his dissertation on the female poets of greece but her glory seems to have been fully established by the public memorial of her picture exhibited in her native city and adorned with a symbol of her victory pausanias who saw it supposes her to have been one of the handsomest women of her time and the ingenuity of some critics imputes her success in the poetical contest to the influence of her beauty they have taken some liberties less pardonable with her literary reputation and by their curious comments on a single greek syllable made the sublime pindar call his fair rival a sow though the unfortunate word  which may be twisted into that meaning signifies in its more obvious construction that the poet challenged his successful antagonist to a new trial of skill  for a more minute account of this singular piece of criticism i must refer the reader to the notes on corinna in the fragmenta poetriarum by wolfius time has left us only a few diminutive scraps of corinnas poetry but plutarch in his treatise on the glory of the athenians has preserved one of her critical bonmots which may deserve to be repeated that author asserts that corinna instructed pindar in his youth and advised him to adorn his composition with the embellishments of fable the obedient poet soon brought her some verses in which he had followed her advice rather too freely when his tutress smiling at his profusion   note iv verse     yet may not judgment with severe disdain slight the young rhodians variegated strain apollonius surnamed the rhodian from the place of his residence is supposed to have been a native of alexandria where he is said to have recited some portion of his poem while he was yet a youth finding it ill received by his countrymen he retired to rhodes where he is conjectured to have polished and completed his work supporting himself by the profession of rhetoric and receiving from the rhodians the freedom of their city he at length returned with considerable honor to the place of his birth succeeding eratosthenes in the care of the alexandrian library in the reign of ptolemy euergetes who ascended the throne of egypt in the year before christ     that prince had been educated by the famous aristarchus and rivalled the preceding sovereigns of his liberal family in the munificent encouragement of learning apollonius was a disciple of the poet callimachus but their connection ended in the most violent enmity which was probably owing to some degree of contempt expressed by apollonius for the light compositions of his master the learned have vainly endeavored to discover the particulars of their quarrel  the only work of apollonius which has descended to modern times is his poem in four books on the argonautic expedition both longinus and quinctilian have assigned to this work the mortifying character of mediocrity but there lies an appeal from the sentence of the most candid and enlightened critics to the voice of nature and the merit of apollonius has little to apprehend from the decision of this ultimate judge his poem abounds in animated description and in passages of the most tender and pathetic beauty how finely painted is the first setting forth of the argo and how beautifully is the wife of chiron introduced holding up the little achilles in her arms and showing him to his father peleus as he sailed along the shore but the chief excellence in our poet is the spirit and delicacy with which he has delineated the passion of love in his medea that virgil thought very highly of his merit in this particular is sufficiently evident from the minute exactness with which he has copied many tender touches of the grecian poet those who compare the third book of apollonius with the fourth of virgil may i think perceive not only that dido has some features of medea but that the two bards however different in their reputation resembled each other in their genius and that they both excel in delicacy and pathos  note v verse   0 virgil sinks loaded with their heavy praise scaliger appears to be the most extravagant of all the critics who have lavished their undistinguishing encomiums on virgil by asserting that he alone is entitled to the name of poet poetices lib iii c    though the opinion of spence and other modern critics concerning the character of aeneas considered as an allegorical portrait of augustus seems to gain ground yet it might perhaps be easy to overturn the ingenious conjectures and the fanciful reasoning by which that idea has been supported this attempt would have the sanction of one of the most judicious commentators of virgil for the learned heyne expressly rejects all allegorical interpretation and thinks it improbable that a poet of so correct a judgment could have adopted a plan which must necessarily contract and cramp his powers he even ventures to assert that if the character of aeneas was delineated as an allegorical portrait of augustus the execution of it is unhappy the strongest argument which has been adduced to support this conjecture is founded on the ingenious interpretation of the following passage in the opening of the third georgic primus ego in patriam mecum modo vita supersit aonio rediens deducam vertice musas primus idumaeas referam tibi mantua palmas et viridi in campo templum de marmore ponam propter aquam tardis ingens ubi flexibus errat mincius et tenera praetexit arundine ripas in medio mihi caesar erit templumque tenebit etc   these lines in which virgil expresses his intention of dedicating a temple to augustus have been considered as the noblest allegory of ancient poetry hurds horace vol ii page     and the great critic who first started the idea has expatiated in the triumph of his discovery on the mysterious beauties they contain but the whole of this hypothesis is unfortunately built upon the rejection of three verses which are pronounced unworthy of the poet and which though found in every ms the critic claims a right of removing a license so extraordinary cannot even be justified by the talents of this accomplished writer for if the less elegant passages of the ancient poets might be removed at pleasure their compositions would be exposed to the caprice of every fantastic commentator the obvious and literal interpretation not only renders this violence unnecessary but is more agreeable to the judgment of the poet and the manners of his age the custom of erecting real temples was so familiar to antiquity that a roman would never have suspected the edifice was to be raised only with poetical materials we may even conjecture from a line of statius that the poet himself had a temple erected to his memory and without any breach of probability we may admit his intention of giving his living emperor such a testimony of his gratitude this adulation though shocking to us was too generally justified by example to oblige the poet to palliate it by a fiction he had before acquiesced in the divinity of his imperial patron and had expressed the idea in its full sense namque erit ille mihi semper deus illius aram saepe tener nostris ab ovilibus imbuet agnus eclog i ingredere et votis jam nunc assuesce vocari georg i  having made such an invocation in the beginning of his work was his delicacy afterward to be shocked and oblige him to pay a compliment under the disguise of an obscure conceit for that allegory must be allowed to be obscure which had remained through so many ages unexplained the unfortunate rejected lines for whose elegance we do not contend may at least be rescued from impropriety by a literal interpretation of the preceding passage for dismiss the conjectured allegory and the chief objections against them remain no longer if the phraseology be peculiar it is at least supported by concurring mss the adjective ardens is sometimes undoubtedly joined to a word that does not denote a substance of heat or flame as the critic himself admits in the case of ardentes hosts to which we may add the verbum ardens of cicero a friend who possesses much elegant erudition has remarked to me that the learned prelate is particularly unhappy in his assertion respecting the use of the word ardens  an assertion completely contradicted by the following passages from lucretius and virgil vulneris ardenti ut morsu premat icta dolor lucret lib iii ver     quos ardens evexit ad aethera virtus aeneid vi   0  as to the line which is said to contain the most glaring note of illegitimacy tithoni prima quot abest ab origin caesar many reasons might induce the poet to use the name of tithonus which at this distance of time it is not easy for us to conjecture perhaps he chose it to vary the expression of assaraci proles which he had adopted in the preceding lines the absurdity of the subject matter and the place in which it is introduced that are insisted on as the principal objections arise solely from the allegorical hypothesis without it the construction will be plain and natural the poet expresses his intention of erecting a temple to augustus and expatiates on the magnificence with which it was to be adorned he then returns to his present poetical subject  interea dryadum sylvas saltusque sequamur  and having dwelt a little on that to avoid too long a digression very naturally resumes the praises of the emperor by alluding to the sublimer song which he intended to devote to him hereafter mox tamen ardentes accingar dicere pugnas caesaris    perhaps the important position that gave rise to this conjecture and to others of a similar complexion that the propriety of allegorical composition made the distinguished pride of ancient poetry is as questionable as the conjecture itself and a diligent and judicious perusal of the ancient poets might convince us that simplicity was their genuine character and that many of their allegorical beauties have originated in the fertile imagination of their commentators aristarchus indeed the celebrated model of ancient criticism rejected with great spirit the allegorical interpretations of homer as we are informed by eusthathius but the good archbishop of thessalonica who like some modern prelates had a passion for allegory censures the great critic of alexandria for his more simple mode of construction and supposes it an injury to the refined beauties and profound wisdom of the poet  eusth vol iii page   00  having considered in this note some conjectures on virgil that appear to me fantastical and ill founded i am tempted to produce two illustrations of the same great poet which if i am not deceived by friendship reflect more light and honor on the first of the roman poets at all events they will be esteemed as a literary curiosity by the reader when i tell him they were written by a critic whose name is doubly entitled to respect in the republic of letters from his own taste and erudition and from the poetical genius of his daughter  in the early part of his life mr seward of lichfield had thoughts of publishing a translation of virgil in blank verse among his remarks on different passages of his author the two following appeared to me particularly happy and i transcribe them from the papers of my worthy old friend in the persuasion that every lover of virgil will peruse them with pleasure  there are two passages in the aeneid which seem to me misunderstood by all the commentators and translators from the age of the roman classics to the present and yet when properly explained they will i hope appear beautiful clear and almost indisputable i shall mention them as they occurred to me the first of these lines is in the eighth book of the aeneid verse     it is in the prophetic description of the battle of actium between augustus and antony carved by vulcan on the shield of aeneas  arva nova neptunia caede rubescunt regina in mediis patrio vocat agmina sistro necdum etiam geminos a tergo respicit angues omnigenumque deum monstra et latrator anubis contra neptunum et venerem contraque minervam tela tenent saevit medio in certamine mavors caelatus ferro tristesque ex aethere dirae et scissa gaudens vadit discordia palla quam cum sanguineo sequitur bellona flagello the difficulty in this passage is to know what and where the two prophetic snakes were behind cleopatras back most commentators say that they were carved upon her shield which hung upon her back but surely this could not be designed by virgil if he meant to represent cleopatra in armor as he undoubtedly did he would not have hung her shield behind her back in the hour of battle in the next place why does he give her two serpents when both her sculptors painters and historians give her only one the bite of which in that country of venomous creatures was quite sufficient to slay her nor would virgil the model of perspicuity express himself so confusedly as to talk of her turning her eyes to what is carved upon her own back if the reader is convinced that the passage wants perspicuity he will be pleased to find the whole cleared up by observing that the two snakes were on the caduceus of anubis which consisted of a dogs head on a human figure with a caduceus in one hand on the top of which were two beautifully curling asps or snakes and a purse or a porridge pot in his left le pluche  from whence the greeks perhaps without knowing the meaning of this emblem took their mercury they discarded the dogs head as unsightly and placed a human one in its stead by which they destroyed the emblematic figures though they left the name of latrator or barker sufficient to lead us to its real meaning which was that of the dog star the rising of which just preceded the overflow of the nile as soon therefore as the astronomers of egypt could discern the dog star risen in the spring they gave notice of it by their anubis or dog which was hung out on their several towers that all the people might fly to their terraces and places of safety but if clouds had before obstructed the view of the star and it was risen high before it was discerned they added wings to his feet and shoulders put his caduceus in his right hand and a porridge pot or purse in his left to hurry the people in their preparations against the deluge virgil therefore in describing cleopatra in her ship evidently supposes the name of her ship to have been anubis whose image was carved on the poop of it holding his caduceus behind cleopatra the rest of the egyptian fleet having omnigenum deum monstra other egyptian deities on their poops who contra neptunum et venerem contraque minervam tela tenent  that is the egyptian ships and roman were ranged in battle against each other cana fides et vesta remo cum fratre quirinus jura dabunt  aeneid i ver     scarce any passage in virgil has given me greater trouble took longer time or gave me greater pleasure in the discovery than this the difficulty was to know how virgil came to choose romulus and remus the one the murderer of the other as the joint legislators of a new golden age of peace and prosperity much historical knowledge has been in vain applied to form many strange interpretations with which the critics themselves are plainly dissatisfied much the most plausible is that of ruaeus that  cana fides was the ancient faith of citizens to each other vesta religion and romulus and remus the power of the princes united as legislators but how a fratricide could represent such an union would be strange indeed  i will not detain the reader with enumerating the many absurd conjectures of interpretation but shall only mention some facts relating to a new solution first this book of virgil was evidently written soon after the battle of actium when antony being subdued the whole world seemed at peace and augustus shut the gate of janus mecaenas was his favorite minister and praetor urbanus and had just then with wonderful sagacity discovered and suppressed a conspiracy against the emperors life on his return in triumph to rome one of the principal actors in this conspiracy was the son of the late triumvir lepidus whom with several other conspirators he had unknown each to the other seized imprisoned and privately destroyed without any noise or public disturbance the knowledge of this recent fact makes it still more surprising that virgil who is full of compliments to his patron in most of his other works should in his principal poem totally omit speaking of him unless he is supposed to have represented him by the character of fidus achates which amounts to no more than that of lighting a fire to dry their clothes and their corn after a storm or to bring ascanius to his father to partake of didos entertainment i hope to prove that virgils supposed neglect of his friend is not true and that he is in the line above elegantly and judiciously complimented as also very intelligibly so to all who knew the history of this conspiracy and that mecaenas was praetor urbanus with a power equal if not superior to our lord chief justice and our lord chancellor conjoined it occurred to me many years before i knew any proof of it that cana fides et vesta et remo cum fratre quirinus were the names of those temples where mecaenas held his beds of justice in the same manner as in the former note anubis and deorum monstra were only the names of the egyptian ships opposed to those of the romans named mercury venus and minerva i had many years a strong suspicion of this when accidentally reading horaces epistle ibam forte via sacra i found that the temple of vesta was employed by mecaenas for trials of civil causes see sat ix book i  having therefore found my conjecture with regard to the temple of vesta verified i pursued my search to the others viz of romulus and remus and of fides the first i found to be the place of trial and punishment of criminals and the next to be the temple where the tablets of all the senatus consulta were hung up and which in caesars time were so numerous that the walls of the temple could not contain them and therefore an additional building was erected this therefore seems extremely proper to accompany the seats of judicature the compliment to mecaenas is this when civil wars shall cease and all power regal consular and tribunitial center in augustus his friend and favorite mecaenas shall be praetor urbanus who shall rule by the equitable laws suspended in the ancient temple of fides shall decide civil causes in the temple and grove of vesta and criminal ones in the temple of romulus and remus the foundation walls of which still remain and on them is built a modern temple dedicated to two brother saints  roma antica  all this would be clearly understood by those who knew the ample powers conferred on mecaenas by his judicial office of praetor urbanus  note vi verse   0 shall historys pen to aid his vengeance won there is hardly any eminent personage of antiquity who has suffered more from detraction both in his literary and moral character than the poet lucan his fate indeed seems in all points to have been peculiarly severe his early death at an age when few poets have even laid the foundation of their capital work is itself sufficient to excite our compassion and regret but to perish by the envious tyranny of nero may be considered as a blessing when compared with the more cruel misfortune of being branded with infamy in the immortal pages of tacitus as i am persuaded that the great historian has inadvertently adopted the grossest calumny against our poet i shall most readily assign my reasons for thinking so it may first be proper to give a short sketch of lucans life  he was the son of anneus mela the youngest brother of seneca and though born at corduba was conveyed to rome at the age of eight months a circumstance as his more indulgent critics observe which sufficiently refutes the censure of those who consider his language as provincial at rome he was educated under the stoic cornutus so warmly celebrated by his disciple persius the satirist who was the intimate friend of our poet in the close of his education lucan is said to have passed some time at athens on his return to rome he rose to the office of quaestor before he had attained the legal age he was afterward enrolled among the augurs and married a lady of noble birth of whose amiable character i shall speak more at large in a subsequent note lucan had for some time been admitted to familiarity with nero when the emperor chose to contend for poetical honors by the public recital of a poem he had composed on niobe and some verses of this imperial production are supposed to be preserved in the first satire of persius lucan had the hardiness to repeat a poem on orpheus in competition with that of nero and what is more remarkable the judges of the contest were just and bold enough to decide against the emperor from hence nero became the persecutor of his successful rival and forbade him to produce any poetry in public the wellknown conspiracy of piso against the tyrant soon followed and tacitus with his usual sarcastic severity concludes that lucan engaged in the enterprise from the poetical injuries he had received a remark which does little credit to the candor of the historian who might have found a much nobler and i will add a more probable motive for his conduct in the generous ardour of his character and his passionate adoration of freedom in the sequel of his narration tacitus alleges a charge against our poet which if it were true must lead us to detest him as the most abject of mankind the historian asserts that lucan when accused of the conspiracy for some time denied the charge but corrupted at last by a promise of impunity and desirous to atone for the tardiness of his confession accused his mother atilla as his accomplice this circumstance is so improbable in itself and so little consonant to the general character of lucan that some writers have treated it with contempt as a calumny invented by nero to vilify the object of his envious abhorrence but the name of tacitus has given such an air of authority to the story that it may seem to deserve a more serious discussion particularly as there are two subsequent events related by the same historian which have a tendency to invalidate the accusation so injurious to our poet the events i mean are the fate of annaeus and the escape of atilla the two parents of lucan the former died in consequence of an accusation brought against him after the death of his son by fabius romanus who had been intimate with lucan and forged some letters in his name with the design of proving his father concerned in the conspiracy these letters were produced to nero who sent them to annaeus from an eager desire says tacitus to get possession of his wealth from this fact two inferences may be drawn according to the different lights in which it may be considered  if the accusation against annaeus was just it is clear that lucan had not betrayed his father and he appears the less likely to have endangered by his confession the life of a parent to whom he owed a still tenderer regard  if annaeus was not involved in the conspiracy and merely put to death by nero for the sake of his treasure we may the more readily believe that the tyrant who murdered the father from avarice might calumniate the son from envy but the escape of atilla affords us the strongest reason to conclude that lucan was perfectly innocent of the abject and unnatural treachery of which tacitus has supposed him guilty had the poet really named his mother as his accomplice would the vindictive and sanguinary nero have spared the life of a woman whose family he detested particularly when other females were put to death for their share in the conspiracy that atilla was not in that number the historian himself informs us in the following remarkable sentence atilla matter annaei lucani sine absolutione sine supplicio dissimulata thus translated by gordon the information against atilla the mother of lucan was dissembled and without being cleared she escaped unpunished  the preceding remarks will i hope vindicate to every candid mind the honor of our poet whose firmness and intrepidity of character are indeed very forcibly displayed in that picture of his death which tacitus himself has given us i shall present it to the english reader in the words of gordon  lucan while his blood issued in streams perceiving his feet and hands to grow cold and stiffen and life to retire by little and little to the extremities while his heart was still beating with vital warmth and his faculties no wise impaired recollected some lines of his own which described a wounded soldier expiring in a manner that resembled this the lines themselves he rehearsed and they were the last words he ever uttered the annals of tacitus book xv  the critics differ concerning the verses of the pharsalia which the author quoted in so memorable a manner i shall transcribe the two passages he is supposed to have repeated and only add that lipsius contends for the latter sanguis erant lacrymae quaecunque foramina novit humor ab his largus manat cruor ora redundant et patulae nares sudor rubet omnia plenis membra fluunt venis totum est pro vulnere corpus lib ix     now the warm blood at once from every part ran purple poison down and drained the fainting heart blood falls for tears and over his mournful face the ruddy drops their tainted passage trace wherever the liquid juices find a way there streams of blood there crimson rivers stray his mouth and gushing nostrils pour a flood and even the pores ouze out the trickling blood in the red deluge all the parts lie drowned and the whole body seems one bleeding wound row scinditur avulsus nec sicut vulnere sanguis emicuit lentus ruptis cadit undique venis discursusque animae diversa in membra meantis interceptus aquis lib iii v     no single wound the gaping rupture seems where trickling crimson wells in slender streams but from an opening horrible and wide a thousand vessels pour the bursting tide at once the winding channels course was broke where wandering life her mazy journey took at once the currents all forgot their way and lost their purple in the azure sea row such was the death of lucan before he had completed his twentyseventh year if his character as a man has been injured by the historian his poetical reputation has been treated not less injuriously by the critics quintilian by a frivolous distinction disputes his title to be classed among the poets and scaliger says with a brutality of language disgraceful only to himself that he seems rather to bark than to sing but these insults may appear amply compensated when we remember that in the most polished nations of modern europe the most elevated and poetic spirits have been his warmest admirers that in france he was idolized by corneille and in england translated by row  the severest censures on lucan have proceeded from those who have unfairly compared his language to that of virgil but how unjust and absurd is such a comparison it is comparing an uneven block of porphyry taken rough from the quarry to the most beautiful superficies of polished marble how differently should we think of virgil as a poet if we possessed only the verses which he wrote at that period of life when lucan composed his pharsalia in the disposition of his subject in the propriety and elegance of diction he is undoubtedly far inferior to virgil but if we attend to the bold originality of his design and to the vigor of his sentiments if we consider the pharsalia as the rapid and uncorrected sketch of a young poet executed in an age when the spirit of his countrymen was broken and their taste in literature corrupted it may justly be esteemed as one of the most noble and most wonderful productions of the human mind  note vii verse     as lesbos paid to pompeys lovely wife pompey after his defeat at pharsalia proceeded to lesbos as he had left his wife cornelia to the protection of that island which received the unfortunate hero with a sublime generosity the lesbians entreated him to remain amongst them and promised to defend him pompey expressed his gratitude for their fidelity but declined the offer and embarked with cornelia the concern of this gallant people on the departure of their amiable guest is thus described by lucan  dixit moestamque carinae imposuit comitem cunctos mutare putares tellurem patriaeque solum sic litore toto plangitur infestae tenduntur in aethera dextrae pompeiumque minus cujus fortuna dolorem moverat ast illam quam toto tempore belli ut civem videre suam discedere cernens ingemuit populus quam vix si castra mariti victoris peteret siccis dimittere matres jam poterant oculis tanto devinxit amore hos pudor hos probitas castique modestia vultus lib viii v     he ceased and to the ship his partner bore while loud complainings fill the sounding shore it seemed as if the nation with her passed and banishment had laid their island waste their second sorrows they to pompey give for her as for their citizen they grieve even though glad victory had called her thence and her lords bidding been the just pretense the lesbian matrons had in tears been drowned and brought her weeping to their watery bound so was she loved so winning was her grace such lowly sweetness dwelt upon her face row  note viii verse     let argentaria on your canvass shine polla argentaria was the daughter of a roman senator and the wife of lucan she is said to have transcribed and corrected the three first books of the pharsalia after the death of her husband it is much to be regretted that we possess not the poem which he wrote on the merits of this amiable and accomplished woman but her name is immortalized by two surviving poets of that age the veneration which she paid to the memory of her husband is recorded by martial and more poetically described in that pleasing and elegant little production of statius genethliacon lucani a poem which i the more readily commend as i may be thought by some readers unjust toward its author in omitting to celebrate his thebaid i confess indeed the miscellaneous poems of statius appear to me his most valuable work in most of these there is much imagination and sentiment in harmonious and spirited verse the little poem which i have mentioned on the anniversary of lucans birth is said to have been written at the request of argentaria the author after invoking the poetical deities to attend the cereomy touches with great delicacy and spirit on the compositions of lucans childhood which are lost and the pharsalia the production of his early youth he then pays a short compliment to the beauty and talents of argentaria laments the cruel fate which deprived her so immaturely of domestic happiness and concludes with the following address to the shade of lucan at tu seu rapidum poli per axem famae curribus arduis levatus qua surgunt animae potentiores terras despicis et sepulchra rides seu pacis meritum nemus reclusae felix elysiis tenes in oris quo pharsalica turba congregatur et te nobile carmen insonantem pompeii comitantur et catones tu magna sacer et superbus umbra nescis tartaron et procul nocentum audis verbera pallidumque visa matris lampade respicis neronem adsis lucidus et vocante polla unum quaeso diem deos silentum exores solet hoc patere limen ad nuptas redeuntibus maritis haec te non thiasis procax dolosis falsi numinis induit figuras ipsum sed colit et frequentat ipsum imis altius insitum medullis ac solatia vana subministrat vultus qui simili notatus auro stratis praenitet excubatque somno securae procul hinc abite mortes haec vitae genitalis est origo cedat luctus atrox genisque manent jam dulces lacrymae dolorque festus quicquid fleverat ante nunc adoret but you o whether to the skies on fames triumphant car you rise where mightier souls new life assume and mock the confines of the tomb or whether in elysium blessed you grace the groves of sacred rest where the pharsalian heroes dwell and as you strike your epic shell the pompeys and the catos throng to catch the animating song of tartarus the dread control binds not your high and hallowed soul distant you hear that wailing coast and see the guilty neros ghost grow pale with anguish and affright his mother flashing on his sight be present to your pollas vows while to your honored name she bows one day let your entreaties gain from those who rule the shadowy train their gates have opened to bless a wife and given a husband back to life in you the tender fair invites no fancied god with frantic rites you are the object of her prayers you in her inmost heart she bears and stamped on mimic gold your head adorns the faithful mourners bed and sooths her eyes before they close the guardian of her chaste repose away with all funereal state from hence his nobler life we date let mourning change the pang severe to fond devotions grateful tear and festal grief its anguish over what it lamented now adore   i cannot close this note without observing that the preceding verses have a strong tendency to prove that lucan was perfectly innocent in regard to the accusation which i have examined before had he been really guilty of basely endangering the life of his mother it is not probable that his wife would have honored his memory with such enthusiastic veneration or that statius in verses designed to do him honor would have alluded to the mother of nero the reader will pardon my recurring to this subject as it is pleasing to make use of every argument which may remove so odious and unjust a stain from a manly and exalted character  end of the third volume
