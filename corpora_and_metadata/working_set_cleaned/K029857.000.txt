london sept        the case of samuel richardson of london printer with regard to the invasion of his property in the history of sir charles grandison before publication by certain booksellers in dublin the editor of the history of sir charles grandison had intended to send the volumes of it as he did those of the history of clarissa harlowe to be printed in ireland before he published them himself in london accordingly when he had printed off so considerable a part of the work as would have constantly employed the press to which he purposed to consign them he sent over    sheets of the first volume to mr george faulkner intending to follow it with the rest as opportunity offered  he had heard an irish bookseller boast some years ago that he could procure from any printingoffice in london sheets of any book printing in it while it was going on and before publication and mr faulkner cautioning him on this subject with regard to this work he took particular care to prevent as he hoped the effects of such an infamous corruption as it must be called since it could not be done but by bribing the journeymen or servants of the london printer he gave a strict charge before he put the piece to press to all his workmen and servants as well in print that it might the stronger impress them as by word of mouth to be on their guard against any outdoor attacks this was the substance of the printed caution which he gave to his workmen on this occasion a bookseller of dublin has assured me that he could get the sheets of any book from any printing house in london before publication i hope i may depend upon the care and circumspection of my friends compositors and pressmen that no sheets of the piece i am now putting to press be carried out of the house nor any notice taken of its being at press it is of great consequence to me let no stranger be admitted into any of the workrooms once more i hope i may rely on the integrity and care of all my workmen  and let all the proofs revises etc be given to mr tewley his foreman to take care of  he had no reason to distrust their assurances most of them being persons of experienced honesty and was pleased with their declared abhorrence of so vile a treachery and of all those who should attempt to corrupt them yet to be still more secure as he thought he ordered the sheets as they were printed off to be deposited in a separate warehouse the care of which was entrusted to one on whom he had laid such obligations as if he is guilty has made his perfidy a crime of the blackest nature peter bishop whose business was to read proofs to the corrector and to employ his leisure hours in the warehouses and who and no other person being entrusted with the sheets of sir charles grandison as wrought off and to layby three sheets of each of the twelves edition and one of the octavo for mr richardsons sole use had an opportunity which no other man however inclined could have to perpetrate this baseness  mr richardson on suspicions too wellgrounded dismissed bishop from his service and after he was gone having reason to suspect thomas killingbeck one of his compositors as the confederate of bishop and by whose means he having worked some years in ireland it was easy for him to manage this piece of treachery and killingbeck on examination giving him cause to strengthen his suspicions yet asserting his innocence he proposed to him the said killingbeck to draw up himself such an affidavit as he thought he could safely take to exculpate himself killingbeck made poor excuses and pretenses but at last took till the next morning to draw it up the next morning he told mr richardson that he was advised not to draw up such an affidavit and gave such evasive reasons as induced every body to believe him guilty upon this mr richardson discharged him from his service he left his house pretending he would draw up something as desired but never since came near it and is now applying for work elsewhere  since writing the above mr richardson has received a letter from bishop on occasion of some friend of his advising him to an ample confession and to depend on that forgiving temper which he had before experienced in which he offers circumstances to prove that killingbeck might find opportunities to steal the sheets without his connivance though were that the case none after such repeated warnings and cautions to clear himself of the most culpable negligence    having three printinghouses he had them composed and wrought by different workmen and at his different houses and took such other precautions that the person to whose trust he committed them being frequently questioned by him as to the safety of the work from pirates as frequently assured him that it was impossible the copy of any complete volume could be come at were there persons in his house capable of being corrupted to attempt so vile a robbery  what then must be his surprise when intelligence was sent him from dublin that copies of a considerable part of his work had been obtained by three different persons in that city and that the sheets were actually in the press the honest men published their own names in three different titlepages stuck up in dublin in the following words   dublin aug        speedily will be published the history of sir charles grandison in a series of letters published from the originals by the editor of pamela and clarissa in seven volumes dublin printed by and for henry saunders at the corner of christchurchlane  the second   aug  th      in the press the history of sir charles grandison as in the other  dublin printed by john exshaw on corkhill  the third   dublin aug  th      in the press and speedily will be published the history of sir charles grandison as in the two others  london printed for s richardson vile artifice  dublin reprinted for peter wilson in damestreet  the editor had convincing proofs given him that one of these men had procured a copy of a considerable part of the work in octavo another in duodecimo and that they were proceeding to print it at several presses  terms having been agreed upon between mr faulkner and the editor in consideration of the preference to be given him one of which related to the time of publishing the dublin edition that it might not interfere with the appearance of the london one mr faulkner in consequence of the successful corruption signified to the editor that it was needless to send him any more than the    sheets he had sent him and that he had obtained a fourth share of these honorable confederates but that to procure this grace as is supposed he had been compelled as he calls it to deliver up to them to print by the copy of the    sheets aforesaid which had some few corrections in them which occurred on a last revisal but which are of no moment with regard to the history though possibly this worthy confederacy may make use of those few corrections in those    sheets in order to recommend their surreptitious edition as preferable to that of the proprietor of what will not men be capable who can corrupt the servants of another man to betray and rob their master  the editor who had also great reason to complain of the treatment he met with in his pamela on both sides the water cannot but observe that never was work more the property of any man than this is his the copy never was in any other hand he borrows not from any author the paper the printing entirely at his own expense to a very large amount returns of which he cannot see in several months yet not troubling any of his friends to lessen his risque by a subscription the work copies of which have been so immorally obtained is a moral work he has never hurt any man nor offended these they would have had benefits from the sale which the editor could not have being not a bookseller and he always making full and handsome allowances to booksellers  but nothing less it seems would content these men than an attempt to possess themselves of his whole property without notice leave condition or offer at condition and they are hastening the work at several presses possibly with a view to publish their piratical edition before the lawful proprietor can publish his and who can say that if they can get it out before him they will not advertise that his is a piracy upon theirs  yet these men know that they have obtained the parts of the work they are possessed of at the price of making an innocent man unsafe in his own house and of dishonouring him in the opinion of his employers who probably may not choose to trust their property in the hands of a man who cannot secure his own from intestine traitors  since the above was written mr richardson has been acquainted that his work is now printing at four several printinghouses in dublin for the benefit of the confederacy viz two volumes at mrs reileys one at mr williamsons one at mr powells one at mr mcullochs and that they hope at mrs reileys to get another volume to print and are driving on to finish their two volumes for that purpose  the work will make seven volumes in twelves six in octavo and he apprehends from the quantity he himself had printed when the fraud was discovered that the confederacy have got possession of five entire volumes the greatest part of the sixth and of several sheets of the seventh and last but the work being stopped when the wickedness was known they cannot have the better half of the concluding volume  he is further assured that these worthy men are in treaty with booksellers in scotland for their printing his work in that part of the united kingdom from copies that they are to furnish and also that they purpose to send a copy to france to be translated there before publication no doubt for pecuniary considerations and in order to propagate to the utmost the injury done to one who never did any to them and who till this proceeding he blesses god knew not that there were such men in the world among those who could look out in broad and open day  it has been customary for the irish booksellers to make a scramble among themselves who should first entitle himself to the reprinting of a new english book and happy was he who could get his agents in england to send him a copy of a supposed saleable piece as soon as it was printed and ready to be published this kind of property was never contested with them by authors in england and it was agreed among themselves  i e among the irish booksellers and printers to be a sufficient title though nowandthen a shark was found who preyed on his own kind as the newspapers of dublin have testified but the present case will show to what a height of baseness such an undisputed license is arrived  after all if there is no law to right the editor and sole proprietor of this new work new in every sense of the word he must acquiesce but with this hope that from so flagrant an attempt a law may one day be thought necessary in order to secure to authors the benefit of their own labors nor does he wish that even these invaders of his property in ireland may be excluded from the benefit of it in the property of any of the works to which they are or shall be fairly and lawfully entitled at present the english writers may be said from the attempts and practices of the irish booksellers and printers to live in an age of liberty but not of property  n b this is not a contention between booksellers of england and ireland and on a doubtful property but between a lawful proprietor of a new and moral work  and  let messieurs wilson exshaw and saunders reflecting upon the steps they have taken and making the case their own for they no doubt have servants  fill up the blank  case of samuel richardson of london printer with regard to the invasion of his property in the history of sir charles grandison before publication  by certain booksellers in dublin
