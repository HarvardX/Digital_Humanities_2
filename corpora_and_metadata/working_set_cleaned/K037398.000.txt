five pastoral eclogues the scenes of which are supposed to lie among the shepherds oppressed by the war in germany  impius hoec tam culta novalia miles habebit barbaras has segetes en quo discordia cives perduxit miseros en queis consevimus agros virgil london printed for r dodsley at tullys head in pall mall mdccxlv price one shilling  preface it is generally thought that as pastorals are a kind of poetry which has been touched upon by such a number of poets that they are easily composed and that their thoughts and sentiments must be trite and vulgar however this opinion may be true in reason i hope the following pieces will be exempt from it is censure as they are formed on a plan entirely new and as their design is essentially distinguished from any productions of their kind either ancient or modern unless it be that the first and ninth bucolic of virgil are in the same nature how the ideas of fields and woods and a poetry whose very essence is a rural life will agree with the polite taste of the town and of gentlemen who are more conversant in the fashionable ornaments of life is a question but i hope as they relate to that war which is at present the most general topic of conversation this unpoliteness will in some measure be excused  the learned reader will observe that the author has endeavored to imitate the simplicity of the ancients in these pieces as thinking it not only more particularly adapted to pastoral but the true ornament of all kinds of poetry in general as to the design of this work i hope it will not be thought odd or illchosen the opposing interests of a peaceful and rural life and the tumultuous scenes of war together with the various struggles and passions arising from thence seem by no means an improper field for the most elegant writer to exercise his genius in how far the author of these pieces has succeeded in the performance of this is humbly submitted to the censure and judgment of the public  eclogue the first lycas and alphon alph arise my lycas in yon woody wilds from a rough rock in deep enclosure hid of thickest oaks a gushing fountain falls and pours it is airy stream with torrent pure which late returning from the field at eve i found invited by it is dashing sound as through the gloom it struck my passing ear thither i mean to drive our languid flocks fit place to cool their thirst in midday hour due west it rifes from that blasted beech the way but short  come lycas rouse thy dog let us be gone  lyc alas my friend of flock of spring or shepherds lore to me is vain to tell my favorite lamb the solace dear of these gray locks my sweet and sole delight is snatched by cruel fate an armed band on neighing steeds elate in wide array trampled the youngling as the vale along at eve they passed beneath their whelming march  alph such throng i heard as in the neighboring wood i wandered to reduce a straggling ewe escaped the fold what time the griesly owl her shrieks began and at the wonted elm the cows awaiting stood lucillas hand when strait with sudden fear alarmed i start and listening to the distantechoing steps of unseen horsemen with attentive ear i stand aloof but why this deepfelt grief merits such loss these tears and black despair  lyc alphon no more to lycas now remains since he my last and latest care is lost thou know my little flock three tender ewes were all my mean ambition wished or sought even now nine days and nine revolving nights are past since these the moldaws raging flood swept with their wattled cotes as over it is banks it rose redundant swollen with beating rains and deep immersed beneath it is whirling wave i waked at early dawn and to the field i issusd to pursue my wonted toil when lo nor flocks nor wattled cotes i saw but all that met my wondering eyes around was desolation sad here stateliest oaks torn from their roots with broken branches lay in hideous ruin there the fields that laughed with ripening corn of all their charms despoiled with oozy fragments scattered waste and wild were seen i cursed the wicked spirit drear that in the ruined abbeys darkest cell that stands immured amid yon lonesome pines i bound with triple chains his magic power ofttimes with howling storms and thunder loud deforms the night and blackens natures face his tempests swelled the moldaws rising streams and thus overwhelmed my flock  but this my heart had learned to bear at length to comforts voice it had obeyed and all it is woes forgot when ah too soon returning woes invade my breast just rising from its former stroke when this the sole survivor of my flock follows his lost companions while a wretch i here remain deserted and forlorn he too had died beneath the whelming surge had not the shelter of my lowrooft cott that fatal night preserved him where at eve i haply placed him with providing care lest the fell storm which yet from southern clouds threatened destruction and to lower began might violate his tenderblooming age  alph with piteous eye and sympathizing heart thy tears i view  these scenes of war and blood the calm repose of every field invade myself had fallen a victim to their rage as in deep dead of night my cave beneath i lay dissolved in sleep with warning voice had not my dog alarmed with wondering ear when strait approached the cave a savage throng with barbarous arms and habit fierce and wild with stern demeanor and defying look terrify which the moons paleglimmring rays presented to my sight as in the boughs close shrouded of a neighboring pine i sat where sudden fear had driven me to evade impending fate unconscious and amazed secure but trembling and in chilly damps my limbs bedewed  the monsters as they past with dire confusion all the cavern filled hurled to the ground my scrip and beechen cup dispersed the shaggy skins that form my bed and over the trampled floor had scattered wide a hoard of choicest chestnuts which i culled with nicediscerning care and had designed a present to my beauteous rosalinde alas with them her love had been obtained and me to myron she had then preferred  lyc shepherd on thee has fortune kindly smiled it is mine to feel her griefinflicting hand alas each object that i view around recalls my perished darling to my sight and mocks me with his loss see there the spring where often he wont to flake his eager thirst and there the beech beneath whose breezy shade he loved to lie close covert from the sun see yet the bark smoothworn and bare remains where often the youngling rubbed his tender side ah what availed my care and foresight vain that day he fell oppressed by whelming steeds this hand had built a bower of thickest boughs composed and wove with intermingling leaves impervious to the sun and strewn the floor with choicest hay that in the secret shade he might repose nor feel the dogstars beam but why this sad repeated track of woe i still pursue farewell my alphon dear to distant fields and pastures will i go where impious war and discord nurse of blood shall never profane the silence of the groves  eclogue the second acis and alcyon acis while in the bosom of this deep recess the voice of war has lost its madding shouts let us improve the transient hour of peace and calm our troubled minds with mutual songs while this recess conspiring with the muse invites to peaceful thoughts this cavern deep and these tall pines that nodding from the rock wave over its mouth their umbrage black and cast a venerable gloom with this clear fount that cleaves the riven stone and fills the cave with hollowtinkling sounds repeat the song which late alcyon from thy mouth i heard as to the spring we drove our thirsting flocks it tells the charms of grateful evening mild begin alcyon acis in return shall sing the praises of the dawning morn  alcy behind the hills when sinks the western sun and falling dews breath fragrance through the air refreshing every field with coolness mild then let me walk the twilight meadows green or breezy uplands near thickbranching elms while the still landschape sooths my soul to rest and every care subsides to calmest peace the mists slowrising from the rivers dank the woods scarce stirring at the whispering wind the streaky clouds that tinge their darkened tops with russet hues and fainter gleams of light the solitude that all around becalms the peaceful air conspire to wrap my soul in musings mild and naught the solemn scene and the still silence breaks but distant sounds of bleating flocks that to their destined fold the shepherd drives meantime the shrilltund bell of some lone ewe that wanders from the rest tinkles faroff with solitary sound the lowing cows that wait the milkers hand the cottagemastiffs bark the joyous shouts of swains that meet to wrestle on the green are heard around but ah since ruthless war has ravaged in these fields so tranquil once too often alas the din of clashing arms and discord fell disturbs the softer scene thy sweet approach delights the wearied ox while in loose traces from the furrowed field he comes thy dawn the weary reaper loves who long had fainted in the midday sun pleased with the cooler hour along the vale whistling he home returns to kiss his babes with joyful heart his labors sweet reward but ah what sudden fears amaze his soul when near approaching all before he sees his lowly cottage and the village round swept into ruin by the hand of war dispersed his children and his muchloved wife no more to glad his breast with home feltjoys i too when in my watled cotes are laid my supping flock rejoice to meet my dear my fair lauretta at the wonted oak or happily as her milkingpail she bears returning from the field to ease her arm sweet office and impart my aiding hand thy charms o beauteous evening shall be sung as long as these tall pines shall wave their heads or this clear fountain cleave the riven stone  acis sweet are the dews of eve her fragrance sweet sweet are the pinetopt hills at sultry noon sweet is the shelter of the friendly grott to sheep and shepherd at impending storms but ah less sweet the fragrant dews of eve less sweet the pinetopt hills at sultry noon less sweet the shelter of the friendly grott than when the rising sun with rosy beam peeps over the villagetop and over the fields the woods the hills the streams and level meads scatters bright splendors and diffusive joy as to his flock the shepherd issues forth printing new footsteps in the dewy vale each object of the joyous scene around vernal delight inspires and glads his heart unknowing of the cause with newfelt glee the chaunt of early birds on every bush the steaming odours of the freshblown flowers   alc cease acis cease thy song  from yonder hill whose lofty sides enclose this secret seat our flocks that graze along its verdrous brow tumultuous rush as struck with sudden fright and hark methinks i hear the deathful sounds of war approaching and its thunders roar  acis kind heaven preserve my wife and children dear alas i fear the sound that louder now swells in the wind and comes with fuller din is near my cottage which thou know my friend stands at the spring that issues from beneath that rising hill fast by the branching elm  alc see see my friend what darksome spires arise of wreathing smoke and blacken all the sky  nearer and nearer comes the threatening voice and more distinguished strikes our trembling ear but lo the foes advance above the hill i see their glittering arms begin to gleam come let us fly and in the deepest nook the inmost cavern of this winding grott closeshroud ourselves lest in the general stream of thousands thronging down we fall oppressed  eclogue the third when sable midnight on the fields and woods had spread her mantle dark then wandered forth the pensive alcon and the bosom deep of a wild wood with solitary steps there to lament his wretched fate he sought him late as over the vale at coming eve joyful he walked with his lucilla dear a soldier sternadvancing on his steed robbed of his love and tore the beauteous maid with brutal hand from his contending arms weeping in vain and shrieking for his aid and frowning bore the precious prize away the wood whose shades the plaintive shepherd sought was dark and pathless and by neighboring feet long time untrod for there in ancient days two knights of bold emprise and high renown met in fierce combat to dispute the prize of beauty bright whose valiant arm should win a virgin fair whose faremblazond charms with equal love had smote their rival breasts the knight who fell beneath the victors sword unhearsd and restless from that fatal day wanders the hated shades a spectre pale and each revolving night are heard to sound far from the inmost bower of the deep wood loud shrieks and hollow groans and rattling chains when the dark secrets of the grove he gained beneath an ancient oak his weary limbs he laid adown and thus to plain began this midnight deep to plaintive love accords this lonesone silence and these hideous shades that in this darksome hour i dare to tread and all the horrors of this fearful place will suit a wretch abandoned to despair l  but hah  what means this sudden fear that creeps in chilly sweats over all my trembling limbs  what hollowwhispring sounds are those i hear from yonder glade  do not i hear his voice does not the knight that in these shades was slain call me to come and beckon with his hand do not i see his visionary sword waved in bright circles through the murky air  does not he point his wounds  be still my fears it is vain illusion all and fantasy these fears my lovedistemperd brain suggests alas they will not bring me back my love  who now perhaps amid the thronged camp on earths cold breast reclines her weary head a helpless virgin subject to the will of each rude ravisher and distant far from her dear alcon and her native fields  ill will the hardships of inclement skies suit with her tender limbs the various toils of painful marches her unwonted ears how bear the trumpet and the sounds of war this task is hard indeed  but soon alas at will her savage lord may cast her off and leave her to succeeding scenes of woe i see my dear lucilla once my own naked and hungry tread the pensive steps of desolation doomed to wander over helpless and vagabond the friendless earth i hear her sigh for alcon and her home and ask for bread at some proud palace gate with unavailing voice this toilsome scene alas how different from the smoother paths of rural life my dear was wont to tread forth to the field to bear the milkingpail was all her wont to tread the tedded grass to tend her fathers flock beneath the oak to snatch her dinner sweet and on the green with the companions of her age to sport in vain i now expect the coming on of dewbathd eve to meet my wonted love no more i hear the woodgirt valleys ring with her blythe voice that often has blessed mine ear as in the distant shade i sat unseen no more i meet her at the wonted spring where each revolving noon she daily went to fill her pitcher with the crystal flood  if in her native fields the hand of death had snatched her from my arms i could have born the fatal shock with lessrepining heart for then i could have had one parting kiss i could have  her hearse with fairest flowers and paid the last sad office to my dear  return my sweet lucilla to my arms at thy return all nature will rejoice together will we walk the verdant vales and mingle sweet discourse with kisses sweet come i will climb for thee the knotted oak to rob the stockdove of his feathery young i will show thee where the softest cowslips spring and clustring nuts their laden branches bend together will we taste the dews of morn together seek the grotts at sultry noon together from the field at eve return  what have i said what painted scenes of bliss my vain imagination has displayed alas she is gone ah never to return farewell my pastral pipe and my dear flock farewell my faithful dog my oncelovd haunts farewell or cave or fountain or fresh shade farewell and thou my lowrooft cott farewell  here will i lie and fellest wolves that roam this savage forest shall devour my limbs unwept unburied in a place unknown eclogue the fourth mycon and philanthes myc welcome philanthes to thy native fields thrice three revolving moons are gone and past since first you parted from your fathers cott to drive to pastures far remote your flock since that alas how often has savage war disturbed our dwellings and defaced our fields  phil mycon each object that i view around speaks ruin and destruction see my friend the ancient wood whose venerable shades so often have sheltered us from noonday suns so often have echoed to the lowing herds that fed widewandering in the neighboring vales the soldiers ax has levelled with the ground and to the sun exposed its darksome bowers the distant villages and bluetopt hills the farstretchd meads appear and meet mine eyes that erst were intercepted by the grove  myc how is the wonted face of all things changed those trees by whose aspiring tops we knew the suns ascent at noon unerring mark no more are seen to tell the coming hour how naked does the winding rill appear whose banks its pendant umbrage deepimbrownd and farinvested with its arborous roof as by its side it rolled its secret streams how often alas those shadowy banks along close solitude my rosalind and i have walked in converse sweet and linked in love but tell me dear philanthes are the fields which late you left like ours by war oppressed alike in tumult and confusion wrapped  phi mycon i will tell thee wonders past belief it hapd one morn when first the dawning sun began to cheer the lightenlivend earth caught with so bright a scene i sought the fields before my wonted hour and roving wide among the vales the villages and woods wherever my fancy led or pleasure called i chanced upon a neighboring hill to stray to view the glittering prospect from its top of the broad rhine that rolled his waves beneath amid the level of extended meads when it may be supposed that in these lines the shepherd is giving an account of prince charless passing the rhine lo ever yet i gained its lofty brow the sound of dashing floods and dashing arms and neighing steeds confusive struck mine ear studious to know what tumult was at hand with step adventrous i advanced and gained with timorous care and cautious ken its top sudden a burst of brightness smote my sight from arms and all the imblazonrie of war reflected far while steeds and men and arms seemed floating wide and stretched in vast array over the broad bosom of the bigswoln flood that dashing rolled its beamy waves between the banks promiscuous swarmed with thronging troops these on the flood embarking those appeared crowding the adverse shore already past all was confusion all tumultuous din i trembled as i looked though far above and in one blaze their arms were blended bright with the broad stream while all the glistring scene the morn illumd and in one splendour clad struck at the sight i left with headlong haste the steepbrowd hill and over the extended vales the woodgirt lawns i ran nor slackd my pace till at my flock thickpanting i arrived and drove far off beneath a deeparchd cave but come my friend inform me in return since this my absence what has here fell out  myc do thou remember at the rivers side that solitary convent all behind hid by the convert of a mantling wood  one night when all was wrapped in darkness deep an armed troop on rage and rapine bent poured over the fields and ravaged all they met nor did that sacred pile escape their arms whose walls the murderous band to ruin swept and filled its caverns deep with armed throngs greedy of spoil and snatched their treasures old from their dark seats the shrieking sisters fled dispersed and naked through the fields and woods while sable night concealed their wandering steps part in my mossgrown cottage shelter sought which happily escaped their rage in secret glade immersed deep  i rose at early morn with fearful heart to view the ruined dome where all was desolation all appeared the seat of horror and devouring war the deep recesses and the gloomy nooks the vaulted isles and shrines of imagd saints the caverns worn by holy knees appeared and to the sun were opened  in musing thought i said as on the pile i bent my brow   this seat to future ages will appear  like that which stands fast by the piny rock  these silent walls with ivy shall be hung  and distant times shall view the sacred pile  unknowing how it fell with pious awe  the pilgrim here shall visit and the swain  returning from the field at twilight gray  shall shun to pass this way subdued by fear  and slant his course across the adverse vale  phi mycon thou see that cow which stands in cool amid yon rushy lake beneath the shade of willow green and ruminates at ease the watery herbage that around her floats that way my business leads i go to greet my father and my wonted cottage dear  myc come let us go my path is that way too come my philanthes and may piteous heaven indulge more happy days and calm our griefs alas i thought some trouble was at hand and long before presaged the coming storm even when the lightning one disastrous night blasted the hoary oak whose ample boughs imbowr my cottage and as on the grass at noon i slept a serpents sudden hiss broke my sweet rest  but come let us be gone the sun begins to welk in ruddy west  eclogue the fifth corin and calistan cor which way calistan whither do thou lead that lamb whom yet his mother scarce has weaned  call his mother corin as she wandering fed with this tender youngling by her side fell by a shot which from the battle came that in the neighboring fields so lately raged  cor alas what woes that fatal day involved our suffering village and the fields around but come calistan on this rising bank come let us sit and on the danger past converse secure and number all our griefs see how the flaunting woodbine shades the bank and weaves a mantling canopy above  call corin that day i chanced at earlier hour to rise and drove faroff my flock unpent to wash them in a spring that late i marked there the first motions of the deathful day i heard as listening to the trickling wave i stood attentive when like rising storms hoarse hollow murmurs from afar i heard and undistinguished sounds of distant din alarmed i stood unknowing whence it came and from the fount my flock unwashd i drove suspecting danger when as nearer yet i came advancing all was tumult loud all was tempestuous din on every side and all around the roar of war was up from rock to rock retost from wood to wood not half so loud the tumbling cataract is heard to roar that from the pineclad cliff praecipitates its waves whose distant sounds i often have listened as at twilight gray i pent my flocks within their watled cotes  cor for three revolving days nor voice of bird melodious chaunting or the bleat of sheep or lowing oxen near the fatal place were heard to sound but all was silence sad the ancient grove of elms deserted stood where long had dwelt an aged race of rooks that with their nests had crowded every branch we often have heard them at the dusk of eve in troops returning to their wellknown home in mingled clamors sounding from on high  call corin thou know the firinvested cave where late we sheltered from a gathering storm our flocks together driven beneath its shade i had appointed at sweet eventide to meet my delia homeward as she passed bearing her milkingpail alas the thoughts of that sweet congress the preceding night softened my dreams and all my senses lulled and with more joyful heart at morn i rose but ah that tumult cropped my blooming hopes and in confusion wrapped my love and me  cor that day nor in the fold my flock i pent or walked at eve the vales or on the turf beneath the wonted oak my dinner took or slept at noon amid my languid sheep reposed at ease on the green meadows bed when sable night came on for not even yet the tumult had subsided into peace even then low sounds and interrupted bursts of war we heard and cries of dying men and a confused hum of the ceasing storm all night closeshrouded in a forest thick wakeful i sat my flock around me laid and of neglected boughs i kindled up a scanty flame whose darklygleaming blaze among the enlightened trees formed hideous shapes and specter pale to my distempered mind how often i looked behind with cautious fear and trembled at each motion of the wind  but where did you calistan shelter seek what dark retreat concealed your wandering steps  call corin thou know the furclad hermits cell deeparchd beneath a rock among the wilds thither i bent my flight a welcome guest and not unknown for when my flock i fed of late beneath the neighboring pastures green i often was wont invited at his call at noon beneath his cavern to retire from the suns heat where all the passing hours the good old man improved with converse high and in my breast enkindled virtues love nor seldom would his hospitable hand afford a short repast of berries cool which over the wilds his scanty food he plucked here was my refuge  all the livelong night pensive by one pale lonesome lamp we sat and listened to the bleak winds whistling loud and the shrill crash of forests from without soon as the morning dawned the craggy height of the steep rock i climbed on whose wild top his rustic temple stood and mossgrown cross the sacred object of his pious prayers formed of a tall firs thunderblasted trunk where all beneath the expansive plains i saw with white pavilions hid in deep array there too my little fold which late i left standing at eve amid the warlike scene with tearful eyes affrighted i beheld alas how changed the scene when there i pitched those hurdled coes the night was calm and mild and all was peaceful i remember well while there within that fold my flock i pent how blythe i heard my beauteous delia sing her distantechoing voice how sweetly rung and all my ravished senses wrapped in bliss  cor have thou not seen the fatal plain of death where raged the conflict there they say at eve grim ghosts are seen of men that there were slain pointing their wounds and shrieking to their mates still doomed to haunt the fields on which they fell  call corin no more this lamb demands my speed see how the youngling hangs his sickly head tender and fainting for his wonted food i haste to place him in my sheltering cott fed from my hand and cherished by my care  and see my friend far off in darkened west a cloud comes on and threatens sudden rains corin farewell the storm begins to lower
