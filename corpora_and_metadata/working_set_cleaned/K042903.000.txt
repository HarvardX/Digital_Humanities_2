a review of doctor johnsons new edition of shakespeare in which the ignorance or inattention of that editor is exposed and the poet defended from the persecution of his commentators  by w kenrick  london printed for j pain at the feathers in paternoster row  m dcc lxv  preface every act says goodman delver has three branches it is to act to do and to perform hamlet   contemptible as this piece of casuistry may be deemed certain it is that our honest gravedigger was not mistaken in the number of those distinctions which are necessary to the investigation of moral merit he was not so happy indeed in his specification of the parts to be distinguished his logic however may pass if we conceive the first part of his division to comprehend the design or intent of the act the second the manner of putting it in execution and the third the effects or consequences produced by it  thus in apologizing for the present review there are three things to be considered   the design or intent of writing it   the manner in which it is written and lastly the probable effects or consequences that will ensue  in respect to the former the reviewer begs leave to express his motives for writing in the words of an ingenious author who stood exactly in the same predicament i thought it a piece of justice due to the memory of shakespeare to the reputation of letters in general and of our english language in particular to take some public notice of a performance which i am sorry to say has violated all these respects had this been done by a common hand i had held my peace and left the work to that oblivion which it deserves but when it came out under the sanction of a great name that of a gentleman who had by other writings how justly i shall not  now examine obtained a great reputation for learning it became an affair of some consequence as chimerical conjectures and gross mistakes might by these means be propagated for truth among the ignorant and unwary and that be established for the genuine text nay the genuine text amended too which is neither shakespeares nor english see appendix to the canons of criticism   such being the motives of action the intent and design of the act is plainly what is set forth in the title viz to defend the text of shakespeare from the persecution of his commentators  the reviewer is well aware that dr johnsons selfsufficiency may suggest a more sinister view for he doubts not that gentleman thinks of himself what he has said of dr warburton that he has a name sufficient to confer celebrity on those who can exalt themselves into antagonists and hence he may possibly impute the present work to the motive which he insinuates to have actuated the opponents of that writer the allusion also of the eagle and owl which he quotes from macbeth may with a very little latitude of construction be applied as well to himself and the reviewer as to dr warburton and his antagonist  an eagle towering in his pride of place  was by a mousing owl hawkd at and killed see dr johnsons preface to his edition of shakespeare  for though dr johnson having neither preferment in the church nor post in the state the word place may seem to want that strict propriety the critics require yet if we reflect how nearly places and pensions are allied there is not one of shakespeares commentators who would make any scruple of substituting one word for the other reciprocally and alternately as he thought the case might require there is no doubt also that on this occasion the word pension would be preferred as a pension must be universally allowed caeteris paribus to be better than a place to a man so fond of doing but little as it is apprehended the reader will think is the case with dr johnson  to invalidate however the force of such a suggestion the reviewer is reduced to the necessity of apparently boasting that in this respect he does not lie under the disadvantage of being exactly in the same situation with the author of the canons of criticism who frankly confesses that it was the first as it was the only book he wrote in his life dr johnson indeed may in all probability have never before heard the name of the present writer he has nevertheless some little literary reputation to lose which he would not unadvisedly or wantonly put to the hazard  this longexpected edition of shakespeare is not the first work by many that he has reviewed nor is this review the only book he has written for though the name of dr johnson is much better known than the merit of his writings his reviewer on the contrary has hitherto chosen rather to have the merit of his writings known than his name the publication of the one is of consequence to the world that of the other of none but to the writer with whose personal importance or insignificance the public have nothing to do in confirmation of what is here asserted it may possibly be thought necessary to name some of those publications on which the public have conferred the honor of a favorable reception  it is presumed needless however to particularize performances that would certainly have been less faulty had they been less numerous the author contents himself therefore with mentioning only his epistles to lorenzo and the translations of rousseaus eloisa and emilius     with regard to the second division of our prefatory sermon respecting the manner in which this review is written the author can readily foresee that he shall be thought to have treated both dr johnson and dr warburton with an illbecoming levity if not with unmerited severity at least this he conceives will be the opinion of those whom an innate consciousness of their own weakness inspires with a timidity which they miscall and flatter themselves to be candor the reviewer confesses indeed he should have been glad to have had on this occasion less to do with the commentary of the reverend gentleman last mentioned and this he has reason to think would have been the case had not dr johnson been prevailed on by his printer prudentially to cancel several annotations in which he had strongly expressed his dissent from that learned scholiast but having on second thoughts judged it expedient to shelter himself as it were under the wing of the bishop of gloucester it is hoped the justice due to shakespeare will excuse the reviewer though he should be sometimes obliged in correcting his present editor to ruffle and expose an irreverend feather or two of the bishops  that he may not be suspected however of attempting to injure either from a principle of spleen or resentment he can safely aver with regard to both what another of dr warburtons antagonists has declared in respect to him alone i e that he is personally a stranger to either of these gentlemen never conversed with them never saw them  but once never had the least communication with them of any kind never has received or solicited any favor from either nor on the other hand has been ever personally disobliged by them so that it is impossible this proceeding can have been influenced either by disappointment or resentment the truth is that the reviewer has always understood it to be an established law in the republic of letters wisely calculated to restrain the excesses of insult petulance and ill nature too apt to shoot up in the splenetic recesses of solitary literature that every writer should be treated on the same foot of civility on which when unprovoked by prior ill usage he has been accustomed to treat others see the preface to the revisal of shakespeares text  now whether he he has treated either of these gentlemen worse than they have treated shakespeare he dares appeal to the impartiality of the public which at whatever low estimation it may rate an obscure author who has never set his name to a book it will hardly think there can be a greater difference between him and this par nobile fratrum of commentators than there is between them and the inimitable writer on whose works they have so freely commented if the reviewer has at any time indeed behaved toward these gentlemen with little ceremony it has been always when they deserved much less for it is to be observed he had nothing to do with the political characters of either he did not think it necessary therefore to pay any deference to dr johnson as his majestys pensioner nor to dr warburton as bishop of gloucester their literary character was all that concerned him and even viewing them in this light he had to respect them only as commentators on shakespeare   not that the reviewer piques himself on being deficient in point of civility or would take upon himself to infringe the necessary forms of decency and decorum he admits as dr johnson observes that respect is due to high place and tenderness for living reputation but then he conceives that respect to be limited both as to place and time and cannot admit that any tenderness for the living gives us a right to trample inhumanly and sacrilegiously on the dead  had the bishop of gloucester when he entered on that rightreverend function made a public recantation of the errors of poetry and formally renounced the pomps and vanities of verbal criticism not one of the heresies he maintained or the sins he committed in this kind absurd and enormous as they were should with the reviewers consent have risen up in judgment against him or have been dragged from that oblivion to which they seemed eternally consigned but if either dr warburton or his friends presume on the influence of lawnsleeves in the republic of letters it is proper to inform them there are neither bishops priests nor deacons in that community the republic of letters is a perfect democracy where all being equal there is no respect of persons but every one has a right to speak the truth of another to censure without fear and to commend without favor or affection nor is the literary community of less dignity than the political popularity and influence indeed may be obtained for a while by sinister means in both but though birth and wealth may confer eminence and power in the one not the descent of an alexander nor the riches of croesus confer prerogative or authority in the other  in the primitive state of society a superiority of intellectual abilities was the foundation of all civil preeminence and hence the scepter continued to be swayed by superior wisdom through a succession of ages the acquisitions of science and learning were held among the ancients in no less esteem than those of conquest and in as much greater than the possessions of royalty as a chaplet of laurel was preferred to a coronet of mere gems and gold xenophon reaped more honor from his cyropaedia than from the famous retreat of the ten thousand and caesar still more from his commentary than from all the military exploits recorded in it as to the examples of modern times to say nothing of james and christina lest it be objected that one was a weak man and the other a foolish woman we have seen the kings of prussia and of poland the alexander and the nestor of our age ambitious to become authors and be made denizons of our little state frederick has been more than once heard to say he would give his crown and stanislaus if he had not lost it would have given another to possess the scientific fame of leibnitz or the literary reputation of voltaire  is it by the way then to be wondered at that a private individual like samuel johnson should be even preposterously elated at finding that homage paid to him which has been in vain solicited by sovereigns and is refused even to the king on his throne graduated by universities pensioned by his prince and surrounded by pedagogues and poetasters he finds a grateful odor in the incense of adulation while admiring booksellers stand at a distance and look up to him with awful reverence bowing the knee to baal and holding in fearful remembrance the exemplary fate of tom osborne presumptuous tom osborne who braving the vengeance of this papercrowned idol was for his temerity transfixed to his motherearth by a thundering folio it may be a pity to disturb dr johnson from so pleasing a reverie and to dissipate so agreeable a scene of delusion he will exclaim doubtless with the honest citizen of argos pol me occidistis   cui sic extorta voluptas et demptus per vim mentis gratissimus error but if the interests of our literary state require it it cannot be doubted that the mere gratification of an individual ought to be given up for the good of the whole community  but to proceed to the third and last head of our discourse the object of which is the effects or consequences of the following review these like the subject of our preface may be divided also into three parts in the first place it is presumed the injuries done to the name of shakespeare will be in a great measure repaired and the luster of his tarnished honor restored in the second it is feared dr johnson will suffer not a little in his literary reputation and in the last it may be suspected that the proprietors will be injured in the sale of the work  in regard to the first the pleasure which it is presumed every true englishman will feel at the attempt to do justice to his favorite poet will sufficiently exculpate the author had it been necessary to practice a still greater severity in effecting it  with respect to the second it may not be improper for the writer to offer something in his justification it is not easy to guess how far dr johnson would have the respect due to living reputation extend when applied to himself he may possibly have adopted the opinion of wolfius and will plead the authority of that great civilian to prove that men of letters ought not to detract from the unmerited reputation of others nemo eruditorum alterius famae ac laudi sive meritae sive immeritae detrahere debet in reply to this however mr de vattel a civilian of equal authority though perhaps of somewhat less note takes a different side of the question affirming that no person has a just complaint because we may deprive him of a thing to which he has no right and which he unjustly assumes to himself on the other hand he determines that the literary reputation which is gotten undeservedly is injurious to men of true merit who thus become sufferers by the vain and undeserving when praise continues this able civilian is prostituted on unworthy objects it loses its value the world grows distrustful and in consequence of being made the dupe of pretenders frequently refuses to bestow its applause on the truly meritorious ought we to contribute to this injustice for fear of depriving an impostor of the reputation on which he plumes himself and to which he has no wellfounded pretensions surely not such is the reasoning of de vattel on this interesting point how far it is applicable to any or all the editors of shakespeare the public is to determine it is sufficient that the reviewer has the civil law at least on his side in his endeavors to do justice to merit though he should be found to have detracted more in effect than with design from the reputation of the undeserving his conscience is perfectly easy also from the reflection that if he had not undertaken to expose the defects of dr johnsons work somebody else would for as mr edwards justly observes the world will not long be imposed on by ungrounded pretenses to learning or any other qualification nor does the knowledge of words alone if it be really attained make a man learned every true judge as he observes will subscribe to scaligers opinion if says that great critic a persons learning is to be judged of by his reading no body can deny eusebius the character of a learned man but if he is to be esteemed learned who has shown judgment together with his reading eusebius is not such to this it may be truly added in the words of another author from whom this writer also borrowed them as he used them on a similar occasion it is not the purpose of the following remarks to cast a blemish on his dr johnsons envied fame but to do a piece of justice to the real merit of the comment and the commentator by that best and gentlest method of correction which nature has ordained in such a case of laughing them down to their proper rank and character  as to the last point viz the interest of the proprietors the reviewer thinks it very problematical whether this will be affected either way he has indeed known books sometimes sell the better for being publicly censured but be this as it may he can truly aver that he meant them no harm for though it is possible that one or other of them may have sometimes failed a little in that respect to the writer which he thinks an author has a right to expect of his bookseller and his bookseller if he is wise will be ready to pay him yet he does not harbor so much resentment against any of them as to wish to hurt their interest if unluckily it should turn out however that the sale of dr johnsons edition of shakespeare should be hence obstructed and that it should only hobble instead of taking a run the proprietors have nothing to do but to engage the reviewer if they can or some body else to furnish them with a better edition nor will this be a difficult task although it would be an arduous and noble one to give the public such a commentary as the writings of this incomparable bard deserve  to detain the reader but a moment longer  dr johnson having acted in the outrage he has committed on shakespeare just like other sinners not only by doing those things he ought not to have done but by leaving undone those things he ought to have done his sins of omission are not less important though much more numerous than those of commission indeed nothing is more usual with commentators in general than to display their own sagacity on obvious passages and to leave the difficult ones to be explained by the sagacity of their readers dr johnson indeed says in his preface not a single passage in the whole work has appeared to me corrupt which i have not attempted to restore or obscure which i have not endeavored to illustrate how he has succeeded in these attempts the reader is left to judge for himself on perusal of the following sheets    the reviewer however cannot be supposed here to have given a complete commentary himself indeed he has been able only to include in the following sheets some few remarks on the most glaring blunders and defects that occur in this new edition of which such wonderful things were promised and expected and to which having seen the prophecy fulfilled we may apply with as much justice as ever it was applied to any thing that wellknown quotation from horace  quid dignum tanto feret hic promissor hiatu parturiunt montes nascetur ridiculus mus a review of doctor johnsons new edition of shakespeare the first specimen of critical sagacity which merits attention in this new edition of shakespeare occurs in the play of  the tempest vol i page   pros to mir i have with such provision in mine art so safely ordered that there is no soul no not so much perdition as an hair betid to any creature in the vessel etc  this passage has raised much contention among the commentators though it is authorized it seems by the old editions dr johnson however says it is apparently defective mr row continues he and dr warburton read that there is no soul lost without any notice of the variation mr theobald substitutes no foil and mr pope follows him to come so near the right and yet to miss it is unlucky the author probably wrote no soil no stain no spot for so ariel tells not a hair perished on their sustaining garments not a blemish but fresher than before and gonzalo  the rarity of it is that our garments being drenched in the sea keep notwithstanding their freshness and glosses of this emendation i find that the author of notes on the tempest had a glimpse but could not keep it  mr theobald is treated with no little severity in the preface of the present editor for pluming himself on his critical penetration in making some discoveries that have escaped others dr johnson however gives himself an air of superiority in the above note as exceptionable at least as any of theobalds as will appear on the slightest attention to the construction of the sentence this pretended emendation however plausibly supported being in fact entirely groundless  what can we understand by no soil betid to any creature in the vessel or if we can with difficulty strain out a meaning is the style at all like that of shakespeare whose attention to colloquial idiom is so close that our language is more indebted in this respect to him than to any other writer i had almost said all other writers put together  if the passage is to be altered let us at least make english of it shakespeare very probably wrote ill a word easily corrupted by the transcriber into soul  there is no ill no not so much perdition as an hair betid to any creature etc to betide is to befall to happen to to come to pass to become of and would here be very improperly used with soil for even supposing there were no impropriety in saying a soil might betide a suit of clothes no idiom will bear a soil betiding to a creature when its clothing only was meant  but what shall we say to the speeches of ariel and gonzalo that seem to favor the emendation proposed  what indeed but that they are little or nothing to the purpose the poet was evidently judicious enough to apprehend the spectator must be offended with the palpable impropriety of bringing on a parcel of people that had been just heartily soused in the sea without any apparent for that it was only the external appearance of their garments that was preserved is evident from the speeches of antonio and sebastian immediately succeeding that of gonzalo our garments says the latter are rather new died than stained with salt water on which antonio says to sebastian if but one of his pockets could speak would it not say he lies to which remark sebastian answers ay or very falsely pocket up his report thus it does not appear that the creatures the people themselves sustained no soil stain or spot on the contrary it seems by their discourse that they were all in a very pretty pickle notwithstanding their fair outside which the decency of theatrical representation rendered necessary for the poet to bestow on them   soil or spot on their clothes to prevent him therefore from being thus offended on their appearance on the stage ariel is previously made to mention this circumstance to prospero and in order to reconcile the audience to it when the persons actually appear gonzalo is artfully made to remind them of what had been effected by the ministry of ariel  there is not the least necessity for telling this to the auditors three times over or for prospero to mention this circumstance at all to miranda  prospero had before told her there was no harm done which she thinks very strange and he proceeds accordingly to explain from what cause there is no ill betid those of whose danger she was so very apprehensive and for whose safety she was so very solicitous has not every friend to the reputation of shakespeare a right to exclaim here  ill betide such commentators  vol i page   pros to mir  and thy father was duke of milan and his only heir and princess no worse issued  perhaps says our editor it should be  and thou his only heir i say perhaps not for if thou be admitted without rejecting the preceding and the measure is destroyed and the sense is perfect without making any such innovation if we dele the superfluous and which may well be spared in the third line and read with theobald a princess  and thy father was duke of milan and his heir a princess no worse issued perhaps the reader will be of my opinion that the passage loses neither sense spirit nor propriety by this restoration as dr johnson tells us in his preface that he has generally adopted theobalds notes unless confuted by subsequent annotators it is to be wished he had always given his reasons for deviating from him in the text  vol i page    the note contained in this page is so far a good one as it is necessary and proper to give the reader an idea of the system of enchantment on which the plot and machinery of the play is conducted i should therefore have passed it over as unexceptionable had it come from any other pen than that of dr johnson but as the world has been pleased very publicly to impute sentiments to him which seem incongruous with those he here professes i cannot pass it over without some little animadversion the incongruity i mean lies here the doctor i have been frequently informed very religiously believes in the existence of ghosts and apparitions although he here strongly insinuates that there never was any such thing practiced as witchcraft but if he believes the story of the witch of endor and that the ghost of samu appeared to saul as doubtless he does he must believe in  exercie of witchcraft and also in its power over departed spirits for though some divines maintain that it was the devil who appeared in the form of samuel and not the ghost of samuel himself yet as dr johnson in the note before us adopts the distinction made by king james in his demonology viz that an enchanter is one who commands the devil whereas the witch only serves him he cannot be allowed to shelter himself under the opinion of those learned theologues either dr johnson therefore must give up his faith in apparitions or retract this part of his note  but after all perhaps i may have been misinformed by the wicked wits of the times for though it be true they do avouch some corroborating circumstances and advance some plausible pretexts i think i can discover some fallacy at the bottom our editors favorite hooker it is true talks of spirits dispersed up and down in caves and dens under the earth and occasion may hence be taken to give out that the visit dr johnson once made to a certain cemetery was to confer with some of these spirits but in this these superficial witlings must certainly be mistaken the spirits mentioned by hooker were supposed as is here observed to be fallen angels hence though i should be brought to believe that our editor did go from cocklane to clerkenwell to fulfill an appointment with the ghost of fanny i cannot possibly suspect him of ever going there purposely to meet the devil  vol i page    ariel not a soul but felt a fever of the mad and played some tricks of desperation  in all the later editions this is changed to a fever of the mind without reason or authority nor is any notice given of an alteration  i wish our editor had given his reason for restoring the former reading against the authority of all the later editions he will say perhaps they are of no authority as theobald did of the editions of row and pope but reason and authority seem in this case to be so much at variance that i am apprehensive our editor will go near to be thought authoritymad at least by many for making this restoration without assigning the motive for it madness has been with propriety called a fever of the mind by writers of all ages and countries and it is at best a pleonasm or a piece of tautology for ariel to say they played tricks of desperation after he had said they were seized with madness perhaps our editor might think there was an impropriety in saying that a soul felt a fever of the mind but not to stand upon the philosophical distinction that might justly be made between the mind and the soul he cannot be ignorant that the word soul is here used in the vulgar and popular sense as a man a person will he persist in thinking it a sufficient reason for abiding by the old copies that the transcribers and compositors could read the same plea might be argued for perpetuating a number of blunders committed in the present edition admitting also after all that the oldest copies are likely to be most authentic and that such reading if erroneous could not thus pass through successive editions yet i will undertake in behalf of shakespeare to affirm that he did not write the above sentence as it now stands in the text the commentators on shakespeare are all very liberal in their declarations against the ungrammaticalness of his style now i will not here contend whether he always wrote grammatically or not but this i will maintain that he always wrote idiomatically if he did not always write grammar he always wrote english i wish i could say as much for the newfangled accenttuners of the present age who with their quaint and affected pretensions to refinement and elegance have so vilely corrupted the idiom of our tongue whosoever would recover and ground themselves in this must study shakespeare who though he might possibly write not a soul but felt the fever of the mad that is such a fever as the mad or as madmen feel i will be bold to say could never in this place write not a soul but felt a fever of the mad for if this means any thing it must mean they caught a fever by feeling or being in contact with madmen dr johnson must therefore retouch this restoration if he means to do justice to the text of shakespeare  vol i page    mir the strangeness of your story put heaviness in me  the strangeness why should a wonderful story produce sleep i believe experience will prove that any violent agitation of the mind easily subsides in slumber especially when as in prosperos relation the last images are pleasing  in answer to the odd question proposed at the beginning of this note i have only to say as the editor so frequently does when he meets with difficulties i know nothing of the matter i have for such a why no wherefore nay i know not that a wonderful story does produce sleep unless it follows from a profound observation which possibly our editor may have made that old women and children generally amuse themselves with relating wonderful stories just as they are going to bed the editor believes experience will prove that any violent agitation of the mind easily subsides in slumber now if he does not mean simply by this that when people are drowsy they cannot be violently agitated i do believe on the contrary experience will prove that no violent agitation of the mind easily subsides at all i have indeed heard of somebodys being so desperately in love as to fall into a profound lethargy but i believe this too was only on the authority of some playbook and much such another philosopher as miranda but supposing the fact to be true what does the editor mean by asking so strange a question or what does he intend by his reply to it does he mean for the credit of the poet to account for mirandas sleepiness from natural causes shakespeare is doubtless much obliged to him but in this our editor seems rather too officious as the poet has taken care to inform us that prospero had caused it by the power of enchantment a circumstance i wonder the editor should so soon forget when he had complimented dr warburton but two or three page    pages before on his sagacity in discovering that prosperos artmagic had in this case operated on her like a dose of liquid laudanum and that he had wisely set it to work just as he was going to tell her the most interesting story she ever heard in her life  vol i page    mir why speaks my father so urgently  urgently for ungently this is probably an error of the press as notwithstanding the instance above given of our editors foisting in a thou against all propriety of measure i think neither the emendation of sense if any is aimed at nor even the authority of copies can justify the breach of measure here and indeed though it should be the mistake of the printer an editor who is employed in literal and verbal criticism is inexcusable for not cancelling the page wherein such errors occur yet these mistakes seem very frequently to happen in the present edition thus in page   gonzalo is made to say he will be hanged yet though every drop of water swear against it and gap at widst to glut him all the other editions that i have seen read gape but perhaps our editor had some objection to a drop of waters gaping but surely it might gape and even swallow as well as swear or perhaps he thought every single drop could never gape wide enough to take down a manofwars boatswain and therefore chose to read it quaintly gap meaning that the drops separated from each other and thereby made a gap for him in the sea by every drop however shakespeare meant all the drops or the water collectively after all it is not unlikely as our editor has no note on this word that he did not think at all about it but left the text to the mercy of the printer  poor shakespeare  again in this very play page    than is printed for that and in many other places both in the text and in the notes these errors occur to the great injury of the sense so that one might be apt to think this edition as dr johnson affirms of the old ones was at last printed without correction of the press it may be very true as he also observes that before the editors art was applied to modern languages our ancestors were accustomed to so much negligence of english printers i should refer my readers to the page of the preface from whence this passage is cited but behold such is the accuracy of modern british printers the preface is not paged at all  that they could very patiently endure it but is it not reasonably to be expected dr johnson that since the editors art has been so very successfully applied to modern languages our printers should be a little more careful in correcting the press or that the editor himself should a little attend to this matter  vol i page    seb  milan and naples have more widows in them of this business making then we bring men to comfort them  it does not clearly appear whether the king and these lords thought the ship lost this passage seems to imply that they were themselves confident of returning but imagined part of the fleet destroyed why indeed should sebastian plot against his brother in the following scene unless he knew how to find the kingdom which he was to inherit  this note serves to very little purpose in illustrating the author it is a matter of no consequence to the spectator whether the king and his lords thought the ship lost or not they knew they must be somewhere in the mediterranean they were neither in the atlantic ocean nor the south sea and could not be cast ashore on greenland nor on terra australis incognita and as they found the island pleasant and temperate and affording every thing advantageous to life it was no wonder if they did not at all despair of subsisting there till they should find means to get back to naples even if their own vessel and all the fleet were wrecked and gone to the bottom but though this annotation does not serve to remove any difficulty or display any merit in the author it sufficiently serves to expose the incapacity of the annotator for commenting on shakespeare as a poet he cannot see why sebastian should plot against his brother unless he actually knew how to find the kingdom he meant to inherit but sebastians plot was natural even supposing there had been more reason for diffidence in this particular this editor might as well ask why the chiefs of the rebellious party in henry the fourth are made to quarrel about the division of the kingdom before they are masters of it and that of a kingdom of which they never are masters yet this is one of the finest scenes in all shakespeare admirably representing that anticipation of our wishes and expectations which is daily observable in men of sanguine constitutions and is inseparable from the human mind we are all too apt to count our chickens before they are hatched and even sometimes to sell them too and spend the money which occasions the hen to fit so long brooding over the eggs and produce so many addled ones at last  my annotations are no eggs  i did not say they were dr johnson but qui capit ille facit  vol i page    ant although this lord of weak remembrance        has here almost persuaded for he is a spirit of persuasion only professes to persuade the king his sons alive  for he is a spirit of persuasion etc of this entangled sentence i can draw no sense from the present reading and therefore imagine that the author gave it thus for he a spirit of persuasion only professes to persuade of which the meaning may be either that he alone who is a spirit of persuasion professes to persuade the king or that he only professes to persuade that is without being so persuaded himself he makes a show of persuading the king  dr johnson seems here to have gotten a glimpse as he before says of another commentator of the authors meaning but cannot keep it i wonder the word almost in the preceding line did not lead him quite into it there is no necessity for altering the text any farther than to transpose the comma placed after the word persuasion to the end of the line the meaning would then be this he has almost not quite persuaded the king for he is the spirit of persuasion only he professes to persuade that is he has only almost persuaded the king for he has no solid argument or weighty reason to enforce what he says he has only the mere volatile spirit of persuasion that superficial vapor of words which exhales and carries with it only the appearance the mere show or profession of persuading  or perhaps the word spirit is here used in a meaning nearly similar for the mere form apparition semblance that is not the body or substance of persuasion but be it as it will it seems that a better sense than either of dr johnsons may be drawn from this entangled sentence without the least alteration of shakespeares words for it appears evident from the opinion that both antonio and sebastian entertain of the capacity of gonzalo that the one would never call him the spirit of persuasion as having the gift of elocution it is indeed observable that notwithstanding gonzalo talks so much and is as antonio says such a spendthrift of his tongue yet francisco gives the king more substantial reasons in one single speech for thinking the prince alive than gonzalo with all his prattle  and yet alonzo is made to turn a deaf ear to him with no no he is gone    nor the other be at all influenced by any thing of which he might or might not be persuaded so that we see neither of our editors meanings are supportable but both as impertinent as the alteration of the text is unnecessary  vol i page    trin were i in england now as i once was and had but this fish painted not a holidayfool there but would give a piece of silver there would this monster make a man   that is make a mans fortune so in midsummer nights dream  we are all made men  our editor might also have added in the winters tale too act iii scene   where the clown tells the shepherd that he is a made old man i have no fault to find with this note except that i think dr johnson might have confessed his obligation to the author of the canons of criticism who gave this meaning after having exposed the absurdity of dr warburtons very learned and ridiculous note on this passage  this is not the only instance however by many as the reader will find in the perusal of these sheets wherein dr johnson adopts the opinion of that ingenious critic without mentioning either his name or his book but perhaps after treating this gentleman so scurvily as he has done in his preface he might be ashamed to have it known that his sentiments so frequently coincided with so indifferent a critic or perhaps he might think that after having knocked him fairly on the head the law of arms gave him a right to plunder him at pleasure  vol i page

about this elegant little song mr theobald reads in the first line there lurk i observing that ariel was a spirit of a refined ethereal essence and could not be intended to want food besides the sequent lines rather countenance lurk for my part i am apt to be of mr theobalds opinion for another reason and that is i think ariel though he should even be supposed to have occasion for more substantial food than the cameleon yet he cannot mean to compare himself to a be or a suckling of any kind mr theobalds reading is also more elegant and yet our editor has restored the old word suck without giving any reason for it  a more material alteration has been attempted on the last line which mr theobald in his shakespeare restored conceived should be written after sunset merrily this conjecture was countenanced by mr pope and adopted by sir thomas hanmer but dr warburton rejected it with infinite disdain dr johnson also having restored summer to the text and quoted warburtons note without any animadversion of his own must be supposed to acquiesce in the force of what that learned commentator has advanced or at least by his own confession to have nothing better to offer  and yet nothing in my opinion can be more inconclusive than the argument contained in dr warburtons annotation  it will be thought no doubt a little presumptuous in so petty an aristarchus as myself to attack conjointly two such gigantic and formidable critics but i could not with patience see a goliath treat the muse of shakespeare like a common drab at his pleasure my weapon therefore is quickly out you see for i dare draw as soon as another man if i see occasion in a good quarrel and the law of my side  dr warburtons note as it is quoted by our editor runs thus  after summer merrily this is the reading of all the editions yet mr theobald has substituted sunset because ariel talks of riding on the bat in this expedition an idle fancy that circumstance is given only to design the time of night in which fairies travel one would think the consideration of the circumstances should have set him right ariel was a spirit of great delicacy bound by the charms of prospero to a constant attendance on his occasions so that he was confined to the island winter and summer but the roughness of winter is represented by shakespeare as disagreeable to fairies and such like delicate spirits who on this account constantly follow summer was not this then the most agreeable circumstance of ariels new recovered liberty that he could now avoid winter and follow summer quite round the globe but to put the matter out of question let us consider the meaning of this line there i couch when owls do cry where in the cowslips bell and where the be sucks he tells us this must needs be in summer when when owls cry and this is in winter when blood is nipt and ways be foul then nightly sings the staring owl loves labor lost the consequence is that ariel flies after summer such is dr warburtons elaborate annotation in answer to which it may be observed that whether theobalds reasoning be right or not his own arguments are egregiously wrong i will admit with dr warburton that ariel here speaks of himself as a kind of fairy but supposing no objection to be made to the difference of climates i do not know that shakespeare has any where represented winter so excessively disagreeable to fairies as to oblige them like swallows to expatriate on the arrival of winter the argument he makes use of and the quotation he brings to put the matter out of question are insufficient and are invalidated by many other passages in shakespeare he would infer from the two lines quoted from the song in loves labor lost that owls never cry but in winter but the queen of the fairies in the midsummer nights dream says to her attendants  keep back the clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders at our quaint spirits and again puck at the latter end of the same play says now the wasted brands do glow whilst the scritchowl shrieking loud puts the wretch that lies in woe in remembrance of a shroud thus we see that the owls do cry even in the presence of the fairies it may not be amiss also to remark that in the song of winter the owl is represented as singing a merry note whereas in the other passages she is said to cry to be clamorous which it might with great propriety be said to do in summer when her hooting is contrasted to the nightwarbling bird that now awake tunes sweetest his lovelabourd song  a circumstance that does not operate to the owls disadvantage in the cold and dreary nights of winter when the same hooting may even have something cheerful in it at least to those who are sitting by a good fire in the chimneycorner while greasy joan does keel the pot as to what dr warburton says about following summer quite round the globe i never before heard that summer itself went round the globe that it vibrates from pole to pole is certain but there is some little difference between that motion of the earth which causes summer and winter and that which causes day and night  in regard to dr warburtons calling theobalds reason for altering the text an idle fancy and his telling us that the circumstance of the bat is only introduced to design the time of night in which fairies travel i must observe that ariel does not seem to be one of those kind of fairies that as puck says  run by the triple hecats team from the presence of the sun following darkness like a dream on the contrary he appears to execute the commands of prospero by daylight nor is this inconsistent with his character as a fairy of a superior kind for thus oberon the fairy king on pucks telling him of the approach of morning which hastens away those spirits that for aye consort with blackbrowd night replies but we are spirits of another sort i with the morning light have often made sport and like a forester the groves may tread even till the eastern gate all fieryred opening on neptune with fair blessed beams turns into yellow gold his salt green streams   the two gentlemen of verona this play is not numbered as dr johnson observes among the most powerful of shakespeares effusions our editor indeed conceives it was not very successful on the stage and that it has escaped corruption only because being seldom played it was less exposed to the hazards of transcription among a few other remarks of equal importance however which he thinks proper to make on this play his critical acumen has discovered a corruption of the text in launces conversation with his dog scene vi act iv lance  o it is a soul thing when a cur cannot keep himself in all companies i would have as one should say one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed to be as it were a dog at all things     on this passage our learned editor thus sagaciously remarks i believe we should read i would have etc one that takes upon him to be a dog to be a dog indeed to be etc  is not this a curious and important emendation it is however not quite ingenious enough to be true or even to deserve to be true what can dr johnson mean by a dogs taking upon him to be a dog this every cur that is whelpd is of course but he that would be a dog indeed as lance says that is one who would be thought to be possessed of all the essential good qualities of his species should be as it were a dog at all things  what cursed curs are crabbed critics and carping commentators who are ever contentious for a bone to pick yet when they have got one cannot help snarling at those who afford it them  midsummer nights dream vol i p     queen full often she has gossipt by my side and sat with me on neptunes yellow sands marking the embarked traders on the flood when we have laughed to see the sails conceive and grow bigbellied with the wanton wind which she with pretty and with swimming gate following her womb then rich with my young squire would imitate and sail upon the land to fetch me trifles and return again as from a voyage rich with merchandise  dr warburton and our editor have both attempted to illustrate this passage without success the difficulty lies in the sixth seventh and eighth lines dr warburton says following what she did not follow the ship whose motion she imitated for that sailed on the water she on the land if by following we are to understand imitating it will be a mere pleonasm  imitating would imitate from the poets description of the actions it plainly appears we should read follying  would imitate i e wantoning in sport and gaiety thus the old english writers  and they beleeven folyly and falsely  says sir j mandeville from and in the sense of folatrer to play the wanton this exactly agrees to the action described  full often has she gossipt by my side  and  when we have laughed to see  this note dr johnson tells us is very ingenious but continues he since follying is a word of which i know not any example and the fairys favorite might without much licentiousness of language be said to follow a ship that sailed in the direction of the coast i think there is no sufficient reason for adopting it the coinage of new words is a violent remedy not to be used but in the last necessity  i will not dispute with our editor the ingenuity of dr warburtons note or that of his own but it is certainly an ingenuity of a different kind to that which is necessary to illustrate shakespeare the former of these gentlemen i remember affected to ridicule the booksellers for believing a silly maxim that none but a poet should presume to meddle with a poet the event however has proved this maxim to have some truth in it if either dr warburton or dr johnson had in criticizing this passage exercised their ingenuity as poets instead of their ingenuity as philologers i am persuaded they would have soon discovered its meaning but they were too intent upon words to attend to the images designed to be conveyed by them the former talks of an action described in two lines wherein nothing is spoken of but gossipping and laughing do these imitate a ship under sail to have been merely playful and wanton is not the imitation here mentioned nor does it consist in merely following the object imitated as dr johnson conceives for she did not only sail upon land in the same direction along the coast as the ships did in the sea but she returned again which must have been in a different direction so that it appears neither of these ingenious critics had any idea of the poetical beauty of this passage  i shall endeavor to explain it therefore by a very different mode of investigation  if the reader has ever seen a ship scudding before the wind with its foresail grown bigbellied as the poet expresses it with the swelling breeze he must recollect that in such a case the sail projects so far forward that it seems to a spectator on shore to go in a manner before the rest of the vessel which for the same reason appears to follow though closely after with an easy swimming motion  this was the moving image which the fairys favorite taking the hint from and the advantage of her pregnancy endeavored to imitate and this she did by wantonly displaying before her the convexity of her swelling belly and moving after it as the poet describes  with pretty and with swimming gate such being the sense of the passage the text is easily ascertained by pointing and reading thus which she with pretty and with swimming gate following her womb then rich with my young squire would imitate this is the method a critic should take with the poets trace out their images and you will soon find how they expressed themselves without perplexing yourself either about the meaning of antiquated words or the coinage of new ones  vol i page     philist  i have heard it over and it is nothing nothing in the world unless you can find sport in their intents extremely stretched and connd with cruel pain to do you service  thus all the copies but as i know not what it is to stretch and con and intent i suspect a line to be lost  it is very common with dr johnson when his critical sagacity is at fault to suppose a chasm in the text to excuse his having lost scent of the poets meaning there is no need however for such a supposition here by intents is plainly meant the design or scheme of the piece intended for representation the conceit of which being farfetched or improbable it might be with propriety enough called extremely stretched as to this scheme or design being connd if any objection be made to the supposition of its having been written penned it is no wonder such players as these are represented to be such a crew of patches rude mechanicals should con their several parts with cruel pain   vol i page     hip i love not to see wretchedness oercharged

to take what they mistake and what poor duty cannot do noble respect takes it in might not merit  the sense of this passage the apprehended difficulty of which lies in the two last lines as it now stands if it has any sense is this what the inability of duty cannot perform regardful generosity receives as an act of ability though not of merit the contrary is rather true what dutifulness tries to perform without ability regardful generosity receives as having the merit though not the power of complete performance we should therefore read and what poor duty cannot do noble respect takes not in might but merit   that is says our editor we should read directly contrary to what the poet has written nothing however i think can be more plain or more consistent with truth than the passage as it now stands is it not a common thing for the lords and other owners of estates in many countries where the peasants are poor and cannot pay their rent in cash to take it in catile or in corn does not the parson though he sometimes takes his tithes in a modus frequently take them also in kind is not every creditor where a debt is desperate willing to take in meal or in malt what he cannot get in money and does not this mode of expression justify the speaker in saying agreeable to the idiom of our language that as to  what poor duty cannot do noble respect takes it in might not merit  that is not as an act of ability though not of merit as dr johnson says but as an act of merit though not of ability thus in consequence of its inability taking the will for the deed viz accepting the best in its might to do for the best that might be done rating the merit of the deed itself at nothing agreeable to the first line of theseuss speech the kinder we to give them thanks for nothing   vol i page     the now is the mural down between the two neighbors  them no remedy my lord when walls are so wilful to hear without warning  on this passage our editor quotes the following note from dr warburton without animadversion shakespeare could never write this nonsense we should read  to rear without warning i e it is no wonder that walls should be suddenly down when they were as suddenly up  reared without warning  had our editor nothing to offer better than this and has he so little veneration for shakespeare as so readily to countenance the charge against him of writing nonsense did you dr johnson ever read the scene wherein this passage occurs quite through i could almost venture to affirm that neither you nor dr warburton ever could have read it through with any attention it seems to me morally impossible if you had that he could have made so egregious a mistake or you have admitted it among your notes  shakespeare most undoubtedly wrote it hear as it stands in the text for not to insist upon the palpable defects of dr warburtons explanation the most undoubted evidence in justification of this reading may be deduced from the context in the preceding page the wall makes a speech on which theseus says would you desire lime and hair to speak better and demetrius answers it is the wittiest partition that ever i heard discourse on this pyramus enters and closes his speech with a curse against the wall his speech ending with the words deceiving me upon which theseus again thus remarks the wall methinks being sensible should curse again no says the actor who played pyramus in truth sir he should not deceiving me is thisbe s cue she is to enter and i am to spy her through the wall you shall see it will fall pat as i told you yonder she comes  now pyramus and thisbe having met and spied each other through the crevice for which purpose only the wall was introduced their interview is no sooner over than the actor who played the wall apparently without waiting for his cue as no body speaks to him and he speaks to no person in the drama says thus have i wall my part discharged so and being done thus wall away does go on which theseus observes again as in the passage cited now is the mural down between the two neighbors to which demetrius answers no remedy it is to be observed that demetrius does not say it is no wonder as dr warburton expresses it in his explanation but there is no remedy i cannot doubt therefore that the above is the plain and obvious meaning of this passage that the expression however may bear a reference to some latent meaning i do not deny and possibly it may refer to a custom practiced by the magistrates in many places abroad of sticking up a notice or warning on the walls of ruinated and untenanted houses for the owners either to repair or pull them quite down    my lord when walls are so wilful to hear without warning that is so wilful as to take their cue before it be given them  measure for measure vol i page     duke we have with special soul elected him our absence to supply  dr warburton says this nonsense must be corrected thus with special roll i e by a special commission the present editor dr johnson thinks warburton right in supposing a corruption but less happy in his emendation he reads therefore with special seal which he says is a very natural metonymy for a special commission  but why did not our editor obviate the objection made against this supposition of a corruption by the author of the canons of criticism was his objection of too little weight or was the writer of too little consequence to need a refutation this author remarks on this passage that with special soul may fairly be interpreted to mean with great thought upon mature deliberation but that with special roll for  by special commission is harsh and awkward and to elect a man by a commission instead of  appoint him is flat nonsense now this objection lies equally against dr johnsons reading as against dr warburtons and must be removed before i withdraw my caveat against any innovation being made in the text indeed i will oppose totis viribus the admission of dr johnsons seal lest some future commentator should start up and affirm that although to elect by or with a commission may be nonsense yet to erect by or with a commission is sense to erect here meaning nothing more than to set up to promote which is done by commission and how plausibly might not such an annotator maintain that such reading would be perfectly consistent with the context  for you must know we have with special seal erected him our absence to supply lent him our terror dressed him with our love and given his deputation all the organs of our own power might he not exclaim is it not plain that the duke means to say he has erected that is set up angelo in the place of himself besides who could refuse after having changed two letters at the instance of dr johnson to make so small a variation as one for his successor it is only he might plead changing an l for an r merely one liquid for another the transcribers and printers might easily mistake it  who does not see as dr johnson says in another place that upon such principles there is no end of correction  away therefore with all such trifling and revere the text of shakespeare  vol i page  0  isab else let my brother die if not a feodary but only he owe and succeed by weakness  this passage seems to have confounded all the commentators dr warburton makes the following curious and learned note upon it this is so obscure a passage but so fine in its application that it deserves to be explained a feodary was one that in the times of vassalage held lands of the chief lord under the tenure of paying rent and service which tenures were called feuda amongst the goths now says angelo we are all frail yes replies isabella if all mankind were not feodaries who owe what they are to this tenure of imbecility and who succeed each other by the same tenure as well as my brother i would give him up the comparing mankind lying under the weight of original sin to a feodary who owes suit and service to his lord is i think not illimagined  this note with little variation is inserted in theobalds edition who says it explains one of the most beautiful allusions imaginable  the present editor inserts this note also without any remark of his own he observes indeed that to owe means in this place to own to hold to have possession  for my part i never could reconcile the words of this passage by any mode of construction to the sense here put on it indeed it never appeared to me from the tenor of the conversation that isabel could possibly entertain such a constrained and farfetched allusion as the ingenious dr warburton has here fished out for her i conceive her meaning to be much more simple and if the reader observes the connection of this speech with those of angelo that precede and follow i doubt not but he will be of my opinion it is true that to owe means here as in other parts particularly in the tempest where prospero says to ferdinand  thou do here usurp the name thou owst not  of shakespeares writings to own to have to be possessed of or invested with the word feodary however is not derived from feuda nor has its meaning here any relation to the customs of the feudal times but is derived from foedus a covenant and is therefore misspelt it having here the same meaning as the word feodary in the following passage in cymbeline where it means an accomplice a confederate a companion equally guilty  damned paper black as the ink that is on thee senseless bauble art thou a feodarie for this act taking the words in this their true sense let us see if we cannot without forcing their construction discover a meaning more in character with the speaker and therefore more likely to be intended by shakespeare ang we are all frail  isab else let my brother die if not a feodary but only he owe and succeed by weakness  that is let my brother die if not one of his companions if only he of all his sex is frail and has succeeded in his attempts on women by taking advantage of a like frailty in them  that this is the true sense i think is put past dispute by the subsequent speech of angelo who takes occasion from the last suggestion of isabel to say nay women are frail too which is as much as if he had said nay the women as you observe are frail too  ay says isabel  as the glasses where they view themselves  women  help heaven men their creation mar in profiting by them etc that is says dr johnson in imitating them in taking them for examples but i cannot see how we can with any propriety be said to profit by what mars our creation i rather think isabel means to say that man disgraces himself by profiting or taking advantage of female weakness and this seems to agree with the context  vol i page     duke  reason thus with life if i do lose thee i do lose a thing that none but fools would keep  dr warburton in order i presume to lay hold of an occasion for altering the text excepts against this passage as being a direct persuasive to suicide the absurdity however of supposing that the speaker intended it as such is obvious since he is endeavoring to instill into a condemned prisoner a resignation to his sentence dr johnson observes that the meaning seems plainly this that none but fools would wish to keep lie or none but fools would keep it if choice were allowed a sense which whether true or not he remarks is certainly innocent but though our editor is graciously pleased to exculpate shakespeare in this particular it appears to be only that he may fall upon him with the greater violence in a page or two after where dr warburton vouchsafes to pay the poet a compliment this passage is in the same speech as the foregoing  thy best of rest is sleep and that thou often provokst yet grossly fear thy death which is no more this passage says dr warburton is evidently taken from the following of cicero habes somnum imaginem mortis eamque quotidie induis and dubitas quin sensus in morte nullus sit cum in ejus simulachro videas esse nullum sensum but the epicurean insinuation is with great judgment omitted in the imitation on this note dr johnson has made the following remark here dr warburton might have found a sentiment worthy of his animadversion i cannot without indignation find shakespeare saying that death is only sleep lengthening out his exhortation by a sentence which in the friar is impious in the reasoner is foolish and in the poet is trite and vulgar  nor can i dr johnson without equal indignation find you misrepresenting shakespeare and thence taking occasion to condemn him for what he is not culpable lengthening out your censure with imputations that being false in themselves appear as invidious in the man as they are contemptible in the critic would not one imagine from the warmth with which dr johnson speaks of this passage that it militates against the doctrine of the immortality of the soul insinuating that in death we close our eyes and sleep for ever  nothing however can be more foreign from the plain intent of the speaker and the obvious meaning of the passage the duke in the assumed character of a friar is endeavoring to persuade claudio to acquiesce in the sentence of death passed on him and to prepare himself for launching into eternity to this end he advises him to think altogether on death and to excite him to do so he enumerates the several foibles of humanity and the calamities incident to human life evidently intending by this means to wean his affections from the world and render him less averse to part with it and less apprehensive of the pain of dying thou often provokest sleep says he yet absurdly fear to die which with regard to the painful and perplexing vigil of life is only to go to sleep for that he only speaks of the mere sense of death the parting of the soul from the body and that claudio understood him so is very evident by the reply which the latter makes to his harangue notwithstanding the very last words of it seem to be full as exceptionable as those objected to duke  in this life lie hid a thousand deaths yet death we fear that makes these odds all even  clau i humbly thank you to sue to live i find i seek to die and seeking death find life let it come on  if any thing further be necessary to corroborate what is here advanced we might instance the dukes exhorting him in scene iii of the same act to go to his knees and prepare for death it is highly inconsistent to think such a piece of advice should come from one who conceived death to be a perpetual sleep prayers must seem as superfluous to him as the advice must appear impertinent to the prisoner but that claudio had the strongest notions of a future state after death is not to be doubted since speaking of the sin of debauching his sister and angelos design to commit it he says if it were damnable he being so wise why would he for the momentary trick be perdurably fined again when his fears recurring he tells his sister that death is a fearful thing it is plain he does not confine the meaning of the word as the duke did to the mere act or circumstance of dying for when she retorts upon him and shamed life a hateful he goes on ay but to die and go we know not where as if he had said i do not mean the mere pain of dying it is what is to come after death that i fear when we are to  go we know not where to lie in cold obstruction and to rot this sensible warm motion to become a kneeded clod and the delighted spirit to bathe in fiery floods or to reside in thrilling regions of thickribbed ice to be imprisoned in the viewless winds and blown with restless violence round about the pendant world or to be worse than worst of those that lawless and uncertain thoughts imagine howling it is too horrible can we think that shakespeare could so far forget himself as to be here so very explicit regarding the notion of a future state if but two or three pages before he had been inculcating a contrary doctrine  what then must we think of his commentator who affects to be moved with indignation and in effect presumes to charge him on this account with vulgarity folly and impiety shakespeare appears to have had such a regard even for his mortal part at least if he wrote the verses said to be put on his gravestone good friend for jesus sake forbear to dig the dust enclosed here blessed be the man that spares these stones and cursed be he who moves my bones     as to bestow a curse on the person who should disturb his ashes what a severe malediction then would he not have bestowed on that sacrilegious hand which has thus mangled his immortal reputation could he have penetrated the womb of time or anticipated the temerity of a modern critic i had written the above remarks and sent them to the press without recollecting that a similar reference to this imprecation of shakespeare is to be met with in the appendix to the canons of criticism last edition page   0 i leave the public to judge says that sensible critic which has been engaged against shakespeare mr warburton or i who have in part at least vindicated that best of poets from the worst of critics from one who has been guilty of a greater violation of him than that of the authors on which he imprecated vengeance in his epitaph a violation which were he not armed against the superstition of believing in portents and prodigies might make him dread the apparition of that injured bard  here we see the murder comes out dr warburton it is true was not only armed against the superstition of believing in ghosts by his principles as a philosopher but also against their doing him hurt by the awful power annexed to his sacred functions and character as a priest but this is not the case with dr johnson whose religion and philosophy put together it seems cannot secure him against the terrors of such superstition so that as i before observed here the secret comes out and we see the reason for his sitting up all night and lying abed all day for fear of apparitions  it is not so much from his fear of ghosts in general for we know he did not appear to be afraid of fanny but of the ghost of shakespeare whose fame he is conscious of having inhumanly assassinated and whose violated muse cries aloud for vengeance against him     vol i page     isab  dare thou die the sense of death is most in apprehension and the poor beetle that we tread upon in corpral sufferance finds a pang as great as when a giant dies  the poor beetle etc the reasoning is that death is no more than every being must suffer though the dread of it is pepeculiar to man or perhaps that we are inconsistent with ourselves when we so much dread that which we carelessly inflict on other creatures that feel the pain as acutely as we  the reasoning appears to be no more than is actually and obviously expressed in the text isabel is persuading her brother that the sense of death is felt more in apprehension than in reality for that in reality it is next kin to nothing the poor beetle that we tread upon and which it is to be supposed can never be susceptible of much pain feeling a pang as great as a giant ergo more than claudio will feel  this is the whole of this simple argument which serves to corroborate what has been said in the preceding note and at the same time to show that if any one in this play seems to believe in the mortality of the soul it is isabel which i think it is preposterous to imagine when we consider that she is just going into a nunnery with a design to take the veil  vol i page     claud the princely angelo  isab oh it is the cunning livery of hell the damnedst body to invest and cover in princely guards  the stupid editors says dr warburton whose note in this passage dr johnson has quoted mistaking guards for satellites whereas it here signifies lace altered priestly in both places to princely whereas shakespeare wrote it priestly as appears from the words themselves  it is the cunning livery of hell the damnedst body to invest and cover with priestly guards in the first place we see that guards here signify lace as referring to livery and as having no sense in the signification of satellites now priestly guards means sanctity which is the sense required but princely guards means nothing but rich lace which is a sense the passage will not bear angelo indeed as deputy might be called the princely angelo but not in this place where the immediately preceding words of this outwardsainted deputy demand the reading i have restored  to this very curious argument of dr warburtons the present editor only adds the following note  the first folio has in both places prenzie from which the other folios made princely and every editor may make what he can  it is really very kind of dr johnson to give others leave to make something of what he can make nothing himself  let us see therefore what others have made of it  the author of the canons of criticism objects to dr warburtons emendation observing that if princely guards means nothing but rich lace he should be glad to know how priestly guards should come to signify any thing more than black lace  the author of the revisal of shakespeares text goes still farther and says we should undoubtedly restore the ancient reading in both places the princely angelo and in princely guards nothing says he can be weaker and more destitute of all foundation than mr warburtons criticism angelo is represented as supporting the state of a prince and the authority of government by excessive severity but there is not the least hint given in the whole play of his affecting a sanctified exterior or setting up for a devotee priestly guards we are told means sanctity but how the body could be invested or covered with sanctity mr warburton has not thought proper to explain for i presume he does not imagine that he wore the priestly habit to which he could be no way entitled as appears by his marriage afterward as well as from many other circumstances needless to enumerate in princely guards most certainly signifies in a habit adorned as becomes a prince  if it be thought necessary to add any thing to these remarks it may be observed that the word guards is not strictly confined to mean lace as dr warburton insinuates but is used for ornaments of dress or finery in general thus shakespeare in some other of his plays i think it is in loves labor lost speaks of the guards of cupids hose in all probability meaning the clocks of his stockings i am well aware that our ancestors wearing long hose sometimes included their breeches too under that denomination but i cannot suppose this part of the dress would be particularly specified if lace merely was intended unless cupid might be supposed to have worn laced breeches without having a laced coat    which could not with propriety be called lace dr warburton indeed thinks the word livery in this sentence fixes that of guards to mere lace because it is true most liveries are laced it does not however follow that lace is essential to a livery or that a livery might not be given to servants without any lace in the trimming of it for the word livery comes either from the french livree of livrer to deliver or give or from the italian livrea or the spanish librea all having the same meaning so that a suit of clothes with trimmings of a different color given to a servant is as much a livery as if it were covered with lace again to come nearer the point can we suppose that when bassanio in the merchant of venice commands his followers to give lancelot  a livery more guarded than his fellows he means particularly that it should have more lace on it no surely he only means that it should on the whole be more fine and gaudy  the meaning of the words thus settled it is with great propriety isabel calls the princely badges and ducal finery of angelo the cunning livery of hell as being given him in order that he might the more effectually serve its abhorred and damnable purposes  vol i page     elbow come your way sir bless you good father friar  duke and you good brother father what offense has this man made you sir    father this word should be expunged  why so dr johnson  what offense has this word done you sir why will you not indulge the fictitious friar in the harmless jest he intends to make of the ignorance of the poor constable you will say perhaps you saw no jest intended i believe you but certainly such a one as it was there was one intended and this it is the word friar being a corruption of the french word friar meaning brother the constable had in fact called the supposed friar good father brother to which the other jocosely replies by calling him in turn good brother father  the reader will now therefore expunge this word or let it stand as he thinks proper  vol i page     lucio what is there none of pigmalions images newly made woman to be had now for putting the hand in the pocket and extracting it clutched   dr warburton says the meaning of this passage is are there no women come out cured from a salivation and this explanation is implicitly adopted by dr johnson the author of the revisal however supposes the meaning of this very affected cant to be are there no fresh women no maidenheads to be had now for continues the reviser very gravely pigmalions statue newly made woman was certainly a pure virgin  now not to controvert the virginity of a marble statue or to query how long it remained so when converted into flesh and blood in the hands of pig what do ye call him malion that longed to use her like a stallion cottons virgil travestie i conceive these scholiasts to be all mistaken with regard to the sense of the passage it is perfectly agreeable to the character of lucio to call an innocent uncomeatable virgin a pigmalions statue nor could he with any propriety give that name to a prostitute either under a salivation or newly come out of it what he meant therefore by pigmalions images newly made women was young girls newly debauched the deflowering a maid is frequently called by dramatic writers the making a woman of her again i think it pretty evident that lucio is too well acquainted with rogues and bawds too deep in the trick of it not to know that maidenheads were commodities they seldom dealt in on the other hand i think it as plain that lucio did not ask after such battered brims as might be just come out of the powdering tub for when the clown tells him his mistress is herself in that situation he says it is good it is the right of it it must be so ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd an unshunnd consequence it must be so  i fancy lucio would be apt to think such pickled devils as came out of the powdering tub sound as they possibly might be too stale to be called fresh meat  ibid  what reply ha what say thou to this tune matter and method is it not drowned in the last reign ha what say thou trot this strange nonsense says dr warburton should be thus corrected it is not down in the last reign i e these are severities unknown to the old dukes time and this is to the purpose  very much to the purpose truly and so the ingenious author of the canons of criticism has shown see canons of criticism page     notwithstanding which our editor without taking the least notice of what mr edwards has advanced proceeds thus dr warburtons emendation is ingenious but i know not whether the sense may not be restored with less change let us consider it lucio a prating fop meets his old friend going to prison and pours out upon him his impertinent interrogatories to which when the poor fellow makes no answer he adds what reply ha what say thou to this tune matter and method  is it not drowned in the last rain ha what say thou trot etc it is a common phrase used in low raillery of a man crestfallen and dejected that he looks like a drowned puppy lucio therefore asks him whether he was drowned in the last rain and therefore cannot speak  dr johnsons explanation of this passage is in my opinion less clear and much less consistent with his own pointing than that given by mr edwards indeed the latter supposes pompeys answer only to be drowned in the last rain a proverbial phrase he says to express a thing which is lost or rather not to be found whereas dr johnson supposes that pompey himself is taxed with having been drowned in the last rain taking their own authority however for the use of their proverbs mr edwardss explanation is not half so farfetched as dr johnsons it is indeed a strange roundabout kind of salutation to ask a man whether or not he was drowned in the last rain because truly he looks dejected and therefore may be phraseologically compared to a drowned puppy  dr gray would make a farther emendation of the text in this passage of which our editor has made mention in his appendix but seems to disapprove it the doctor proposes that instead of reading what say thou trot we should read what say thou to it the word trot being seldom if ever used to a man  to this dr johnson replies trot or as it is now often pronounced honest trout is a familiar address to a man among the provincial vulgar now it appears to me although i think dr grays emendation very admissible that lucio might very probably here mean to give pompey an appellation usually given to women by way of gibing him for following so scandalous an employment as that of a bawd usually practiced by wretches of that sex but be this as it may i think nobody can hesitate about dr johnsons being in the wrong when he supposes that lucio might call pompey bum the cockbawd honest trout  trout indeed dr johnson surely must imagine his readers to be very gudgeons to bait his hook with such grubs as these grubstreet annotations  vol i pages     and   0 are inserted two notes from dr warburton without any remark of the editors notwithstanding they are both sufficiently refuted and exploded in the canons of criticism pages    and    i must beg leave however for that reason to pass them over here  vol i page     escal double and treble admonition and still forfeit in the same kind this would make mercy swear and play the tyrant   i doubt not but my readers have already observed that when dr johnsons sentiments coincide with dr warburtons he does not choose to hazard them for his own as he does when they agree with those of edwards and some others but for fear they should be wrong he takes advantage of the verbum sacerdotis and skulks behind the name of warburton this he does with regard to the passage now before us and yet if i should admit a single emendation of all those dr warburton proposes i believe it would be this and yet i dont approve of it but the case is i as little approve of what is advanced by others in favor of the present reading and yet as dr johnson says nothing better suggests itself dr warburton says we should read swerve i e deviate from her nature the common reading gives us the idea of a ranting whore in opposition to this the author of the revisal says the common reading is agreeable to a very common form of expression this would make a saint swear and supposes it means no more than that the excess of the provocation would get the better of the mild disposition even of mercy herself and put her in a passion in answer again to this however it may be observed that we have no such very common form of speech as is here asserted nay i dont know that we can possibly have occasion for such a form make a saint swear pray where are there any saints nowadays to be met with for my part i never conversed with any but fictitious ones i have heard indeed of things being provoking enough to make a parson swear and that even in the middle of his sermon but alas alas there is a great difference between saints and parsons though i hope the author of the revisal is too honest a man wilfully to impose a parson on his readers for a saint  the true state of the case appears to me to be as follows the poet did not intend or at least did not effect a complete personification of mercy if he had he would not have given us the idea of a ranting whore as dr warburton justly expresses it nor would he have represented mercy as stripped of her attributes or put in a passion as the reviser has it  it seems to me that escalus speaks of that mercy or merciful disposition existing in his own breast agreeable and in reply to what the bawd had said to him in the preceding speech your honor is accounted a merciful man to which he answers yes but such provocation would make me merciful as i am swear and play the tyrant to this it may be objected that escalus represents himself in this case as a ranting bully just as mercy in the other gives the idea of a ranting whore so that perhaps after all we had better abide by the literal construction of the text and suppose the prosopopeia complete in which case to swear must mean to make a vow never to be moved by pleas or intercession to be unrelenting being one of the principal characteristics of a tyrant  vol i page     prove a man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but as a drunken sleep careless reckless and fearless of what is past present or to come insensible of mortality and desperately mortal   desperately mortal this expression is obscure sir thomas hanmer reads mortally desperate mortally is in low conversation used in this sense but i know not whether it was ever written i am inclined to believe that desperately mortal means desperately mischievous  i wish dr johnson every time he had dictated any of the articles of his critical creed had given us a reason for the faith that is in him why he should believe barnardine to be desperately mischievous i cannot possibly conceive the provost seems to give him a very different character he has evermore says he had the liberty of the prison give him leave to escape hence he would not drunk many times a day if not many days entirely drunk we have very often awaked him as if to carry him to execution and showed him a seeming warrant for it it has not moved him at all is this the description of a man desperately mischievous i should rather think that by desperately mortal means totally incurable of diseases acquired by his beastly course of life or else that despairing or careless of life he looks upon himself as dead to the world and takes no thought of what becomes of him that he is yet desperate or inflexibly obstinate about even dying is plain from his telling the friar that he will not die that day for any mans persuasion but if they will have it so they shall beat out his brains with billets  vol i page     oh that it were as like as it is true dr johnson has on this passage silently adopted the explanation of mr edwards in opposition to that of dr warburton he does the same thing again in page      see canons of criticism page      vol i page     peter  and what he with his oath by all probation will make up full clear whenever he is convented first for this woman  dr johnson has here inserted the word convented instead of convened which was the common reading convented indeed was the reading of the first folio which dr warburton insists upon to be right and yet dr warburton as the author of the revisal shrewdly remarks calls that edition on another occasion the old blundering folio  giving his reasons for it in the following arrogant and foolish note which is as impertinently and fillily adopted by our editor the first folio reads convented and this is right for to convene signifies to assemble but convent to cite or summons yet because convented hurts the measure the oxford editor sticks to convened though it be nonsense and signifies whenever he is assembled together but thus it will be when the author is thinking of one thing and his critic of another the poet was attentive to his sense and the editor quite throughout his performance to nothing but the measure which shakespeare having entirely neglected like all the dramatic writers of that age he has spruced him up with all the exactness of a modern measurer of syllables  i should be glad to know how either dr warburton or dr johnson came to know that shakespeare entirely neglected measure shakespeare had a poetical ear and though he might not stand to count his fingers as probably these gentlemen do when they write verses he wrote in general much more melodiously than any of the dramatic writers of his own age or perhaps of the present the oxford editor did very wisely therefore in abiding by the measure as he could do it without any injury to the sense for to convene as the author of the revisal justly observes means not only to assemble together but to cite or cause to appear and is rendered in latin by cito cieo  to this i may add also that cito does not mean simply to cite or summons in general but also to summons or produce as a witness exactly agreeable to the case before us thus cicero in hac re te testem citabo but perhaps these learned gentlemen will object to all this because the verb convene is not derived from cito cico but from convenio they will profit little however by this evasion for the verb convenio itself is used in the sense of giving a citation or summons thus plautus illum in jus conveniam but supposing these quotations to be as learned quotations generally are nothing at all to the purpose i may safely borrow a phrase from scripture on this occasion and say to dr johnson out of thy own mouth will i judge thee thou careless commentator the author of the revisal seems a little unhappy that having kept no commonplacebook he cannot produce an example of the use of the word convene in the sense contended for but if he had turned to dr johnsons commonplacebook i e his folio dictionary he would have there found that this sense is properly authorized to convene says the lexicographer is to summon judicially as a proof of which he quotes the following passage from ayliffe by the papal canon law clerks in criminal and civil causes cannot be convened before any but an ecclesiastical judge  what a pity it is there should be so little connection between samuel johnson m a the lexicographer and dr johnson the commentator but so it is nor is it any thing new people are apt to forget themselves as they rise to preferment  vol i page     duke  laws for all faults but faults so countenanced that the strong statutes stand like the forfeits in a barbers shop as much in mock as mark  our editor appears to know very little of the provincial customs and manners of his countrymen he would else i think hardly have been under the necessity of being obliged to dr gray and recurring back two or three centuries for the beggars clackdish see vol i page     also dr johnsons appendix vol viii  which i myself remember to have seen carried about by those itinerants in many towns and villages in different counties of england again dr johnson is equally at a loss with respect to the passage before us he has not omitted however to display dr warburtons erudition and sagacity on the occasion  stand like the forfeits in a barbers shop barbers shops were at all times the resort of idle people tonstrina erat quaedam hic solebamus fere plerumque eam opperiri  which donatus calls apta seeds otiosis formerly with us the better sort of people went to the barbers shop to be trimmed who then practiced the underparts of surgery so that he had occasion for numerous instruments which lay there ready for use and the idle people with whom his shop was generally crowded would be perpetually handling and misusing them to remedy which i suppose there was placed up against the wall a table of forfeitures adapted to every offense of this kind which it is not likely would long preserve its authority  such is dr warburtons explanation of this passage which our editor says may serve till a better is discovered he observes nevertheless that whoever has seen the instruments of a surgeon knows that they may be very easily kept out of improper hands in a very small box or in his pocket  the truth is that the tables of forfeits hung up in barbers shops are still extant in some parts of england at least i remember to have seen one about twelve or thirteen years ago in an excursion from burlington to northallerton in yorkshire i think it was either at malton or at thirsk and very probably it is there still i do not indeed recollect the name of the operator in whose shop it was affixed but its contents struck me so much on reading that i believe i can recite them from memory pretty exactly they do not relate however to the handling of chirurgical instruments but to civility and good behavior and seem not injudiciously calculated for a place where persons of different stations and degrees were accustomed to meet in order to be successively shaved these statutes were in rhyme and were entitled rules for seemly behavior first come first serve  then come not late and when arrived keep your state that is behave yourself agreeably to your station  for he who from these rules shall swerve must pay the forfeits  so observe  i who enters here with boots and spurs must keep his nook for if he stirs and gives with armed heel a kick a pint he pays for every prick ii who rudely takes anothers turn a forfeit mug may manners learn learn for teach a common perversion of language the meaning is that by being made to forfeit he may thence learn better manners than to want another time to be shaved out of his turn  iii who reverentless shall swear or curse must lug seven probably the price of a pint of beer farthings from his purse iv who checks the barber in his tale must pay for each it is not clear whether for each means what the artizans call pintsapiece i e a pint for every person in the shop if so the interrupting the barber in his tale was held to be a grievous offense indeed  but perhaps for each means only for each offense in which case however it is not accurately expressed   a pot of ale v who will or can not miss to miss in that part of yorkshire means to spare or to be without thus a man forfeited a pint for insisting upon being shaved with his hat on his hat while trimming pays a pint for that vi and he who can or will not pay shall hence be sent halftrimmd there is some humor in the penalty of sending the refractory away halfshaved and it is not impossible that the ingenious author of the upholsterer took one of his best hints from these rules there is also no less morally in the two last lines excellently calculated to discourage the vice of ebriety   away for willhe nillhe if in fault he forfeit must in meal or malt but mark  who is alreads in drink the cannikin must never clink   vol i page     lucio do you so sir and was the duke a fleshmonger a fool and a coward as you then reported him to be   dr johnson who seems constantly on the watch to catch shakespeare tripping observes here that lucio had not in the former conversation mentioned cowardice among the faults of the duke but says he very graciously such failures of memory are incident to writers more diligent than this poet  on this occasion i cannot help remarking that it is somewhat singular to find our editor so extremely remiss and negligent in illustrating the beauties of shakespeare and so very diligent in discovering his faults this carping critic is in this particular however egregiously mistaken there being no grounds for charging the poet in this place with want of attention to his plot it is true that lucio does not expressly call the duke a coward in that part of their conversation which passed on the stage in scene vi act   our editor might have observed however that he has a farther conversation with him in scene xi act   where he begins again to talk of the old fantastical duke of dark corners and when the duke wants to shake him off by bidding him farewell and telling him his company is fairer than honest lucio will not be thus got rid of but follows him saying by my troth i will go with thee to the lanes end if bawdy talk offend you well have very little of it nay friar i am a kind of bur i shall stick is it not very natural to suppose that lucio might afterward call the duke a coward considering the many opprobrious names he had already given him and is the poet to be censured because he has made the duke charge lucio with a single word of detraction which was not actually spoken before the audience if this be not hypercriticism i know not what is but to make the matter worse on the part of our unfortunate editor the duke does not charge lucio with calling him a coward at the time when he runs on enumerating his other vices for this was in the open street through which the officers passed in carrying the bawds to prison but the time is particularly specified when he called him coward which was when the duke met him in the prison and as i above remarked could not get rid of him this is plain from the context  lucio come hither goodman baldpate do you know me   duke i remember you sir by the sound of your voice i met you at the prison in the absence of the duke   lucio oh did you so and do you remember what you said of the duke   duke most notedly sir   lucio do you so sir and was the duke a fleshmonger a fool a coward as you then reported him to be   duke you must sir change persons with me ere you make that my report you spoke so of him and much more much worse   surely dr johnson must have invidiously sought occasion to depreciate the merit of shakespeare or he could never have laid hold of so groundless a pretext to cavil either at his inattention or want of memory  vol i page     duke it was the swift celerity of his death which i did think with flower foot came on that brained my purpose  dr warburton would alter the text to baned my purpose the futility of this emendation however is if i mistake not sufficiently exposed by the author of the canons of criticism whose opinion dr johnson adopts without making any mention of him as usual  vol i page     isab most bounteous sir look if it please you on this man condemned as if my brother lived i partly think a due sincerity governed his deeds till he did look on me since it is so let him not die  dr johnson has in my opinion a very exceptionable note on this passage i shall quote it therefore entire and make my observations on it afterward the duke has justly observed that isabel is importuned against all sense to solicit for angelo yet here against all sense she solicits for him her argument is extraordinary a due sincerity governed his deeds till he did look on me since it is so let him not die that angelo had committed all the crimes charged against him as far as he could commit them is evident the only intent which his act did not overtake was the defilement of isabel of this angelo was only intentionally guilty  angelos crimes were such as must sufficiently justify punishment whether its end be to secure the innocent from wrong or to deter guilt by example and i believe every reader feels some indignation when he finds him spared from what extenuation of his crime can isabel who yet supposes her brother dead form any plea in his favor since he was good till he looked on me let him not die i am afraid our varlet poet intended to inculcate that women think ill of nothing that raises the credit of their beauty and are ready however virtuous to pardon any act which they think incited by their own charms  to expose the several fallacies suggested throughout the above note i shall observe first that it was very natural for mariana to solicit isabels intercession for her husband the man she so much loved i cannot think also that it is in any respect out of character for isabel after repeated solicitations to be moved to oblige mariana who had already obliged her so far at least as to prevent the apparent necessity of prostituting herself to angelo especially if we reflect on the tranquil state of mind she seems to be in with regard to her brother in whose supposed death she appears to have acquiesced either from principles of religion or philosophy for when the duke in the foregoing page speaking of her brother says  peace be with him that life is better life past fearing death than that which lives to fear make it your comfort so happy is your brother isabel answers i do my lord from a principle of philosophy she must be very conscious that the death of angelo could not bring her brother to life again and if to this reflection we suppose her religion might add the suggestion of christian charity and forgiveness i do not see any impropriety in isabels soliciting angelos pardon  as to the argument she makes use of and which dr johnson thinks so very extraordinary it is to be observed that she does not make use of it as a positive plea but introduces it with  i partly think a due sincerity etc again dr johnson says the only intent which his act did not overtake was the defilement of isabel surely dr johnson forgets the intended execution of claudio there is no doubt that angelos guilty intentions fully deserved punishment but as the principal of them failed of being carried into execution i do not see why the reader should feel so much indignation at his being pardoned especially as he must perceive the propriety of doing poetical justice to the injured mariana which would not be the case if her newmade husband were to be immediately punished with the severity due to his wicked designs  as to the sinister meaning he imputes to the poet of intending a covert satire on the fair sex i think enough is already said to exculpate him i wish therefore dr johnson were equally excusable for giving shakespeare the appellation of varlet poet our editor can hardly intend here to confine that term to its simple and ancient meaning for where is the jest or propriety of calling shakespeare a yeoman or servant agreeably to the old meaning of the word varlet which like fur in latin it is allowed originally conveyed no base or opprobrious idea  and yet if dr johnson did not use the word in this limited and antiquated sense what can he mean by calling shakespeare a mean sorry or rascally poet for this is the modern sense of the word and in this sense the word varletry is inserted in a certain folio dictionary on the authority of shakespeare himself  perhaps indeed dr johnson only meant here to express himself in a strain of wit and pleasantry if so let him beware how he attempts to be witty again for surely never was such an awkward attempt made before it is not in his nature  the merchant of venice vol i page     gra  silence is only commendable in a neats tongue dried and a maid not vendible  anth is that any thing now  all the old copies it is said read it is that any thing now this being palpably defective the later ones in general read as above but dr johnson supposes that we should read is that any thing new for my part however i can see no propriety in this supposition of novelty nor do i think the reader will conceive there is any room for the proposed alteration if he considers the following answer of bassanio  gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing more than any man in venice his reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two byshels of chaff you shall seek all day ere you find them and when you have them they are not worth the search  gratiano is indeed censured just before for being an eternal talker and when he goes out repeating the above couplet anthonio says is that any thing now intimating that though he is so full of talk there is nothing i e no meaning in it and thus it is plain bassanio understood him by his answering  true he speaks an infinite deal of nothing  vol i page   0 lancelot looking on his palm well if any man in italy have a fairer table which does offer to swear upon a book  i shall have good fortune here is a small trifle of wives etc   this passage has given the commentators a world of trouble it seems generally agreed that mr theobalds explanation is still more inexplicable than the text itself dr johnson inserts it however for what reason i cannot divine unless it be to swell his book or to serve as a foil to the superior sagacity of dr warburton and himself whose notes immediately follow i shall only quote those of the two latter  which does offer to swear upon a book this nonsense seems to have taken its rise from the accident of a lost line in transcribing the play for the press so that the passage for the future should be printed thus well if any man in italy have a fairer table which does      offer to swear upon a book i shall have good fortune it is impossible to find again the lost line but the lost sense is easy enough  if any man in italy have a fairer table which does promise good luck i am mistaken i durst almost offer to swear upon a book i shall have good fortune dr johnson after condemning theobalds note in the severest terms and informing us that by table is meant the palm expanded goes on very magisterially thus  dr warburton understood the word a mighty matter to understand truly which is familiar to every strolling gypsy and as well known to every kitchenwench who can make shift to spell the egyptian fortune teller palmistry laid open or the twopenny chiromancer  but puzzles himself with no great success in pursuit of the meaning  no wonder at that dr johnson people seldom puzzle themselves with any great success in pursuit of any thing  but to proceed with our editors note the whole matter is this lancelot congratulates himself upon his dexterity and good fortune and in the height of his rapture inspects his hand and congratulates himself upon the felicities in his table the act of expounding his hand puts him in mind of the action in which the palm is shown by raising it to lay it on the book in judicial attestations well says he if any man in italy have a fairer table that does offer to swear upon a book  here he stops with an abruptness very common and proceeds to particulars  no sir he does not stop here but goes on agreeable to dr warburtons explanation to say what is to be sworn upon the book i e that he shall have good fortune but this is not to be sworn either by lancelot himself or by any other italian it is the hand itself that promises so strongly and as it were offers to swear upon a book that he shall have good fortune and in this sense the author of the revisal takes it though i think he has not hit off the meaning quite happily his interpretation is if any man in italy have a fairer table which pronounces that i shall have good fortune with as much assurance as if it was ready to swear it upon a book  here says he the sentence breaks off and we must supply i am mistaken or some other expression of like import  none of these commentators though very sensible of the break in this passage seem to know where it lies but if i might be allowed to take the most trifling liberty in the world with the text i dare say the reader would see the whole meaning and propriety of it at one view  well if any man in italy have a fairer table  why it does offer to swear upon a book i shall have good fortune  go to etc taking the words also in this sense there is a beauty and propriety in saying the palm offers to swear upon a book because in judicial attestations the essential part of the form lies in kissing the book which the hand may not be improperly said to do even in laying hold of it dr johnson apparently having a confused idea of a court of justice in his head confounds the action of a criminal holding up his hand at the bar with that of a witness qualifying himself by oath to give evidence against him the former indeed must of course display the palm but i believe the latter seldom or never does  vol i page     all that glisters is not gold often have you heard that told etc on these verses dr johnson has two notes in each of which he proposes an emendation in the text and i must do him the justice to own that i think them both judicious and unexceptionable he would have saved me some little trouble si sic omnia dixisset  vol i page     duke upon my power i may dismiss the court unless bellario a learned doctor whom i have sent for to determine this come here today  bellario a learned doctor whom i have sent for  the doctor and court are here somewhat unskilfully brought together that the duke would on such an occasion consult a doctor of great reputation is not unlikely but how should this be foreknown by portia  why will you dr johnson be thus constantly seeking occasion to find fault with shakespeare for misconduct in his drama the business of which you are evidently much too unskilled in to have a right to take upon you the authority of censuring the foremost man of all this world  you admit it to be right that dr bellario whom we may very well suppose to be a civilian of the first rank should be sent for to advise in this cause you know too i imagine or at least you might have known if you had read the play that this same dr bellario for he was a doctor too we are all doctors dr johnson was a relation a cousin to portia this being premised is it not very natural to suppose that after bassanio was called away in such haste to venice on account of the prosecution carried on against his friend anthonio his bride portia would send a messenger to her cousin bellario in order to ask his opinion of so extraordinary a case or to interest him in anthonios behalf and can any thing be more probable than that he should inform her on receiving such a message that he was actually sent for to venice on that very account for it is to be observed that the duke speaks as if he had sent for him some considerable time before for he says unless bellario etc come here to day his power of dismissing the court also on his not coming seems founded on some physical or moral impediment that might very naturally occur to prevent his arrival within the time so that he must be supposed either at such a distance as made it necessary to give him a considerable timely warning or that the extraordinary nature of the cause might make him require so much the more time to prepare himself equitably to determine it  this being the state of the case was not here a very apt foundation on which to build portias plot of officiating for the doctor which design she no doubt concerted with him by letter before she sent for the notes and clothes mentioned scene v act iii it may not be amiss to observe here that i have known some spectators impute the device by which anthonio evades the penalty of the bond to the ingenuity of portia  perhaps this is the case indeed with the audience in general  but as i think it a little out of character in a young lady of her education to be so well versed in the quirks and quibbles of the law so i conceive there is sufficient reason given in the play to suppose that evasion to have been suggested by bellario  for she expressly mentions to the messenger notes and aths these notes were doubtless the brief or hints for her pleading and bellario says in his letter to the duke speaking of the fictitious doctor he is furnished with my opinion so that i am so far from thinking that shakespeare as dr johnson supposes represents portia to be a prophetess or a witch that i conceive his readers in general are apt to think her much more shrewd than he describes her at least i dare say dr johnsons readers will conclude from this specimen of his sagacity that whether portia was a witch or not he is no conjurer    and that this was really the case seems evident from what portia says to jessica during the absence of bassanio and before she sends balthazar to bellario for the notes and clothes  jessica compliments her on  a noble and a true conceit of godlike amity which appears most strongly in bearing thus the absence of her lord a sufficient intimation i think that bassanio must have been gone some time again in portias reply to this compliment she says  this anthonio being the bosomlover of my lord must needs be like my lord if it be so how little is the cost i have bestowed in purchasing the semblance of my soul from out the state of hellish cruelty here we find portia speaking very peremptorily and certainly of anthonios deliverance and of the cost already bestowed to effect it is it reasonable to think she would express herself thus confidently on a mere suggestion of her own besides what cost could she have bestowed her having bid her husband pay the bond three times over was nothing because she could not be sure the money would be taken nay she evidently does not intend to trust to that acceptance it is therefore i think very evident that she had even at this time concerted the scheme with her cousin bellario how far belmont might be from either venice or padua i cannot exactly say but it appears from circumstances that it could not be very far from belmont to venice it seems there was a common traject or ferry so that the distance of both from padua could not be too great for transacting the business in question  it is true that the formality with which port a introduces her charge to balthazar when she sends him for the notes and clothes seems to favor the supposition that this was the first time she had sent to bellario in which case there would be some grounds for dr johnsons remark but we must observe that balthazar is now to be entrusted with a more important charge than he had before been in merely carrying and bringing back a letter or it is not unlikely that portia entrusted that business with a servant of less importance all these things duly considered it is plain i think that dr johnson has very rashly and unadvisedly presumed to call shakespeare unskilful because he wanted skill himself i shall dismiss this note therefore with advising our editor never to wade so far out of his depth for the future it is a trite adage but it is a very good one and worthy to be observed ne suitor ultra crepidam i do not say that dr johnson may not probably be well skilled in some things not that i know that he is well skilled in any i will except indeed the article of literary composition in which so far as the merit of a speech an essay a life or a novel goes he is undoubtedly the best writer in christendom but his merit even here is in a great measure mechanical and may be justly accounted for in a manner that will do little honor either to his boasted genius or learning  for though i have read all his works i declare he does not appear to me at least so far as i myself am able to judge to be master of any one science or any one language so that he must not plume himself on my suffrage not that i deny him to be master of the whole circle of sciences and of all languages ancient and modern but if it be so if it be really true as his friends inform me that he is possessed of such amazing stores of literary and scientific knowledge i cannot help thinking him extremely culpable not to say very ungrateful to keep them all avariciously to himself and fob off the public with mere shreds and patches how dare dr johnson treat that public with so much contempt which has done him such extravagant honor how dare he behave to that public with such imparalelld ingratitude which has given him such imparalelld such avowed such unmerited encouragement  it is true that its having done all this is sufficient to give dr johnson a very mean opinion of its spirit taste and judgment but he should have been aware of carrying the imposition too far he should not have presumed to think that this public tasteless and ignorant as he may suppose it could ever be prevailed on to grace his waving noddle with a wreath irreverently torn from the brows of shakespeare  the selfsufficient the arrogant dr johnson may possibly conceive that the zeal with which the very name of shakespeare inspires me is counterfeited and that i express myself thus warmly to provoke him to a reply  no dr johnson you cannot reply i must join in that deference which i think the world has undeservedly paid you so far as to own that i should never have presumed to publish any thing against dr johnson that i had not good reason to think unanswerable it is indeed prudential in you to make a virtue of necessity and previously to give out that you will not do what you have so much reason to think you can not do  yet you have your satellites your lighttroops you may send them out to harrass the enemy whom you dare not encounter but as i am no farther your enemy than as you are shakespeares send who you will as many as you will i will undertake under so gallant a leader to rout an army of scribblers to crush a myriad of cockleshell critics in his cause  vol i page     mess  i bring word my mistress will before the break of day be here at belmont she does stray about by holy crosses where she kneels and prays for happy wedlock hours  lor who comes with her  mess none but a holy hermit and her maid  none but a holy hermit i do not perceive the use of this hermit of whom nothing is seen or heard afterward the poet had first planned his fable some other way and inadvertently when he changed his scheme retained something of the original design  how the poet blundering again  why what a blockhead this shakespeare must be dr johnson eh  nay if you object to giving the appellation to shakespeare we must bestow it on somebody else the word is blurted out and cannot be recalled let us see if it will apply as the lawyers say to the author of the above comment   he does not perceive the use of the hermit because nothing is seen or heard of him afterward  pray is any thing seen of him now he is not brought on the scene and may for ought that effects the business of the play exist only in nubibus there is no doubt that the messenger tells a lie respecting the employment of his mistress and why may he not do the same respecting her attendants  but perhaps the commentator may not see the use of the fiction neither and will therefore condemn this part of the messengers lie as unnecessary he would do well to recollect however that although nothing is heard about a hermit afterward a sufficient reason was given before to speak of one in this message which is evidently a contrivance of portia to support the imposition she is carrying on it is to be remembered that when portia takes her leave of lorenzo and jessica putting the management of her house and family in their hands act iii scene   she says  for mine own part i have towered heaven breathed a secret vow to live in prayer and contemplation only attended by nerissa here until her husband and my lords return there is a monastery two miles off and there we will abide now having told them this fib at her departure nothing could be more pertinent or indeed necessary to keep up the probability of the story than for the messenger to say she was attended by a hermit as it would be both unseemly and dangerous for two women to stray about kneeling and praying by holy crosses without a male attendant and who so proper on such an occasion as an holy hermit whose sacred character might protect them from insult  this is sufficient to show that it was not unnecessary but very pertinent to the plot to have a hermit here spoken of which is all the poet has done  add to this that after all it is possible there might really be a hermit in the case though it was needless that he should appear for the messenger himself might not be in the plot and portia have employed a hermit to deliver him the message from portia as he actually did deliver it to lorenzo unless we are to suppose that holy hermits are too inflexibly attached to truth to assist even in so innocent an imposture which i who have had the honor of knowing some of those gentry conceive not to be the case  as you like it vol ii page    amiens sings blow blow thou winter wind thou art not so unkind as mans ingratitude thy tooth is not so keen because thou art not seen although thy breath be rude  there cannot i think be a more flagrant instance of that perversity of apprehension which seems to have distinguished almost all our poets commentators than the difficulty they have raised about this passage it is true they have in general been much more successful in throwing obstructions in the way of the reader than in obviating those which common sense and simple ingenuity might naturally suggest for my part i should never have dreamt that these verses so greatly needed illustration that they were corrupted or that a line was lost and badly restored unless the learned dr warburton had told me of the first the ingenious and sensible authors of the canons of criticism and of the revisal had insinuated the second and lastly the learned ingenious and sensible dr johnson attempted to persuade me of the third indeed they have all successfully labored to throw some obscurity on the text mr edwards not excepted for though he has facetiously and justly exposed dr warburtons ridiculous emendation of the fifth line he has left the reader to explain the passage himself after assuring him that it certainly is faulty  it will i presume afford some entertainment to the reader to compare the several notes of these annotators by which they will see how they have all blundered roundabout the poets meaning perhaps for no other reason in the world than that they imagined it lay much deeper than it really does it is not an uncommon thing for persons immoderately sagacious to look too far forward and stumble over what lies immediately under their nose dr johnson appears indeed to have a very different opinion of this matter and seems to think that shakespeares meaning is always very profound thus he tells us the original and predominant error of dr warburtons commentary is acquiescence in his first thoughts that precipitation which is produced by consciousness of quick discernment and that confidence which presumes to do by surveying the surface what labor only can perform by penetrating the bottom see preface to dr johnsons shakespeare   for my part i had always a very different opinion of dr warburtons commentary that he did too precipitately acquiesce in his own thoughts may be very true and that he surveyed only the surface of shakespeares writing may be no less so but that he went very deep into the recesses of his own imagination as well as into his stores of booklearning for all those farfetched allusions quaint epithets and literary conundrums which he imputes to shakespeare is i think not to be doubted for it is very true as our editor also observes that his notes exhibit perverse interpretations and improbable conjectures he at one time gives the author more profundity of meaning than the sentence admits and at another discovers absurdities where the sense is plain to every other reader see preface to dr johnsons shakespeare   it is very natural to conclude from this reprehension that dr johnson means to insinuate his having himself repaired the faults of dr warburton and effected that by perseverance and labor which the reverend scholiast his predecessor failed to do by his vivacity and precipitation it is certain that labor necessarily takes up time and so far the frequent procrastination of the present edition affords dr johnson a plausible excuse for pretending to have labored but on the other hand it is as certain that time does not necessarily include labor for it is notorious that an industrious gerundgrinder may do as much or more in a month than an idler will do in seven years it is also farther certain that although youth and inexperience may be too hasty and precipitate yet experience and age cannot well execute their work too expeditiously in the former case delay may serve to correct errors and check the inordinance and exuberance of zeal in the latter it produces only languor and perplexity thus if dr johnson instead of spiritedly repairing the neglect of those who only surveyed the surface had boldly and immediately penetrated to the bottom all had possibly been right but instead of doing this it appears he has been full as much too tardy as they were precipitate and thus leaving the weight of his learning and the force of his reputation to work their way without the least application of genius he has suffered them by long and constant friction to perforate or to penetrate as he says the bottom itself so that the superficial meanings which former editors skimmed from the top are left hanging about the sides of the vessel while the profound discoveries weighty arguments and striking illustrations expected in the present edition are all escaped through the hole which dr johnsons modest industry and vast erudition have worked through the bottom  but to leave this digression and return to the notes of the several commentators dr warburtons as it is inserted by way of preference no doubt in the page before us runs thus  thy tooth is not so keen because thou art not seen this song is designed to suit the dukes exiled condition who had been ruined by ungrateful flatterers now the winter wind the song says is to be preferred to mans ingratitude but why because it is not seen but this was not only an aggravation of the injury as it was done in secret not seen but was the very circumstance that made the keenness of the ingratitude of his faithless courtiers without doubt shakespeare wrote the line thus because thou art not sheen i e smiling and shining like an ungrateful courtservant who flatters while he wounds which was a very good reason for giving the winter wind the preference so in the midsummer nights dream spangled star light sheen and several other places chaucer uses it in this sense your blissful suster lucina the shene and fairfax the sacred angel took his target shene and by the christian champion stood unseen the oxford editor who had this emendation communicated to him takes occasion from thence to alter the whole line thus thou causest not that teen but in his rage of correction he forgot to leave the reason which is now wanting why the winter wind was to be preferred to mans ingratitude  on this curious comment the author of the canons of criticism has made the following remarks  this passage meaning the two lines quoted from the text is certainly faulty and perhaps it cannot be restored as shakespeare gave it sir thomas hanmer at last altered it into sense thou causest not that teen but this it seems will not do because in his rage of correction he forgot to leave the reason why the winter wind was to be preferred to mans ingratitude so now mr warburton comes with his emendation which he charitably communicated to sir thomas though he was so graceless as not to make use of it because thou art not sheen though this matter is so clear with mr warburton every body who understands english will doubt of it because sheen signifies bright which makes no better sense than seen nor does he produce any authority for its signifying smiling which is the sense he here puts upon it and to make it pass the better he lugs in a parcel of smiling shining court servants who flatter while they wound of whom there is not the least hint in the song or in the whole scene  mr edwards then goes on to enumerate dr warburtons examples which having quoted above need not be repeated  he proceeds  these are the examples he produces whether wisely or not let the forest judge but the conceit of a smiling target is entirely his own and if be will allow me a pun invita minerva for it seems in direct opposition to the famed aegis of pallas but this is hardly a laughing matter for with what face can he say smiling shining  so shakespeare  chaucer uses it in this sense  and fairfax  when if he knows any thing of the language he must know that not one of them in these instances uses sheen in the sense of smiling and that in its true sense of bright or shining it would make the passage worse than he found it  if sir thomas hanmer as he says took occasion from having this emendation communicated to him to alter the whole line he showed more judgment than if he had inserted such a false and nonsensical note but in his rage of correction he forgot to leave the reason why the winter wind was to be preferred to mans ingratitude if sheen does not signify smiling i doubt mr warburton will be in the same case however shakespeare has equally forgotten in the next stanza to leave the reason why a freezing sky is to be preferred to a forgetful friend which perhaps may give a reasonable suspicion that the word because this ingenious writer does not intimate what he thinks might be the right word but if he be right in his suspicion i conceive that instead of the conjunction copulative because shakespeare must use the adverb or preposition disjunctive beside  in the first stanza may be corrupt  the author of the revisal of shakespeares text says what the meaning of the common reading because thou art not seen may be it is extremely difficult to discover which gives great ground for suspicion that it may be corrupt possibly it might be intended to be this the impressions thou make on us are not so cutting because thou art an unseen agent with whom we have not the least acquaintance or converse and therefore have the less reason to repine at thy treatment of us  to come now to dr johnson who after quoting dr warburtons note without mentioning a syllable of mr edwardss remarks on it proceeds thus i am afraid that no reader is satisfied with dr warburtons emendation however vigorously enforced and it is indeed enforced with more art than truth sheen i e smiling shining that sheen signifies shining is easily proved but when or where did it signify smiling yet smiling gives the sense necessary in this place sir thomas hanmers change is less uncouth but too remote from the present text for my part i question whether the original is not lost and this substituted merely to fill up the measures and the rhyme yet even out of this line by strong agitation may sense be elicited and sense not unsuitable to the occasion thou winter wind says the duke no dr johnson it is his cousin amiens sings it  thy rudeness gives the less pain as thou art not seen as thou art an enemy that do not brave us with thy presence and whose unkindness is therefore not aggravated by insult  after so many avowed assurances of the difficulty of the above passage and the unsuccessful though elaborate attempts to clear it up it may seem affectation in me to insist on its being very obvious i must declare however that before i had read any of the above criticisms it always seemed so though i must own i did not take either the particular meaning of the words or the general design of the song in the same manner as is done by any of the abovementioned critics dr warburton seems indeed to have misled them all by confounding ingratitude with pretended friendship or private enmity that flatterers are often secret enemies and generally ungrateful is very true but it is by no means essential to acts of ingratitude that they should be committed in secret and on the contrary though it be disingenuous mean and cowardly to do private injuries it may not be ungrateful for the doer may happen not be obliged to the person offended with regard also to the particular case before us there is no doubt but the banished duke had suffered enough from public and visible acts of ingratitude the wickedness of which would therefore be aggravated as dr johnson rightly says by insult and would not be like acts of false friendship or private enmity aggravated by being done in secret when dr johnson therefore adopting dr warburtons reasoning tells us that smiling gives the sense necessary in this place he is misled by the plausibility of that gentlemans argument there being no manner of occasion as mr edwards observes for the introduction of his flattering courtiers  having expatiated so much on the difficulty and misapprehension of the passage i come now to explain it that way in which i have ever understood it and according to which i think there is no manner of difficulty in reconciling the sense to the words as they now stand nay i flatter myself many readers will discover more beauty in this admirable little song than they were before acquainted with before i enter however on the explanation of particular words i shall consider the design and tendency of the song in general to this end it may be necessary to repeat the whole blow blow thou winter wind thou art not so unkind as mans ingratitude thy tooth is not so keen because thou art not seen although thy breath be rude heigh ho sing heigh ho etc freeze freeze thou bitter sky that do not bite so nigh as benefits forgot though thou the waters warp thy sting is not so sharp as friends remembered not heigh ho sing heigh ho etc the reader will observe that the first verse is addressed to the wind and the second to the sky by which latter is evidently meant the air or atmosphere as appears by the attritributes or qualities he imputes to it it is observable farther that the poet has with great judgment kept the properties and effects of both distinct beginning with the least hurtful and proceeding regularly in the climax to the most cutting and severe  this being premised i come now to the disputed meaning of the particular words and here all the scholiasts seem to blunder in mistaking the sense of the word keen in the fourth line which they take to signify sharp cutting piercing whereas it only means eager vehement a sense equally common with the former the poet speaks here only of a keenness of appetite he does not mention actual biting till he comes to address a more proper and powerful agent for though it be the property of the wind to bluster and make a noise it does not bite unless it bring with it a nipping frosty air it does not freeze more in an high wind than when its breath is neither felt nor heard but often less besides if keen here means sharp piercing etc this line has the same meaning as the seventh line of the second verse where the poet is at the last stage of his climax and i think he would hardly be guilty of such a piece of tautology in the space of so few lines or address the less severe and powerful agent exactly in the same manner as he does that which is more so  taking the word in this sense let us see its effect on the context  thy tooth is not so keen that is as much as to say thou art not so eager to bite thy appetite is not so voracious  thou art not so violent to distress us  because thou art not seen although thy breath be rude in other words because thou do not come in a visible form to confront us notwithstanding thou insultest us with thy abusive blustering  thou do not show thy grim looks though we hear thy roaring voice shakespeare uses breath for voice also in the twelfthnight sir andrew aguecheek i had rather than forty shillings i had so sweet a breath to sing as the fool has   the sight of those who have behaved to us with ingratitude is known to be particularly disgustful even though we should despise any thing they should say or do when out of our presence thus adam to his ungrateful eve in miltons paradise lost out of my sight thou serpent  it were indeed extremely offensive to see others show their teeth at us even though they could not bite perhaps shakespeare had some distant allusion to this proverbial phrase it is also observable that the invisibility of the wind was a circumstance which this great poet had frequently in his mind thus in measure for measure he speaks of the viewless winds an epithet i believe peculiar to himself  i now trust this explanation to the readers judgment and should also take leave of the subject itself were there not an expression in the last stanza the beauty of which is in a great measure lost for want of being rightly understood  i have not undertaken indeed to supply the defects of the commentators but as this song is a favorite i cannot proceed without making a slight animadversion or two on this head the expression i mean is though thou the waters warp the word warp has been very differently used by different writers it is used by some to mean contract or shrivel to turn aside etc and a certain lexicographer in his folio dictionary quotes this very line to show that it is used to express the effects of frost but may we not pertinently ask him what these effects are does he mean to say that shakespeare has used it here in a sense different from its most general and obvious meaning if he does he does not understand the poet if he does not he knows not how to write a dictionary to warp here means neither to contract nor to turn aside for the body of water in freezing is dilated not contracted and though the frost may arrest or stop water in its passage i dont know that it alters its course  the word waters indeed does not mean here as some have supposed water in the astract as a fluid in general it means also neither the waving multitudinous sea nor the rapid unfreezing rivers but such inland pools lakes and other stagnant or slowlymoving pieces of water that are subject to be affected by frost agreeable to this when the rivers break down or run over their banks laying the country under water we say the waters are out when the river is returned again to its channel also the pools remaining behind in the adjacent fields or meadows are called the waters    now it is well known that the surface of such waters as is here meant so long as they remain fluid i e unfrozen is apparently a perfect plane whereas when they are frozen this surface deviates from its exact flatness or warps this is peculiarly remarkable in small ponds the surface of which when frozen forms a regular concave the ice on the sides rising higher than that in the middle thus we see that shakespeare need not to be obliged to any lexicographer for admitting the latitude of his expression as he here uses the word warp in its primitive and most general signification to make a thing cast or bend as boards do when they are cut before they are thoroughly dry or when they are put to the fire  vol ii page    ros o most gentle jupiter  what tedious homily of love have you wearied your parishioners withal   dr warburton tells us we should read juniper as the followingwords show alluding to the proverbial term of a juniper lecture a sharp or unpleasing one juniper being a rough prickly plant  in answer to this dr johnson says in his usual indolent and laconic manner surely jupiter may stand  ay surely why not as well as jupiter in the beginning of the  th scene of the preceding act where the same rosalind says o jupiter how weary are my spirits yet neither he nor dr warburton boggle in the least at jupiter there but who told you dr johnson that jupiter might stand here and gave you the same reason for it  did not the author of the canons of criticism do this why should you be so sparing of confessing your obligations to that gentleman  vol ii page    ros i will be more jealous of thee than a barbary cockpigeon over his hen more clamorous than a parrot against rain more newfangled than an ape more giddy in my desires than a monkey i will weep for nothing like diana in the fountain and i will do that when you are disposed to be merry i will laugh like a hyen and that when you are inclined to sleep   dr warburton says that instead of the last word sleep we should read weep to this reading however dr johnson objects i know not says he why we should read to weep i believe must men would be more angry to have their sleep hindered than their grief interrupted  what our editor suggests is certainly very true especially of persons addicted to somnolency but if the poet intended the antithesis dr warburton seems to suppose i should rather read weep but then the construction of the sentence will not do instead of saying i will laugh like a hyen and that when you are inclined to weep the and should be transposed and the word that omitted he should have said and i will laugh like a hyen when you are inclined to weep supposing the text uncorrupted in no other particular i must give my voice with the editor for sleep but i cannot help suspecting that this passage is corrupted in a part where none of the commentators seem to think it it is justly to be presumed at least that dr johnson does not think it so as he passes it over notwithstanding he assures us in his preface that he has left not one passage that he thought obscure without attempting to elucidate it  but what shall we say to rosalinds laughing like a hyen if by a hyen is meant an hyaena i do not know what authority we have for its laughing nor can discover the propriety of the allusion it is reported indeed of that furious animal that it will counterfeit a mans voice nay call him by his name to entice him out of doors in order to devour him after which he may be said metaphorically to laugh in his sleeve at the success of his contrivance but the laughing here alluded to must be necessarily so loud as to prevent a drowsy mans going to sleep and i do not know that any animal in nature is possessed of the streperous part of risibility except man homo est animal risibile and i believe exclusively so shakespeare then can never mean to say like an hyaena  what then could he mean  true reader that is the question  have but a little patience and i will endeavor to tell you  shakespeare with all his diversity of action and character is generally very uniform and constant in his train of thinking he does not chop his metaphors into fritters nor skip giddily and alternately from the allusions of art to those of nature or vice versa the reader will please to observe that in the preceding line and in this very sentence he mentions diana now it is not at all like shakespeare to fly off immediately from this classical allusion to so distant a one as any afforded by natural history even supposing there were not that impropriety in it as i have above noticed  i would venture after the modish way of deciding arguments to lay a good bet if it could be determined that shakespeare wrote thus   i will weep for nothing like diana in the fountain and i will do that when you are disposed to be merry i will laugh like a hyad and that when you are inclined to sleep  the word laugh in the last part of the sentence being used by way of irony for cry thus we ironically say to laugh like heraclitus the weeping philosopher or according to the vulgar phrase to laugh on the wrong side of the mouth but if any of my readers should make objections to the supposed use of the figure abovementioned and be willing to look over the defect of construction in the text in favor of dr warburtons proposed alteration they may take the word in its natural sense in which case to laugh like a hyad would mean as another vulgar phrase has it to laugh till she cries in either case however it must be hyad and not hyen this latter reading being entirely excluded for the reasons above given by substituting the former also we make both the allusions classical and preserve that conformity of thinking which is perfectly agreeable to the genius of shakespeare who it is very possible came from reading ovid to compose many scenes in this play it is certain his head was so full of him that he mentions his very name in one of the scenes where neither the occasion nor the turn of the dialogue gave the least room for it i am here with thee and thy goats as the most capricious poet honest ovid was among the goths    so that to laugh like a hyad is to sob and blubber like one of the hyads now hyads or hyades is an appellation given to the constellation otherwise called the seven stars and suposed to be a watery sign whence their denomination from  i e to rain the poets feign these hyads to have been the daughters of atlas and aethra and pretend that hyas their brother having been torn to pieces by a lioness they wept so vehemently for his death that the gods in compassion to them translated them to heaven and placed them in the forehead of the bull where they still continue to weep whence the constellation is supposed by some to presage rain  i am well aware that some of my readers will think this comment written rather too much in the warburtonian strain it is not impossible also that some superficial critics may think that a man could not be kept awake by a womans weeping but certainly if she blubbered and roared heartily and out of spite as is here supposed he might as well be kept awake by her crying as her laughing besides if we reflect on the shrewd veracity of the old proverb that says women laugh when they can and weep when they will i conceive that rosalind in mentioning the several acts of her wilfulness speaks only of her weeping    but if it be just and pertinent i think this should be no objection to it for though dr warburtons comments on shakespeare are seldom to the purpose and therefore do not always deserve our approbation they are generally learned and never fail to excite our admiration either on account of their actual ingenuity or most palpable absurdity  vol ii page  0  epilogue if it be true that good wine needs no bush it is true that a good play needs no epilogue yet to good wine they do use good bushes and good plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues what a case am i in then that am neither a good epilogue nor can insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play here says dr johnson seems to be a chasm or some other depravation which destroys the sentiment here intended the reasoning probably stood thus good wine needs no bush good plays need no epilogue but bad wine requires a good bush and a bad play a good epilogue what case am i in then to restore the words is impossible all that can be done without copies is to note the fault  happy is it for the memory of shakespeare and as happy for his discerning readers that the veneration paid to his name sometimes prevents the hand of the commentator from executing those designs which his temerity conceives what work would not a critic of less modesty than our editor make of this passage should he take it in his head to supply what is thus supposed wanting yet how easily is the whole set right it can hardly be called a supposition that shakespeare wrote though instead of then that a transcriber might make such a mistake is also as likely as that he should write though for then as dr johnson supposes is done in king john page   0  it is obvious he must as he plays on the word good all through the passage not once introducing the epithet bad made use of by dr johnson nor hinting at the antithesis which the editor conceives so necessary to the sense though at the end of a sentence is commonly used in discourse for however and has the same meaning as but at the beginning of it thus it is the same thing as if the speaker had said but what a case am i in etc let the reader substitute these words for what a case am i in then and i dare say he will conceive with me there is no chasm in the passage but that it stands as shakespeare wrote it be this however as it may what is substituted by dr johnson is entirely foreign to the purpose it does by no means follow that because good wine needs no bush bad wine requires a good one good wine will recommend itself and sell without a bush but we do not thence infer that the goodness of any bush can recommend or sell bad wine  the bermudans i am told when they go fishing never trouble themselves to carry any oil or butter for sauce for if they catch a fat fish it requires none and if they catch a lean one it deserves none  shakespeare i fancy by saying nothing about either bad wine or bad plays reasoned about them both as the bermudans do about their fish  loves labor lost vol ii page     biron to the king study is like the heavens glorious sun that will not be searched with saucy looks small have continual plodders ever won save base authority from others books these earthly godfathers of heavens lights that give a name to every fixed star have no more profit of their shining nights than those that walk and wot not what they are too much to know is to know naught but fame and every godfather can give a name  king how well he is read to reason against reading  dr warburton and dr johnson having both exerted their critical abilities on this passage and as i think left it worse than they found it i shall insert the annotations of both as i find them printed in the pages before me  too much to know is to know naught but fame and every godfather can give a name the first line in this reading is absurd and impertinent there are two ways of setting it right the first is to read thus too much to know is to know naught but shame this makes a fine sense and alludes to adams fall which came from the inordinate passion of knowing too much the other way is to read and point it thus too much to know is to know naught but feign i e to feign as much as to say the affecting to know too much is the way to know nothing the sense in both these readings is equally good but with this difference if we read the first way the following line is impertinent and to save the correction we must judge it spurious if we read it the second way then the following line compleats the sense consequently the correction of feign is to be preferred to know too much says the speaker is to know nothing it is only feigning to know what we do not giving names for things without knowing their natures which is false knowledge and this was the peculiar defect of the peripatetic philosophy then in vogue these philosophers the poet with the highest humor and good sense calls the godfathers of nature who could only give things a name but had no manner of acquaintance with their essences  on the above annotation dr johnson observes that there being two ways of setting a passage right gives reason to suspect that there may be a third way better than either the first of these emendations makes a fine sense but will not unite with the next line the other makes a sense less fine and yet will not rhyme to the correspondent word i cannot see why the passage may not stand without disturbance the consequence says biron of too much knowledge is not any real solution of doubts but mere empty reputation in our editors appendix speaking of this passage he points reads and explains thus too much to know is to know naught but fame and every godfather can give a name that is too much knowledge gives only fame a name which every godfather can give likewise     the author of the revisal has a very long note on this passage rejecting the emendations proposed by dr warburton and seeming to coincide with the opinion of dr johnson his explanation of the passage is this too eager a pursuit of knowledge is rewarded not with the real possession of its object but only with the reputation of having attained it  it is really surprising to me that these several critics should be so much at a loss to comprehend what i conceive the context renders very plain without making any alteration in the text as it stood before dr warburton meddled with it viz too much to know is to know naught but fame and every godfather can give a name i cannot imagine what put it into the head of dr johnson or of the author of the revisal that fame here means reputation and supposing it does what can dr johnson mean by saying that too much knowledge gives only fame a name which every godfather can give likewise what because every godfather can call a child n or m is he able therefore to give him a literary reputation this puts me in mind of a certain french bookseller who speaking of the profession to which he intended to bring up an ignorant booby of a son bygar says he monsieur i will make him one author he shall be the first writer of the age morbleu he shall be une philosophe une voltaire    or is dr johnson so careless of his pointing as to mean to say that reputation is a mere name or farther how can to know naught but fame mean to acquire nothing but reputation be all this however as it may fame means here nothing more than report rumor or relation biron is declaiming against reading or the mere study of books little says he  have continual plodders ever won save base authority from others books the authors of which books he calls  earthly godfathers of heavens lights that give a name to every fixed star now continues he too much to know is to know naught but fame and every godfather can give a name to all which the king replies by observing to another nobleman how well biron is read  to reason against reading hence i think it is plain that biron means through the whole passage to inculcate a maxim which is undoubtedly a very true one viz that the greatest readers are not the most scientific the knowledge of things and of words being as different as the study of nature and the plodding over books from the latter people may acquire a heap of indigested literature without having any real knowledge at all indeed their too great attention to philological pursuits or to words often prevents their knowing any thing of philosophy or of things add to this that the knowledge acquired from books is for the most part founded on the authority of the writer and what is thus known is known only by report or relation so that those whose whole stock of knowledge consists in what they have read merely in the learned lumber of their memory may with great propriety be said to know nothing but what is told them that is to be entirely ignorant of facts and to know nothing but fame it would be absurd also to the last degree to say that to know too much would be to know nothing if no difference in the kind of knowledge was intended again the last line of birons speech evidently refers to what he had just before said concerning the base authority of books the authors can give names says he to things instancing those that give a name to every fixed star though they profit no more by them and know nothing farther about them than those who are ignorant of those names and this being all they can do he may well call their writings base authority and say that any body can do as much for  every godfather can give a name which is as much at least as astronomers do by the stars  the author of the revisal seems to think the word fame in this place has some reference to the kings speech at the commencement of the play when he proposes reputation as the principal aim and motive of their studies let fame that all hunt after in their lives live registered upon our brazen tombs and then grace us in the disgrace of death when spite of cormorant devouring time the endeavor of this present breath may buy that honor which shall bate his scythes keen edge and make us heirs of all eternity but admitting this i cannot see any reason to think that fame in the passage disputed has precisely the same meaning as in that just quoted unless both speeches had been spoken by the king  it is not unlikely that this passage refers to the fame recommended by the king but it is very unlikely that the speaker should affect to set a greater value on knowledge than on that fame which was at first proposed as the ultimate end to be attained by it  it is in my opinion more than probable that biron the speaker who is evidently a wit and rails at booklearning takes the advantage here of the equivocal use of the word fame to sneer at the kings proposing celebrity as the end of his studies in which case the contested line might be paraphrased thus to spend all your time in getting to know only the names of things and what others report about them is the way to get nothing else but fame sure enough indeed biron seems to be a man of such a kidney as to reason about literary fame as falstaff does about military honor and could easily resolve it in like manner by a trim reckoning into a very word air a mere empty report  vol ii page     cost the manner of it is i was taken in the manner  biron in what manner  cost in manner and form following  dr johnson tells us in his preface that when he inserts any of dr warburtons proposed emendations in the text he means to give them his highest approbation now this he has done in the present instance giving that scholiasts note likewise at the bottom of the page the note is as follows   taken with the manner the following question arising from these words shows we should read  taken in the manner and this was the phrase in use to signify taken in the fact so dr done in his letters but if i melt into melancholy while i write i shall be taken in the manner and i sit by one too tender to these impressions  the author of the canons of criticism however has invalidated what dr warburton advances in this place by another of his own notes on a passage in the first part of henry the fourth where the same expression occurs and on which the same reverend commentator says the quarto and folio read with the manner which is right taken with the manner is a law phrase and then in use to signify taken in the fact  mr edwards observed on remarking this inconsistency that great wits have short memories but i am at some loss to know to what i should impute dr johnsons giving the highest approbation to this blunder of dr warburtons that his memory is at least as bad and his attention full as little is evident from his quoting both these contradictory notes in their respective places and his giving the highest approbation to both the contradictory emendations by inserting them in the text one in the play before us and the other in that of henry iv notwithstanding the inconsistency had been pointed out in a book that has run through at least six editions to what can we impute such servile transcription shall we set it down among dr johnsons other concessions to the respect due to high place and his veneration for genius and learning or shall we rather impute it to his indolence in not consulting the canons of criticism  or perhaps he would neither choose to depend on the authority of that writer nor even on dr warburtons himself against the united suffrage of dr warburton and dr done he might have depended however on the farther authority of shakespeare which he might have had by turning over a few pages more of the volume before us the clown in the winters tale using the same phrase thus your worship had like to have given us one if you had not taken yourself with the manner  my readers will hardly doubt on this representation of the case that the common phrase was taken with the manner as to the certainty of its being adopted here however it may possibly be still disputed dr warburton says birons question immediately succeeding shows that costard should say in the manner for my part i cannot see the force of this reason though i can very well see why biron should not repeat with the manner because of another law phrase with which costard answers him viz in manner and form following now this could not be with any propriety with manner and form following but i think there is no impropriety in supposing that biron not attending to the quaintness of costards expression asks him simply and naturally in what manner notwithstanding costard had used the phrase with what manner be all this however as it may we have here a very flagrant instance in what manner dr johnson has commented on shakespeare and with what manners he has treated the public who encouraged him in this undertaking  vol ii page     moth a wonder master here is a costard broken in a shin   arm some enigma some riddle come  thy lenvoy  begin   cost no egma no riddle no lenvoy no salve in the male sir   dr johnson boggles here at the word male which he conjectures may stand for mail a packet or bag and thence the mountebanks budget the author of the revisal also supposes that we should read mail but he says that means no salve within the bandage he is equally silent however about the lenvoy the explanation of which though it be no great matter the english reader has been probably desirous of some little illustration or other    the matter indeed he owns is not great but one would wish he says for some meaning or other i wonder when he was in the humor to descend to such trifles he should pass over the word lenvoy which is so often repeated in this and the next page i dare say not one reader of shakespeare in a hundred and perhaps not all his commentators know very well what to make of it armado indeed is very explicit on the subject it is says he  an epilogue or discourse to make plain some obscure precedence that has to fore been sain i will example it now will i begin your moral and do you follow with my lenvoy the fox the ape and the humble be were still at odds being but three there is the moral now the lenvoy     all this is plain and intelligible enough every english reader also might learn from boyer that envoy meant the conclusion of a ballad or sonnet from which he might be led to mistake it for the mere burden of a song  but why should the couplets of a song or the explanation of an enigma be called the envoy the case was this  during the institution of the jeux floraux or poetical contests which formerly existed in france the sonnets or verses of the several candidates for the prize always closed with an address to the prince or umpire who determined their merit and to whom each was accordingly sent envoie whence the name and hence this part of the composition was usually the most studied and highly finished in order to induce the arbiter to bestow the prize on the author  vol ii page     the princess to a forester nay never paint me more where fair is not praise cannot mend the brow here  good my glass  take this for telling true  looking at her glass and giving the forester money to understand says our editor how the princess has her glass so ready at hand in a casual conversation it must be remembered that in those days it was the fashion among the french ladies to wear a lookingglass as mr bail coarsely represents it on their bellies that is to have a small mirror set in gold hanging at the girdle by which they occasionally viewed their faces or adjusted their hair  as mr johnson is almost always above referring particularly to his authorities i cannot readily turn to the passage in bail where he makes this coarse representation i am greatly apt to suspect however from the opinion i have of mons bayles usual propriety and elegance that our editor has mistaken his meaning it appears to me that if these mirrors were hanging at the girdle they would have been rather represented as worn at the side than on the belly as the watch and etui are at present add to this that if the ribbon or chain by which they were hung was so long as to permit the wearer to adjust her hair without taking it quite off as is reasonable to suppose it could hardly be suspended at the girdle for in that case such glasses would hang down to the knee and could not with any propriety be said to be worn on the belly i imagine therefore these mirrors were suspended from the neck or somehow fastened to the drapery covering the stomach and breast in which case mr bail might say without the least inelegance they were worn sur le ventre for i will venture to say it is from his using the word ventre on this occasion that dr johnson charges him with coarseness but ventre does not always signify the belly  the french distinguish between the stomach and belly by calling the former the petitventre or ventre superieur and the latter the basventre the general term is also frequently used instead of poitrine and as often means the stomach and breast as it does the belly  vaugelas will tell him also that the word ventre is used with great elegance in metaphorical writing thus passer sur le ventre a son ennemi is an approved phrase for giving an enemy a total defeat the french in like manner use the word entrailles in such phrases as literally translated would be very coarse and disgusting to an english ear to instance only one or two seigneur votre loi est graveee dans le fond de mes entrailles  les entrailles de la misericorde de dieu one of the most elegant french writers now living also calls the natural affection of a parent for his child lamour des entrailles but what should we think of an english critic who should translate such passages thus thy law o lord is engraven in our guts  the entrails of the mercy of god  the affection of the bowels  and thence take occasion to censure the writer for coarseness and inelegance  we are informed by some letters lately published in the st jamess chronicle and other newspapers as also the monthly magazines  that when dr johnson came to town about the year    0 he had a design of engaging in some translation from the french whether he ever did or no i cannot say but from this and some other specimens of his acquaintance with that language i cannot help thinking the author would have been extremely unlucky that had fallen into his hands  vol ii page     king so sweet a kiss the golden sun gives not to those fresh morning drops upon the rose as thy eyebeams when their fresh rays have smote the night of dew that on my cheeks down flows  on this passage dr johnson has the following note  the night of dew that on my cheeks down flows i cannot think the night of dew the true reading but know not what to offer  that is very strange dr johnson  why thou must have no more invention in thee than there is in a leaden plummet thy pegasus must be confined and hoodwinked like a horse in a mill or surely something would have suggested itself to a writer who declares that not a single passage in this whole work has appeared to him corrupt which he has not attempted to restore see dr johnsons preface  i would be far from seeking to depreciate the success of our editors modest industry see dr johnsons preface  but i am afraid the purchasers of his book will be apt to think from many such slovenly notes as this that both his industry and modesty are pretty well matched it is evident from the context that the king being over head and ears in love employs himself as people usually do in that situation wasting the livelong hours away in tears by night and sighs by day what objection then could our editor have to substituting nightly dew instead of night of dew if we are not absolutely certain the poet wrote so there is a moral presumption a great probability of it but whether he did or not the alteration is certainly an amendment and a very harmless one it would also have served a little to save the credit of the editor who whatever might be his intentions before he begun his work sufficiently shows by the work itself that he regarded not what he had promised when he did it and by his preface that he knew as little what he had done when it was finished  vol ii page   0 biron o me with what strict patience have i sat to see a king transformed to a knot  here indeed we see our editor attempting to restore a passage which appears to him corrupt  mark the success   to see a king transformed to a knot knot has no sense that can suit this place we may read sot the rhymes in this play are such as that sat and sot may be well enough admitted  what have you lost your hearing and judgment too mr editor as well as your memory and invention  do you not know that even sot and sot cannot be admitted into any verse as english rhymes and do you think the matter mended with sot and sat  besides do you see no impropriety in birons calling the king to his face a blockhood or fool because truly he was in love especially when he is conscious he is himself in the same situation add to this that so gross an expression is totally inconsistent with the fine strain of raillery that runs through the whole of his speech this attempt therefore of our editor at restoration is evidently a very unlucky one and is excusable only as the unsucessful endeavor of modest industry  but why does dr johnson conclude this passage to be corrupted if he thinks the rhymes sot and sat admissible surely he can have no objection to our pronouncing sat after the broad orthoepy of the vulgar in which case it would be a much less exceptionable rhyme to knot than what he is willing to admit  but he says knot has no sense that can suit this place he might have found however by turning to almost any dictionary excepting his own that a knot is a small bird well known in many parts of england and is called avis canuti by the naturalists as it is said because king canutus was very fond of such birds it is indeed a delicious kind of waterfowl now as biron has said but just before speaking of the king shot by heaven proceed sweet cupid thou have thumpt him with thy birdbolt under the left pap i cannot for my part see any objection to his comparing him in this passage to a wounded knot if my readers do i have done they will do me the justice however to own that if i am not possessed of dr johnsons ingenuity and modesty i show at least as much industry in defending the text of shakespeare as he does in pulling it to pieces  vol ii page     song when daizies pied and violets blue and ladysmocks all silver white and cuckowbuds of yellow hue do paint the meadows with delight dr warburton says we should read muchbedight which is very proper and elegant  the present editor quotes dr warburtons note to which he adds the following short animadversion  much less elegant than the present reading undoubtedly it is and i have here only to ask dr johnson why he excludes the notes of theobald when they have been sufficiently exploded by other writers and yet pesters his readers with those of dr warburton which stand exactly in the same predicament  the ingenious author of the canons of criticism objected long ago to this proposed emendation of dr warburtons judiciously observing that if bedight means bedecked or adorned the meadows being bedight already they little need painting  but dr johnson seems to be so much influenced by the respect due to high place that he seems determined to avoid the name of edwards as much as possible for fear of offending the bishop  the winters tale vol ii page     leontes you will  why happy man bes dole  that is says our editor may his dole or share in life be to be a happy man   it is doubtless true that dole means a share or part but if this be all the difficulty how is the sense elicited by dr johnson reconcilable to the literal construction of the sentence  the editor should have told his readers that happy man be his dole was a common proverbial phrase for wishing good luck either to ones self or others thus falstaff in the first part of henry the fourth now my masters happy man be his dole say i every man to his business  vol ii page     aut oh that ever i was born  cleon in the name of me   i believe me should be blotted out  here we have another article of dr johnsons critical creed it is certain that whether me be in or out is in this place of very little consequence but i so much revere the text of shakespeare that without i see an absolute necessity for it i will never defile it with a blot it seems as if the very name of johnson was fated to cast invidious reflections on that of shakespeare as if it was malignantly formed to absorb tho rays diffused by superior luster and enviously to fully with a reflected gloom the fountain of its own light  this scheme of blottingout was originally suggested by a johnson who when the players made their boast in honor of shakespeare that he never blotted out a line replied would he had blotted out a thousand this was ben johnson who only expressed his wish that shakespeare had done what sam johnson boldly determined to do for him for it is to be observed that here was no tenderness due to living reputation to stop his hand and he might think to indulge himself safely in the innocent discussion of a dead poets pretensions to renown see dr johnsons preface   if it be not owing to some such antipathy or inviduous influence subsisting between the names of johnson and shakespeare to what else can we impute dr johnsons objection to the harmless me in the above passage he very possibly cannot find any use for it but if we consider that the whole line is a mere exclamation testifying the clowns surprise at hearing autolicus cry out and seeing him lie grovelling on the earth had he said in the name of heaven  or in the name of mercy  the line however bordering on profanity would have past but nothing is more common than for conscientious people to check themselves in the middle of such exclamations or to substitute some innocent word in the place of the exceptionable one again if any objection be made to the supposition of the clowns stopping in the middle of the word mercy let us take another view of the exclamation and admit the word me to stand as a personal pronoun it is notorious that persons who as hotspur says swear like comfitmakers wives and give such sarcenet security for their oaths as in good sooth  as true as i live  as god shall mend me  and as sure as i live i say it is very common for these uncommon swearers who cannot gulp down or digest a good mouthfilling oath to protest upon their word now i cannot see why a person who to avoid a profane oath should protest upon his word might not with equal propriety in order to avoid a profane exclamation cry out in his name admitting this the clown instead of crying out in the name of heaven exclaimed in the name of himself viz l the name of me  and this expression may surely pass among expletives of this kind as well as for the soul of me  for the life of me  for the heart of me etc  after all whether i have convinced the reader or not of the propriety of letting me stand in the text i must have some better reason given me for expunging it than the ipsecredidit of a johnson  vol ii page     perdita  even now i tremble to think your father by some accident should pass this way as you did oh the fates how would he look to see his work so noble vilely bound up  here dr johnson has found shakespeare tripping again  hear what he says  his work so noble etc it is impossible for any man to rid his mind of his profession the authorship of shakespeare has supplied him with a metaphor which rather than he would lose it he has put with no great propriety into the mouth of a country maid thinking of his own works his mind passed naturally to the binder i am glad he has no hint at an editor  we have here also another awkward attempt of our editor at wit and pleasantry but why will thou dr johnson persist thus in playing at bobcherry when the prize hangs so high above thine head and such a weight of lead is incumbent on thy heels i have already advised thee in the fullness of my heart and as cicero says non otii abundantia sed amoris erga te not to be so forward to display thy wit i told thee before and i tell thee again thou have it not in thee being as unable to divert the reader with thy pleasantry as to convince him of shakespeares impropriety  again why dr johnson art thou glad that shakespeare has no hint at an editor do thou think he would have thrown out any censures that might reach thee  no  that incomparable bard was as thou say the poet of nature and drew his characters from the life and nature had not produced in that age so arrogant and at the same time so dull an animal as the present commentator on shakespeare there were pedants and pedagogues it is true in his day he has depicted an holofernes and a sir hugh evans but these were slight excrescences mushrooms champignons that perished as the smoke of the dunghill evaporated which reared them a modern editor of shakespeare is on the contrary a fungus attached to an oak a male agaric of the most astringent kind that while it disfigures its form may last for ages to disgrace the parent of its being  but to lay aside metaphor not burgerdischius gronovius nor any one of the whole tribe of dutch commentators from the first of them to the last has proceeded through his author with more phlegm and frigidity than dr johnson has gone through shakespeare and here lies the difference between dr warburton and dr johnson whose commentaries i place both on a footing with regard to their utility as they are themselves pretty equal with respect to that arrogance with which they have treated the public the living patrons of shakespeare in the commentary of dr warburton however we have all the fire and spirit of a restif imagination bridled in by as perverse an understanding whereas in that of dr johnson we see but too plainly the waywardness of senescence struggling with the weakness of puerility  it may be thought strange that i should treat dr johnsons pretensions to wit so contemptuously when it is notorious that his bonsmots have been constantly repeated for these ten years past in taverns and in coffeehouses at dinners and over teatables to the great gratification of his admirers and the edification of their hearers nay it is well known that a certain literary projector excited by the success of ben johnsons jests had schemed the publication of the johnsoniana under the name of our editor intending to insert on his title page instead of o rare ben o brave sam  but i know not how yet so it happened that upon enquiry the projector could not muster up above a dozen genuine jokes worth printing it was found that most of the wise sayings smart repartees pregnant puns and cramp conundrums imputed to him had been forged or invented for him by his friends and acquaintance the few following indeed were if i remember right admitted to be genuine  johnsoniana or the witty sayings of sam johnson m a  mr johnson being sent for by order of the king to write the history of the house of brunswick replied with great humor and loyalty to the gentleman who proposed it by saying what sir is there no scoundrel author in england but myself  mr johnson being offered a pension by his present majesty in return for the above instance of his loyalty he notwithstanding his former railing at placemen and pensioners very wittily and wisely said  nothing but growled and took it  mr johnson having on a necessary occasion turned himself toward the wall in one of the streets of oxford was reminded by his companion that he had indecently placed himself just opposite a window where some young ladies were drinking tea on which mr johnson p  f  g on wittily and delicately replied sir it is the office of nature and i shall discharge it  at another time mr johnson being in company where some persons were disputing about the doctrine of the trinity he rose up from his chair and ingeniously decided the dispute at once by clenching his fist and threatening to knock the first person down who in his presence should cast infidel reflections on his friend athanasius  in the same company he was also heard most divertingly to affirm that the man must be an atheist of the deepest dye who did not believe in the cocklane ghost  at various times and places he has been heard also to drop the following exquisite strokes of wit and humor  sir sir the fellow is a fool  sir the man is a blockhead  the rascal is an atheist  there are but three good lines in all churchills satires and two of them he stole from my london  shakespeare a poet sir he never wrote a line of poetry in his life an ostler sir a varlet that used to hold gentlemens horses at the playhouse  these and a few other strokes equally pointed and humorous being all the undertaker of the above project could pick up and as the humor even of these depended greatly on a certain motion of the head peculiar to dr johnson which cannot be committed to paper it was judged advisable to drop the scheme so that i hope i stand excused if i do not place dr johnsons witticisms among the anas or think him upon a sooting even with joe miller or his own namesake ben    it is hard to say indeed who is the dullest scholiast of the dullest writer of antiquity but dr johnson has the singular honor of being the dullest annotator on the brightest of all those who have succeeded the revival of letters  to return to dr johnsons annotation and the more particular defense of shakespeares text  the editor has here charged the poet with being guilty of an impropriety in making a country maid talk like an author but how does dr johnson know that this is really the case how does it appear from the words of the text that the allusion he charges on shakespeare is at all intended  that perdita could know nothing about bookbinding is taken for granted this being the very circumstance on which the charge of impropriety is founded but it does not appear notwithstanding dr johnson imputes this impropriety to shakespeares profession that the poet himself was much versed in the matter it is very little likely that a writer who confessedly took so little care about the printing of his works and has no hint at an editor should yet have his head so full of a bookbinder dr johnson is pleased for the honor i suppose of our profession to rank shakespeare among the liverymen of our company but though i honor my profession as being the most liberal of all others though i honor the immortal memory of shakespeare still more yet i respect the truth most of all it does not appear that the term authorship can be applied with any propriety to shakespeare for though he wrote for the stage i find no good authority for supposing he sold his copies or transferred his right in them to booksellers and he only is an author by profession who writes for the trade  no  to the honor of the gentlemen of the stage shakespeare was by profession a player and i have no better reason than his knowing every thing to suppose he knew that a bookbinder existed  to come now to verbal criticism a piece of work vilely bound up must according to dr johnson necessarily mean a book meanly bound but why so neither the words work nor bound up are idiomatical when applied to bookbinding in the first place we do not call the writings of an author his work but his works and though sometimes in speaking of the several sheets of a book or the different volumes of an authors works we may talk of binding them up yet speaking of a book in the singular number we talk always of its being bound merely not of its being bound up  on the other hand the term bind up is applicable to various works of husbandry and such kinds of employment as a country maid might well be supposed acquainted with add to this that the term bound up has a peculiar propriety in the passage before us as it is opposed to prankd up a few lines above the reader will remember that perdita the country maid is dressed like a princess or as she says most goddesslike prankd up and florizel the real prince is disguised in the habit of a clown now it is observable that as the superb dresses of the rich and gay were fastened together by ornamental brooches ouches knots of ribbons etc so the coarser garments of the poor and simple were fastened together and tied with strings or leathern thongs and hence perdita might very properly say that the prince in his swains wearing was vilely bound up without having any more allusion to the binding of a book than to the binding up of a wheatsheaf but because she has called the son the fathers work without any impropriety in the line before she must in this truly allude to bookbinding though were it so she must be guilty of as great an impropriety in the application of her allusion for why an author should be so terribly angry as she supposes at accidentally seeing his works meanly bound i cannot possibly devise as i conceive neither his interest nor his reputation can be at all affected by the difference between calves skin and sheeps leather  vol ii page     aut though i am not naturally honest i am so sometimes by chance  let me pocket up my pedlers excrement   how now rusticks whither are you bound   on this passage our editor gives the following laconic note   what he means by his pedlers excrement i know not no  then give me leave to tell you dr johnson you know too little or are much too indolent and inattentive to undertake a commentary on shakespeare  does not armado in loves labor lost page     of this very volume call his beard an excrement and do not you tell us in a note on that passage that the author has before called the beard valeurs excrement in the merchant of venice and should not the recollection of these passages not to mention others which an able commentator might have recollected have excited you to turn over this play a little in order to see whether some reason might not be found for supposing the word excrement to have here the same meaning  you may think indeed the futility of such a research evident on the face of the text as a man cannot easily put his beard in his pocket  very true but he does not call it his own beard but his pedlers beard for that character was assumed as was also the false beard he wore on that occasion in order the more to disguise himself lest he should be known again by the clown he had just before robbed act iv scene   it would have required no very acute or profound observation also to have remarked that though florizel in scene  0 stripped him of his pedlers clothes he had either no occasion for his beard or did not think it a false one this therefore autolycus had still on notwithstanding his change of habit till he found it necessary to speak to the clowns when prudently to appear in character he whipped it off and clapped it in his pocket saying let me pocket up my pedlers excrement  do you know now dr johnson or will you prudentially choose to remain still in ignorance shake your wise head and say as usual  sir sir the man who tells me this is a blackhead having written the above remarks on the pedlers excrement without turning to the editors increment the appendix to his eighth volume i was inclined to throw them aside on finding that the editor had found out or that somebody had told him the meaning of the word for he there says very laconically too page     pedlers excrement is pedlers beard but as he has not any where thought proper to let the reader into the secret of its being a fictitious beard or how otherwise autolicus could put it in his pocket i conceived some of my readers might profit by the above illustration and therefore determined to insert it and this the rather when i reflected that dr johnson could by no means lay a just claim to the merit of such information as he might acquire by publicly advertising for after his book was finished   vol ii page     shep my business sir is with the king   aut what advocate have thou to him   shep i know not ant like you   clo advocates the courtword for a pheasant say you have none   shep none sir i have no pheasant cock nor hen   advocates the court word for a pheasant this satire on the bribery of courts not unpleasant warburton  this satire or this pleasantry says dr johnson i confess myself not well to understand for my part i suspect but i will not be positive that the clown who seems to be the shrewdest of the two countrymen should say to the other advocates the courtword for a present meaning a gift or fee of some kind to which interpretation of the word he might possibly be led by some significant action of the pretended courtier whose design it evidently was to profit as much as possible by their ignorance on this supposition we see the shepherd is naturally led into the blunder of the pheasant which is otherwise not easily accounted for  twelfth night vol ii page   0 sir andrew  fair lady do you think you have fools in hand   marian sir i have not you by the hand   sir and marry but you shall have and here is my hand   mar now sir thought is free i pray you bring your hand to the buttery bar and let it drink   sir and wherefore sweetheart what is your metaphor   mar it is dry sir   sir and why i think so i am not such an ass but i can keep my hand dry but what is your jest   it is dry sir what is the jest of a dry hand i know not any better than sir andrew it may possibly mean a hand with no money in it or according to the rules of physiognomy she may intend to insinuate that it is not a lovers hand a moist hand being vulgarly accounted a sign of an amorous constitution  it must be confessed indeed that our editors sagacity is frequently at fault when a jest is in the wind the bringing the hand to the butterybar and letting it drink is a proverbial phrase among forward abigails to ask at once for a kiss and a present sir andrews slowness of comprehension in this particular gave her a just suspicion at once of his frigidity and avarice  she therefore calls his hand dry the moistness of the hand being a sign of liberality as well in matters of love as money thus othello to desdemona give me your hand this hand is moist my lady  this argues fruitfulness and liberal heart hot hot and moist    it is a good hand a frank one des you may indeed say so for twas hand that gave away my heart  oath a liberal hand   old foresight in love for love describes his wife also as having a mole upon her lip with a moist palm and an open liberality on the mount of venus  dr johnson need not therefore have expressed so much caution of suspecting this to be the truth of the matter there is one thing however he should have attended to and this is that the whole of this insinuation is founded rather on the rules of palmistry than physiognomy for though the etymology of the latter word be known to the learned who may admit of such latitude of expression i do not remember ever to have seen physiognomy made use of before by an english writer to signify any information of this kind but that which is acquired from the features of the face so that marians finding out any thing from st andrews palm by the rules of physiognomy must appear to an unlearned reader as absurd as if she had read his folly in his phyz by the rules of palmistry  to check the smile however of the unlearned reader and to preserve the veneration due to cramp words and crooked letters he is to know that phyz does not come from  but from a less ancient and honorable stock the french

think by the excellent constitution of thy leg it was formed under the star of a galliard   i know not how many or if all the editions authorize this reading of sinkapace our editor adopts it and passes it over in silence like the rest of the commentators i have ever looked upon it however as so vile a blot in this admirable piece of raillery of sir tobys that i cannot help imputing it to the interpolation of some transcriber who imagined there was an excellent joke in making water into a sinkapace the conceit however is so low and vile that i cannot give into the notion that shakespeare fond as he seems of punning and playing upon words was the author of it i am confirmed in this opinion also by reflecting that the attention of the reader is diverted from the real humor of the passage by this horrid conundrum sir toby in carrying his ridicule of poor aguecheeks dancingaccomplishments to the highest pitch proceeds so far as to tell him he would not stand still on the most necessary occasion even to make water but that he might not betray himself even to this fool by talking of absolute impossibilities he fixes on a grave flow and even hobbling kind of dance the cinquepace for this suspicious occasion the gravity and interruptions of this dance are indeed particularly pointed out by shakespeare on another occasion wooing wedding and repenting is a scotch jigg a measure and a cinquepace the first suit is hot and hasty like a scotch jigg and full as fantastical the wedding mannerly and modest as a measure full of state and gravity and then comes repentance and with his bad legs falls into the cinquepace     i could wish therefore the authority of the copies would bear me out in discarding this miserable pun and restoring the words to its genuine and original spelling  vol ii page     enter sir toby olivia by mine honor half drunk what is he at the gate uncle   sir toby a gentleman   olivia a gentleman what gentleman   sir toby it is a gentleman here  a plague othese pickle herring etc   dr warburton has a note on this passage which our editor has inserted without any animadversion notwithstanding it has been sufficiently exposed and confuted by mr edwards as dr johnson appears to think by the pointing he has adopted in the text which is different both from that of warburton and theobald theobald points and reads thus sir toby it is a gentleman here  belches a plague othese pickle herring   dr warburtons note runs thus  it is a gentleman here   he had before said it was a gentleman he was asked what gentleman and he makes this reply which it is plain is corrupt and should be read thus it is a gentlemanheir i e some ladys eldest son just come out of the nursery for this was the appearance viola made in mens clothes  on this note mr edwards observes that gentlemanheir is a new and unnecessary phrase for a ladys eldest son concluding that shakespeare has no need of it as any body will own who considers that sir toby was drunk and interrupted in his speech by his pickled herrings that is by the pickled herrings he had been eating and which rising in his stomach occasioned him to belch as theobald has it  is it possible after all this to guess what induced our editor to trouble his readers with dr warburtons frivolous note and to adopt mr edwardss pointing against that of theobald without mentioning a word of either of the two latter  the merry wives of windsor vol ii page     nym for the revolt of mien is dangerous   the revolt of mien says dr johnson i suppose we may read the revolt of men sir t hanmer reads this revolt of mine either may serve for the present text i can find no meaning  why then did you adopt it the author of the revisal affirms that this revolt of mine is the common reading as appears from mr popes edition and is plainly alluded to in pistols reply thou art the mars of malcontents the reviser charges both dr warburton and mr theobald also with having taken here an unwarrantable liberty with the text without giving the least hint to the reader of what they had done  yet notwithstanding all this our editor has admitted a futile note on this passage by mr steevens into his appendix in which that gentleman unsuccessfully endeavors as dr johnson says on another occasion to elicit sense by strong agitation out of the text as it now stands  vol ii page     mrs page i warrant he has a thousand of these letters writ with blankspace for different names nay more and thee are of the second edition he will print them out of doubt for he cares not what he puts into the press when he would put us two   having charged dr johnson among the other editors of shakespeare with passing over difficult passages and displaying their sagacity on those which are obvious i cannot pass over an instance of the latter kind on the passage before me our editor makes the following note referred to from the word press  press is used ambiguously for a press to print and a press to squeeze  the reader would certainly stand in need of a ghost to to come from the dead to tell him this and yet dr johnson when it was necessary to apologize for having done less than he ought could plead that the reader is seldom pleased to find his opinion anticipated and that it is natural to delight more in what we find or make than in what we receive  vol ii page     nym  i have a sword and it shall bite upon my necessity   dr warburton has a mighty whimsical note on this passage which our editor has printed though he condemns it and has silently adopted the reading of mr edwards who had sufficiently exposed the absurdity of the warburtonian emendation see canons of criticism page      vol ii page     host  will you go anheirs   dr warburtons note on this passage printed without any animadversion of our editor runs thus  will you go an heirs this nonsense is spoken to shallow we should read will you go on heris i e will you go on master heris an old scotch word for master  what the present editor understands by this word or whether he understands any thing by it is not easily determined as he has thought proper to leave it in this situation doubtless for the reason given above viz its being natural for the reader to delight more in what he may find out of himself than what the scholiast may tell him for my part however i apprehend the mere english reader would be glad of some little assistance here especially as dr johnson does not seem to be satisfied with dr warburtons note  the author of the revisal appears also to be of the same opinion and therefore has given his readers the following remarks on this controverted passage will you go on heris the nonsense of the former editions was will you go an heirs mr warburton assures us  heris is an old scotch word for master it may be so for ought i know but as my experience has taught me some distrust of this gentlemans positive assertions in matters of this nature i must beg leave to doubt of it besides this word according to this interpetation of it is of the singular number and yet is addressed not to ford but to page and shallow as is evident from what immediately follows i see no reason neither why either shakespeare or mine host of the garter should choose to talk old scotch and therefore i should rather suppose our poet might have written will you go on hearts an expression suited to the jovial character of mine host and not very different in appearance from the common reading especially when spelled as it anciently was herts mr theobalds conjectures will you go on here or will you go mynheirs carry with them in my opinion very little probability  it is very justly observed by the reviser that there is no obvious reason for mine host of the garter to speak old scotch but if we consider that he is a german i do not see why the scholiast should suppose theobalds last emendation improbable nothing is more likely i think than for him now and then to drop a word of high or low dutch it is true that the word mynheirs is properly neither one nor the other for neither the dutch nor the german make the plural of here or herr end in s add to this that they seldom use the personal pronoun singular with the noun plural when they accost a single person with the title of my lord or sir it is mynheer or mein herr but when they address more than one with the title of lords or gentlemen the pronoun is generally dropped and they say heeren or herren  but i see no manner of impropriety in supposing our host to be either above or below such idiomatical and grammatical niceties in which case he might not only join the singular pronoun with the plural noun as the english say my lords as well as my lord but also give the plural noun their common ending in english so that if theobald had substituted mynheers it might have pasted but if it be insisted on that our host of the garter shall speak properly and elegantly the passage must stand thus will you go on heeren or herren the reader may take which he likes best both meaning simply will you go on gentlemen   i cannot help referring on this occasion to a passage in our editors preface where among other excuses for doing so little after having promised so much he has the following curious passage  if my readings are of little value they have not been ostentatiously displayed or importunately obtruded i could have written longer notes for the art of writing notes is not of difficult attainment the work is performed first by railing at the stupidity negligence ignorance and asinine tastelessness of the former editors and showing from all that goes before and all that follows the inelegance and absurdity of the old reading then by proposing something which to superficial readers would seem specious but which the editor rejects with indignation then by producing the true reading with a long paraphrase and concluding with loud dr johnson is here expressly describing the method of writing annotations pray doctor is your pen any thing like a speaking trumpet a stentorophontick instrument as your dictionary more explicitly calls it if it be not i cannot for the soul of me conceive how you do to write loud as to my goosequill it runs over the paper as still as a mouse but then it is true i cannot boast that my writings have made so much noise in the world as those of dr johnson   acclamations on the discovery and a sober with for the advancement and prosperity of genuine criticism  we see here that dr johnson knew very well what was to be done if he had but had abilities industry or goodwill will enough to do it indeed he has sometimes succeeded pretty well in doing all that he has here described except in one little particular and that is producing the true reading this he has done so very seldom that we could very readily have excused him if he had displayed even more ostentation had he given us but a proportionate quantity more of truth  vol ii page     ford though page be a secure fool and stand so firmly on his wifes fealty yet i cannot put off my opinion so easily   all the copies says dr warburton read stand so firmly on his wifes frailty but to this reading mr theobald objected no surely page stood tightly to the opinion of her honesty and would not entertain a thought of her being frail i have therefore ventured to substitute a word correspondent to the sense required and one which our poet frequently uses to signify conjugal fidelity  in reply to this note dr warburton says mr theobald has no conception how any man could stand firmly on his wifes frailty and why because he had no conception how he could stand upon it without knowing what it was but if i tell a stranger that the bridge he is about to cross is rotten and he believes it not but will go on may i not say when i see him upon it that he stands firmly on a rotten plank yet he has changed frailty for fealty and the oxford editor has followed him but they took the phrase to stand firmly on to signify to insist upon whereas it signifies to rest upon which the character of a secure fool given to him shows so that the common reading has an elegance that would be lost in the alteration  notwithstanding this fine reasoning however of dr warburton the present editor has judiciously stuck by theobalds emendation in the text though he is perfectly silent about it in his notes it happens nevertheless very unluckily for dr johnson that he has quoted this very passage in his dictionary under the word frailty as an authority for the use and meaning of that word but of this i shall take proper notice in my table of errata a work in great forwardness for the press designed for the use of the purchasers of that celebrated performance and intended shortly to be published under the title of a ramble through the idlers dictionary   to that admired and truly wonderful lexicon the blunders of which i hope god willing to get through some time or other although it is such an augean stable as requires to cleanse it properly the application and abilities of an hercules  vol ii page   0 fall  they would melt me out of my sat drop by drop and liquor fishermens boats with me   for boats we should read boots this may probably be an error in the printer but editors as i have observed before whose task professedly lies in regulating points and adjusting true readings are answerable for every slip of this kind whereby the meaning of their author is obscured or misrepresented  vol ii page     ford heaven be praised for my jealousy  eleven oclock the hour  i will prevent this detect my wife be revenged on falstaff and laugh at page i will about it  better three hours too soon than a minute too late    in a note on this passage our editor has displayed his critical acumen most egregiously as indeed most of shakespeares editors do when they venture an inch beyond the servile bounds of verbal criticism our poet is universally allowed to be one of the greatest masters in describing the effects as well as the greatest judge of the operation of the passions that ever existed and yet is he here arraigned for an error which affects him as an accurate observer of human nature and a just delineator of the actions of mankind his most distinguishing characteristics the note here follows  eleven oclock ford should rather have said ten oclock the time was between ten and eleven and his impatient suspicion was not likely to stay beyond the time  no dr johnson  ford should neither be made to say ten nor eleven oclock he is not speaking of the time at which falstaff is to meet his wife but of the time then present which is seven oclock just three hours as he expressly observes from the earliest time of the appointment so that so far is his impatient suspicion from staying beyond the time of their intended meeting that it seems to urge him instantly to go about to defeat the supposed purposes of it  i will about it  better three hours too soon than a minute too late  why should he particularly mention three hours rather than any indefinite time unless for the reason given i know not how far the copies may authorize this reading but the mistake might easily be made by the first transcribers and be successively transmitted through the press uncorrected as the sense was not very palpably affected by it by reading seven for eleven however we deliver shakespeare from the persecution of his annotator and give a beauty and propriety to the passage which at present is doubtless exceptionable i would advise the actor also who may perform this part for the future to look at his watch when he repeats this sentence for that was evidently the authors intention as appears by the intimation of his having still three hours good in which to take proper measures to surprise the parties he did not mean as is plain by the sequel to prevent or hinder their meeting but to be beforehand the word prevent being here used perhaps nearly though not altogether in the same sense s in our liturgy when we say o lord prevent us in all our doings it may indeed be conceived to carry a double meaning viz fords simply getting the start of the parties in order to detect and expose them or as is above hinted to prevent or hinder his being made a cuckold but i think he seems to so be well assured of his having been cuckolded by somebody or other that a single prevention of this kind could be of little consideration with him it were indeed to little purpose if his opinion of his wife were justly founded and his sarcasm on the sex in general were true i e that what they think in their hearts they may effect they will break their hearts but they will effect   with them in the means of detection add to all this that although in his rage he says just before the hour is fixed yet no one particular hour was precisely named for the intended rendezvous it was not at ten nor at eleven but between ten and eleven so that the reason dr johnson gives why he should not say eleven is in itself sufficient to prove he should say neither  the taming of the shrew vol iii page  0 tranio if love has touched you naught remains but so redime te captum quam queas minimo  dr warburton tells us that the line here quoted from terence shows that we should read in the preceding if love has toiled you  i e taken you in his toils his nets alluding to the capius est habet of the same author  dr johnson however without even deigning to adopt not that dr warburtons emendation is defensible but is sufficiently refuted by mr edwards see canons of criticism page     any thing that might do the least honor to shakespeares learning takes upon him boldly to assure us that our author had this line from lilly which i mention says he that it may not be brought as an argument of his learning  but pray dr johnson how can you take upon you to say that shakespeare had this line from lilly and not from terence is it because the line is to be found in lilly and is this your whole authority  you can have no other it appears by the application however that shakespeare knew the meaning of this line and if he knew it in lilly why might he not know it in the original author from whom it was taken is it because you have so often quoted words and passages in languages you do not understand that you suspect shakespeare of a similar practice you should never measure others corn by your own bushel you have been already reprehended in public for misrepresenting in your preface the testimony of your predecessor ben johnson who tells us that shakespeare had small latin and less greek this you converted into small latin and no greek the ingenious critic who reminded you of this error was candid enough to impute it to your quoting from memory only in the st jamess chronicle  but supposing that in this case such a method of quotation was excusable it appears i think too plainly from your constant and repeated endeavors to depreciate both the natural and acquired abilities of shakespeare that this was not the case your perseverance in these endeavors at least give great reason to suspect the mistake was wilful as the supposition of his having any greek at all would not have suited with your darling project or answered your end of invidiously representing him as a varlet one of the illiterate vulgar  vol iii page    pet such wind as scatters young men through the world to seek their fortunes farther than at home where small experience grows but in a few signior hortensio thus it stands with me  dr warburton says this nonsense should be read thus where small experience grows but in a mew i e a confinement at home and the meaning is that no improvement is to be expected of those who never look out of doors  to this note quoted from dr warburton the present editor adds the following  why this should seem nonsense i cannot perceive in a few means the same as in short in few words  this piece of information however and the method of pointing adopted by dr johnson might have been had long ago from mr edwards canons of criticism who in exposing the absurdity of dr warburtons emendation quotes other passages from shakespeare where the same expression is made use of  in few his death whose spirit lent a fire even to the dullest peasant in his camp etc second part of henry iv again in henry v thus then in few   vol iii page    gremio two thousand ducats by the year of land my land amounts but to so much in all  all the copies it seems concurred in reading my land amounts not to so much in all but because dr warburton blunderingly conceived something must be wrong in it and wrote a plausible note in justification of but dr johnson has not only inserted the said tedious note but has given his highest approbation to the proposed emendation by adopting it in the text  the sensible author of the revisal however having exposed the futility of the alteration and sufficiently explained the text agreeable to the old reading dr johnson has thought proper in his appendix to recant his former opinion a glaring instance this among many others of the little pains our editor took to examine into these matters himself  much ado about nothing vol iii page     mess i see lady the gentleman is not in your books    the gentleman is not in your books this is a phrase used i believe by more than understand it  good lack what a sad thing it is to want dr johnsons understanding you understand it no doubt doctor  oh yes i see you tell us what it is  to be in ones books is to be in ones codiciis or will to be among friends set down for legacies  but among friends now doctor how do you know this i know that in your dictionary by way of proving that to be in books as you vaguely term it means to be held in kind remembrance you quote the following passage from addison i was so much in his books that at his decease he left me the lamp by which he used to write his lucubrations  but do you merely because the phrase is illustrated by this passage insist upon the phrase being literally applicable to the illustration or have you a better reason faith i am apt to suspect not for surely uncommunicative as you are you would have told it us either in your dictionary or in your edition of shakespeare  shall i tell you then what i conceive to be the origin of this phrase not that i pertinaciously insist upon being in the right because i think dr johnson is in the wrong i have a mind to indulge myself however in a conjecture if it so prove on this occasion  it was an ancient custom among the literati all over europe and is still kept up abroad particularly in holland and germany for men of letters to keep a book which they call an album so denominated from a similar application of that word among the ancient romans to a matricular register or musterroll of names this book or books contained in like manner a list of the names of the owners friends admirers or acquaintance who in subscribing their names in his album generally used to preface them with some compliment or device in prose or verse each after his own manner it was very natural therefore for them to say in speaking of their favorites or friends that they were in their books and of their enemies that they were not in their books or out of their books nay i know not if it would be at all unnatural for resentful persons to strike out the names of those who might afterward offend them in order to show their spleen and at the same time that they would not be obliged to such people for a compliment i cannot help thinking also that i discover a propriety in the messengers using this phrase to beatrice as he might intend sarcastically to insinuate that he imagined by the severity of her raillery against benedict that he was one who had paid no compliment to her beauty but whether this propriety be imaginary or not there is not the least room for supposing that he meant to say beatrice had not according to dr johnsons explication remembered benedict in the codicil of her will it is indeed a thousand to one if the last will and testament of the buxom beatrice was written and a much greater chance if it had codicils annexed to it  vol iii page     beat good lord for alliance  thus goes every one to the world but i and i am sunburnd i may sit in a corner and cry heighho for a husband   dr johnsons note what is it to go to the world perhaps to enter by marriage into a settled state but why is the unmarried lady sunburned i believe we should read thus goes every one to the wood but i and i am sunburned thus does every one but i find a shelter and i am left exposed to wind and sun the nearest way to the wood is a phrase for the readiest means to any end it is said of a a woman who accepts a worse match than those which she had refused that she has passed through the wood and at last taken a crooked stick but conjectural criticism has always something to abate its confidence shakespeare in all is well that ends well uses the phrase to go to the world for marriage so that my emendation depends only on the opposition of wood to sunburned  a very slight dependence indeed and by no means worthy so prolix an illustration our editor surely had lost himself in a wood or his wits were gone woolgathering about the hedges while he penned it  to go to the world is to go into to settle in the world which is usually supposed to be done in marriage thus the clown in all is well that ends well asks the countess leave to marry isabel  if i have your ladyships good will to go to the world isabel the woman and i will do as we may  that a wood was necessary to give meaning to the word sunburned i cannot admit it is evident that beatrice here speaks ironically and perhaps a little sarcastically and peerishly on the occasion of heros getting a husband before her for it seems that hero was a brunette and in all probability not so fair nor so fine a woman as beatrice at least so it is if we may take signior benedicts word for it who speaking of hero says she is too low for an high praise too brown for a fair praise and too little for a great praise whereas of her cousin beatrice he speaks in a different manner and this even before he is tricked into falling in love with her and while he boasts that he can see without spectacles of her he says after turning up his nose as it were at the commendations given to the person of hero there is her cousin if she were not possessed with such a fury exceeds her as much in beauty as the first of may does the last of december now though we should suppose benedict to be a little partial as having a sneaking kindness though he will not own it for this amiable fury yet it seems clear that she was fairer than hero it was very natural for her therefore to say ironically on this occasion thus every one gets married but i  poor i am sunburnd i e not fair enough to attract the notice of the men but must sit in a corner and cry heighho for a husband  vol iii page     been how now interjections why then some be of laughing as ha ha he   this passage says our editor is a quotation from the accidence doubtless to remind us that shakespeares learning did not reach higher than lillys grammar of which he had before taken notice or perhaps to sink the same of his erudition if possible still lower and to level it with that of tailor the waterpoet who having read from possum to posset there made a stop and could not farther get   vol iii page     claudio o hero what a hero had thou been if half thy outward graces had been placed about the thoughts and counsels of thy heart  i am afraid says our editor here is intended a poor conceit upon the word hero  did thou really express thy fears or thy hopes dr johnson on this occasion did you not mean to express by this suggestion rather what you would have the reader believe than what you yourself actually believed to be true  you will ask me in your turn probably what right i have to catechize you  it is very true i am too young a catechiser to question in general such a veteran of a catechumen but i have undertaken the cause of shakespeare and must tell you it carries with it a very invidious appearance and is by no means candid to insinuate any charge against him couched in whatever terms you please that you cannot prove to be true for my part i shall think shakespeare always innocent till i can prove him guilty and it had better become you as his editor to have done so too and not to have clothed thus your injurious suspicions in the specious garb of tenderness and friendship  out with such halffaced fellowship  all is well that ends well vol iii page     par  here comes the king  laf lustick as the dutchman says  it is whimsical enough that our editor who thinks it necessary even in this very volume to inform his readers that ostentation means show appearance etc that port signifies look demeanor carriage etc that to broke with is to deal like brokers with many other curious and learned pieces of information of equal difficulty and importance should be as totally silent as the rest of the commentators about the meaning of the word lustick supposing he had not understood the meaning of it himself could he have turned to none of the old nederduitschen woordenboeken that furnished him with etymologies for his dictionary some of them i warrant him would have told him that lustig signifies hearty cheerful etc and is aptly spoken by lafeu at seeing the king so well restored to his health and able as he expresses it to lead his female doctress a corranto  our commentators here put me in mind of the scotch peddler who turning pedagogue was now and then puzzled at his pupils boggling at a hard word on which occasion he would always peevishly cry out the deel tak their laytin and grik skip it bearn skip it  vol iii page     king where great addition swells and virtue none it is a dropsied honor good alone is good without a name vileness is so the property by what it is should go not by the title  dr warburton condemns the text here and says it is corrupted into nonsense he then gives us as usual some worse nonsense of his own and dr johnson as usual inserts his annotation confessing that he has himself nothing or very little better than nothing to offer  the former scholiast proceeds thus  good alone is good without a name vileness is so   the text is here corrupted into nonsense we should read  good alone is good and with a name vileness is so i e good is good though there be no addition of title and vileness is vileness though there be the oxford editor understanding nothing of this strikes out vileness and puts in its place intself  dr johnson says the present reading is certainly wrong and to confess the truth i do not think dr warburtons emendation right yet i have nothing that i can propose with much confidence of all the conjectures that i can make that which least displeases me is this  virtue alone is good without a name helen is so the rest follows easily by this change  the author of the revisal seems to understand the passage better than either of the doctorial critics just mentioned he tells us the common reading is  good alone is good without a name vileness is so the meaning of which says he one would imagine should be pretty plain good singly by itself without the addition of title is good still it is the same thing with vileness it takes its nature from itself and not from external circumstances as title and the like and this interpretation is given by the poet himself in the lines immediately following the property by what it is should go not by the title notwithstanding all this mr warburton mistook the meaning and then murdered the text  as to dr johnsons conjectural emendation it serves to no other purpose than to betray how barren he is at conjectures i conceive nevertheless that our editor has restored the true pointing though it differs from that of his rival scholiast but whether this be due to cunning or good luck i cannot pretend to say unless i knew to whom to attribute the honor of correcting the press the editor or the printer the meaning i think is obvious and the passage may be paraphrased thus good by itself is good and even so if unadorned by titles vileness were vileness  i do not propose this improvement of the revisers explanation with any great confidence nor merely for the sake of differing from that very sensible writer but because i think there is some little tautology in saying good by itself is good and then to add without a name for certainly if it was by itself alone it was without any thing else  vol iii page   0 bertram  war is no strife to the dark house and the detested wife  to the dark house   the dark house is a house made gloomy by discontent milton says of death and the king of hell preparing to combat so frowned the mighty combatants that hell grew darker at their frown johnson  i know not how this quotation from milton illustrates the text unless we are to suppose that bertram or shakespeare had read milton or unless our editor meant to justify the poetry of shakespeare by the authority of milton but not to insist on shakespeares standing in no need of such suffrage the allusion of darkness to the gloom of discontent would be unexceptionable even in the meanest of our minor poets the whole line however has in my opinion only a general allusion to the common saying of a smoky house and a scolding wife which with a little alteration and still preserving an alliteration bertram converted to use on the present occasion  vol iii page     helena look on this letter madam here is my passport  when thou can get the ring upon my finger which never shall come off and show me a child begotten of thy body that i am father to then call me husband but in such a then i write a never    the commentators seem to be sadly puzzled to explain this letter the meaning of which could not possibly be mistaken by any one who should read the play quite through dr warburtons note runs thus  when thou can get the ring upon my finger i e when thou can get the ring which is on my finger into thy possession the oxford editor who took it the other way to signify when thou can get it on upon my finger very sagaciously alters it to when thou can get the ring from my finger  dr warburtons explanation is undoubtedly as well founded as the oxford editors is strange and inconsistent dr johnson indeed says that he thinks dr warburtons explanation sufficient but continues he i once read it thus when thou can get the ring upon thy finger which never shall come off mine  will the reader believe me when i tell him after this that the meaning of the passage in dispute is not only ascertained by the plot of the play as above hinted but is also expressed in the last act by words that admit of no equivocation yet so it is helena in the last scene producing the letter and addressing bertram in these words  there is your ring and look you here is your letter this it says when from my finger you can get this ring and are by me with child etc this is done will you be mine now you are doubly won   if scholiasts would but make themselves masters of the text before they sit down to write comments on it they would be saved a world of trouble in puzzle and conjecture it is true they would not have such frequent opportunities of displaying their ingenuity but then they would frequently avoid falling into absurdity so that as our editor observes on another occasion they would gain on one side what they lose on the other for as merry andrew critically remarks of his dancing pigs what they now get by footing and casting off they lose by setting corners and turning round  vol iii page     helena  o you leaden messengers that ride upon the violent speed of fire fly with false aim move the stillpiercing air that sings with piercing do not touch my lord  dr warburton to whom dr johnson sticks like one of the conjurors familiars to the skirts of trappolin says the words are here oddly shuffled into nonsense we should read says he  pierce the stillmoving air that sings with piercing  i e pierce the air which is in perpetual motion and suffers no injury by piercing  to this dr johnson adds nothing on the page before us but tells us in his appendix that for piercing air we should read piecing air  this piecing air it is true is very much of a piece with the rest of our editors annotations but what he means by it i cannot conceive any more than i can find out what dr warburton means by the perpetual motion of the air which prevents it from being injured by piercing in my opinion however the meaning of shakespeare in this passage is obvious it is notorious that the epithet stillpiercing or silentlypiercing is applicable to the air on more occasions than one a cold air is a piercing air and indeed whether the air be cold or hot it silently pierces or penetrates into the inmost recesses of place and even the pores of many apparently solid bodies it is likewise notorious that a cannon or musketball whizzes or whistles as it passes through or pierces the air which being converted poetica licentia from the patient to the agent and vice versa may with great propriety be said to sing with piercing i e with being pierced though it pierces silently itself and thus we see evidently the antithesis intended by the poet which has escaped the penetrating looks and piercing eyes of his commentators  vol iii page     ber i was compelled to her but i love thee by loves own sweet constraint and will for ever do thee all rights of service  dia ay so you serve us till we serve you but

ber change it change it be not so holycruel love is holy etc  i judged it expedient to make so large a quotation from the text in order that the reader might form some judgment of his own before he entered on the perplexing annotations to which two or three of the above lines have given rise  dr warburtons note as quoted by dr johnson is as follows  what is not holy that we swear not by yes nothing is more common than such kind of oaths but diana is not here accusing bertram for swearing by a being not holy but for swearing to an unholy purpose as is evident from the preceding lines it is not the many oaths that make the truth but the plain single vow that is vowed true the line in question therefore is evidently corrupt and should be read thus what is not holy that we swear not bides i e if we swear to an unholy purpose the oath abides not but is dissolved in the making this is an answer to the purpose she subjoins the reason two or three lines after  this has no holding to swear by him whom i protest to love that i will work against him i e that oath can never hold whose subject is to offend and displease that being whom i profess in the act of swearing by him to love and reverence  what may have misled the editors into the common reading was perhaps mistaking bertrams words above by loves own sweet constraint to be an oath whereas it only signifies being constrained by love  this note of dr warburtons the argument of which is as false as the emendation proposed is constrained and uncouth is highly commended by the present editor his annotation is as follows  this is an acute and excellent conjecture and i have done it the due honor of exalting it to the text yet methinks there is something yet wanting the following words but take the highest to witness even though it be understood as an anticipation or assumption in this sense  but now suppose that you take the highest to witness  has not sufficient relation to the antecedent sentence i will propose a reading nearer to the surface and let it take its chance ber how have i sworn  dia it is not the many oaths that make the truth but the plain single vow that is vowed true  ber what is not holy that we swear not by but take the highest to witness  dia then pray tell me if i should swear etc  bertram means to enfore his suit by telling her that he has bound himself to her not by the petty protestations usual among lovers but by vows of greater solemnity she then makes a proper and rational reply  again dr johnson conceives another part of the above quotation to be corrupt which as it may something affect the sense of the whole i choose to take notice of here although the editor considers it in a distinct note  to swear by him whom i protest to love that i will work against him this passage likewise appears to me corrupt she swears not by him whom she loves but by jupiter i believe we may read to swear to him there is says she no holding no consistency in swearing to one that i love him when i swear it only to injure him  but farther dr johnson on reconsidering this passage tells us in his appendix that in the print of the old folio it is doubtful whether it is joves or loves the characters being not distinguishable if it is read loves perhaps it may be something less difficult i am still at a loss  and so by this time i presume is the reader but as the poet says who shall decide when doctors disagree doubtless nobody less than he that has been dubbed or capt twice and he may authoritatively plead the same right of preeminence over a single graduate as two marrowpuddings have prerogatively over one i hope none of the learned doctors of oxford cambridge or dublin nor even those of edinburgh glascow or lambeth will be offended at the vulgarity of this comparison had they been invested however with their doctorial dignities at rheims louvain or harderwyk they would readily see into the propriety of comparing a diploma to a marrowpudding it is indeed a choice simile but i cannot now tarry to illustrate it     how far the author of the revisal may be qualified to determine this matter i cannot pretend to say being to my regret utterly unacquainted with the name and quality of that writer but as i think he has explained this passage better than either of the graduated gentlemen above quoted i shall not follow dr johnsons example by clothing his sentiments in different words and passing them off as my own  the revisers remarks on the passage in question are as follow what is not holy that we swear not bides  but take the highest to witness   mr warburton has so strangely puzzled himself about this passage that he has at last quite lost sight of its drift and purpose and given us one of the most elaborate pieces of nonsense to be found in his whole performance the common reading however what is not holy that we swear not by but take the highest to witness is if he could have been content with it extremely plain and clear the sense is we never swear by what is not holy but swear by or take to witness the highest the divinity the tenor of the reasoning contained in the following lines perfectly corresponds with this if i should swear by joves great attributes that i loved you dearly would you believe my oaths when you found by experience that i loved you ill and was endeavoring to gain credit with you in order to reduce you to your ruin no surely but you would conclude that i had no faith either in jove or his attributes and that my oaths were mere words of course for that oath can certainly have no tie upon us which we swear by him we profess to love and honor when at the same time we give the strongest proof of our disbelief in him by pursuing a course which we know will offend and dishonor him   the reviser is here very near the truth but has neither fully confuted dr warburton nor prevented the difficulties suggested by dr johnson he is also mistaken in supposing the words this has no holding to mean such an oath is not binding since be other matters as they may nothing i think is plainer than that she means as dr johnson says there is no consistency and this explanation of those words though it be our editors own is what militates against the alteration of by into to as he proposes which alteration however is otherwise very plausible if the sense of the passage had absolutely required it  let us see what we can make of it without alteration  bertram tells diana that he loves her and he swears to it by loves own sweet constraint no says dr warburton this is no oath he only says he loves her by loves own sweet constraint having said in the preceding line speaking of helena i was compelled to her but i love thee by loves own constraint  but what is this but saying i was compelled to love helena by my father but i was compelled to love thee by love himself thus we see it is still as falstaff says upon compulsion and if readings were as plenty as blackberries i would adopt none of them upon compulsion besides it does not appear that bertram loves helena at all it is very presumable that bertram swore from dianas taking him so roundly to task for the profanity of his oath he said thus i was compelled to her but i love thee  by loves own sweet constraint  i e i was forced to wed helena but thou art the woman i love  she was my fathers choice thou art mine  yes by all the powers of love i e by that power which influenced my choice thou art  to which power compared with the tyrannical authority of his father he was very aptly and naturally induced to give the name of loves own sweet constraint  but supposing he did not mean to swear by the powers or power of love at this particular conjuncture it appears i think pretty evident that this was his usual oath or mode of vowing else why should he answer after being so severely schooled about his not swearing by the highest as the only holy object to swear by  love is holy and my integrity never knew the crafts that you do charge men with what then becomes of dr warburtons acute and excellent conjecture to which dr johnson has done the due honor of exalting it to the text dr warburton says that diana is not accusing bertram for swearing by a being not holy but for swearing to an unholy purpose indeed she is accusing him of both and pleads the former as a proof of the latter you cannot swear says she with any good design or to any good purpose when you swear by such profane objects for it is to be observed that the words truth and true are not here confined to the mere veracity of the terms of the oath but as in pandulphs speech in the play of king john page     where truth applied also in like manner to an oath relates as our editor himself observes to rectitude of conduct thus when diana says it is not the many oaths that make the truth but the plain single vow that is vowed true she does not mean simply that a multiplicity of oaths will not make that true which is otherwise false for this is not to be done at any rate yet what she means to say is confessely to be effected by  the plain single vow that is vowed true what she means therefore is this a multiplicity of vague and profane oaths will not justify any immoral conduct or design but that any questionable design is to be justified only by the plain single vow that is vowed true i e sworn in a regular and sacred manner and hence she proceeds to say what is not holy that we swear not by etc    diana did not doubt that bertram had a love or a passion for her according to the common acceptance of the term it was to the other part of his vow that she alludes for he not only tells her he loves her but  will for ever do her all rights of service to which she answers ay so you serve us till we serve you but when you have our roses you barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves and mock us with our bareness to this bertram eagerly replies how have i sworn to which diana as shrewdly answers  it is not the many oaths etc as much as if she had said ay how indeed  by a multiplicity of vague and profane oaths but what are these when there is neither a moral possibility of your performing your promise nor would there be any moral rectitude in it if you did for you cannot in such case take a single formal oath and call the highest to witness the truth of your promise without making a mock of his great attributes viz goodness and truth  what then becomes of dr johnsons first alteration his supposed necessity of dividing this speech between bertram and diana an alteration that would totally pervert the meaning of the passage  as to his latter alteration though it be less exceptionable it is equally unnecessary for taking the meaning of the words in the sense abovementioned the whole is perfectly intelligible and consistent if we take the highest to witness says diana which it is already observed is done only when the intent of the oath is morally good then i e in that ease pray tell me if i should swear by joves great attributes i e goodness and truth i loved you dearly would you believe my oaths when i did love you ill  i e wickedly immorally  this has no holding to swear by him whom i protest to love that i will work against him i e this is inconsistent to swear by the god of truth and holiness whom i protest to love that i will act dishonestly and wickedly nay should we even admit with dr warburton and the reviser that  this has no holding means that the oath can never hold or is not binding this will make no difference with regard to the alteration proposed the meaning of the lines in that case being only similar to those of pandulph to king john it is religion that does make vows kept but thou have sworn against religion by what thou swearst against the thing thou swearst but it may be asked why does diana protest that she loves the supreme being by whom she supposes herself to swear  if we reflect however that this protestation is nothing more than that of her love to virtue it is by no means improperly introduced to check bertrams illicit passion by depriving him of all hopes of success for it is to be remarked that though she barely mention the ill consequences to herself of being afterward abandoned by bertram the point on which she dwells upon most and seems to lay the greatest stress is the immorality of the act it may be added also that as bertram has not here made use of that very expression in his vows to diana it is not impossible that she refers to some other conversation in which he had not only sworn by loves own sweet constraint but also by her own sweet self in which case it is with great propriety she introduces by way of antithesis the protestation of her love to the god of truth and goodness being opposed to any love she can possibly entertain for him  and this supposition is not illfounded if we reflect on his calling her titled goddess and his confessedly making use only of the oaths common to lovers  my mother told me just how he would woo as if she sat ins heart she says all men have the like oaths  as to the alteration suggested in our editors appendix and founded on the bad print of the old folio i am of a different opinion to dr johnson and think that instead of making the difficulty less it would make it much greater i give my vote therefore for having the text stand as it did before either dr warburton or dr johnson meddled with it  except that the reader may if he pleases add a comma after him to swear by him whom i protest to love  vol iii page     bertram a pox on him he is a cat still   that is says dr johnson throw him how you will he lights on his legs  but why parolles is like a cat in respect to lighting upon his legs i cannot for the life of me discover bertram had said on the discovery of parolles to be a scoundrel i could endure any thing before but a cat and now he is a cat to me on the exposition of his farther baseness he says  he is more and more a cat and at last pox on him he is a cat still but as bertram gives no hint that he hates a cat for lighting upon her legs i cannot conceive where dr johnson met with authority for his explanation  it appears also that one of our editors friends was as much at a loss as i am i mean mr steevens whose objection to this illustration is inserted in the appendix bertram says mr steevens means no such thing in a speech or two before he declares his aversion to a cat and now only continues of the same opinion and says he hates parolles as much as a cat the other meaning will not do as parolles could not be meant by the cat which lights always on its legs for he is now in a fair way to be totally disconcerted  to this however dr johnson thinks proper to give no other answer than this i am still of my former opinion  well said doctor johnsonius obstinatus let not loose thy opinion thou have formed it it is truly thy own conceit and not a college of witcrackers should flout me out of my humor  thou have said it  it is enough  thou art too exalted to condescend so low as to explain thyself what are paltry readers and contemptible critics  i would give no man satisfaction i   vol iii page     king  well  call him hither we are reconciled and the first view shall kill all repetition let him not ask our pardon the nature of his great offense is dead and deeper than oblivion we do bury the incensing relics of it  dr johnson is highly offended at the poet for making the king so ready to forgive his son bertram shakespeare says he is now hastening to the end of the play finds his matter sufficient to fill up his remaining scenes and therefore as on other such occasions contracts his dialogue and precipitates his action decency required that bertrams double crime of cruelty and disobedience joined likewise with some hypocrisy should raise more resentment and that though his mother might easily forgive him his king should more pertinaciously vindicate his own authority and helens merit of all this shakespeare could not be ignonorant but shakespeare wanted to conclude his play  i shall not here undertake the defense of shakespeare as to the propriety of the kings readiness to forgive bertram though i think it might easily be done if we reflect that the match proposed to the young prince was in itself very absurd and preposterous the king laid the foundation for and provoked the act of disobedience in his son which was therefore the more excusable for it will hardly be admitted by any person in his right senses that the paternal authority of the king ought to have carried him so far as to degrade the heir apparent to his crown by marrying him to the daughter of a quack merely because she had had the good luck by one of her fathers nostrums to cure his majesty of a fistula in ano  this circumstance considered also i think it should have obtained some little favor for the character of bertram in general as well from our editor as from the very ingenious authoress of shakespeare illustrated for though he be on the whole a loose unprincipled fellow yet i think the absurdity and cruelty of this forced marriage affords a great palliation of his crimes  but my reason for stopping at this passage is to remark another instance of our editors readiness to censure shakespeare here truly shakespeare has done wrong in contracting his dialogue because he was in a hurry to finish his play whereas before the end of the play dr johnson finds fault with him again for making his dialogue too long page     he knows himself etc   this dialogue is too long since the audience already knew the whole transaction nor is there any reason for puzzling the king and playing with his passions but it was much easier than to make a pathetical interview between helen and her husband her mother and the king johnson  when was shakespeare ever accused before of wilfully avoiding a proper opportunity of introducing pathetic scenes on account of the difficulty of the task    our editors reasons for these inconsistent censures however are sufficiently evident in the one case he had an opportunity of displaying the poets precipitancy and in the other of depreciating both his application and abilities  king john vol iii page     philip knight knight good mother  basilisco like   on this passage mr theobald has a long and i think satisfactory note he supposes the word basilisco and the repetition of knight knight to refer to an old stupid play called soliman and perseda   dr warburton tells us the beauty of the passage consists in an allusion to a fixed star of the first magnitude in the constellation leo having inserted the notes of both these commentators at length the present editor makes very short work with his part of the business by adding the following sagacious animadversion to the latter could one have thought it  could one have thought it indeed a mighty pretty way this of writing annotations on shakespeare to copy two long notes from theobald and warburton and then to exclaim concerning some conundrum of the latter could one have thought it  neither your subscribers nor your booksellers i believe dr johnson thought you would have fobbed them off so shabbily for indeed when a man promised so fair could one have thought it  but perhaps this is another stroke of our editors wit  it is  ha  like enough  but could one have thought it  we have in this play several other notes of similar importance thus page     after a long note from theobald our editor adds mr theobald had the art of making the most of his discoveries but this remark however true it man be in one sense is far from being so in another for though dr johnson has made very few discoveries of his own he has discovered the method of making more of theobalds at second hand than ever the author could do when they were spick and span new  vol iii page     constance lewis stand fast the devil tempts thee here in likeness of a new and trimmed bride  in this passage our editor has two notes from theobald and warburton after which ne adopts the opinion of mr edwards who had exposed the absurdity of the latter but without mentioning him as usual  but i must not pass over a word or two which dr johnson has dropped on this occasion a commentator he says should be grave but why now doctor should a commentator be grave you seem very angry in your preface with mr pope for supposing that the task of an editor must necessarily be dull now though there is some distinction of blood between dullness and gravity they are near akin and so nearly alike in the face that you might take them for sisters ay twins with but halfanhours difference in their age i dare say now that many of your mistaken readers have frequently thought even you dull when i warrant you the doctor was only grave i do not think therefore a commentator should wear so much gravity it is good to guard against mistakes as they are frequently better prevented than amended not that i hold it decent for a scholiast to be always upon the broad grin but if the author himself be cheerful or the absurdities of a brother commentator set him a laughing where is the crime of indulging himself in it  after this let us hear no more of the gravity of a commentator see preface to johnsons shakespeare   vol iii page      if the midnight bell did with his iron tongue and brazen mouth sound one unto the drowsy race of night the folio edition has it sound on but our editor has altered it either on the authority of dr warburton or his own without giving any reason for such alteration his friend mr steevens however thinks the old reading right and conceives the meaning to be this if the midnight bell by repeated strokes was to hasten away the race of beings that are busy at that hour or quicken night in its progress the morning bell that is the bell that strikes one could never properly be made the agent for the bell has ceased to be in the service of night when it proclaims the arrival of day sound on has a particular propriety because by the repetition of the strokes at twelve it gives a much more forcible warning than when it only strikes one  this criticism is admitted by dr johnson into his appendix but as he does not there retract his former judgment we may suppose he still coincides with dr warburton or perhaps his own opinion is suspended between both mr steevenss note is ingenious enough indeed as our editor expresses himself on another occasion to deserve to be true but if the single authority of the folio edition may be set aside i am afraid the double authority of two such learned and tremendous critics as dr johnson and the bishop of gloucester will go likely to involve shakespeare in the absurdity of supposing the clock strikes but one to acquaint us of midnight for that the last right reverend critic does not think midnight merely a point of time dividing night from morning is evident from his comment on another passage of shakespeares in the midsummer nights dream where instead of the third part of a minute he would have us read the third part of the midnight now points of time as well as points of space are unextended and indivisible and yet the present editor makes no other objection to this proposed amendment than that of silently rejecting it but as this rejection is founded on other reasons than the impropriety here mentioned we may very reasonably suppose that dr johnson as well as dr warburton has found out that midnight is a determinate quantity of duration comprehending at least all that space of time which elapses between twelve at night and one in the morning this admitted it is no wonder that mr steevenss note should appear exceptionable for if he on the supposition that when night is past it must be morning can with propriety call the bell which strikes twelve a midnight bell they might with still more propriety on their supposition call that a midnight bell which strikes one  my readers will probably think i have here set the commentators together by the ears only to perplex and confound both them and the poet  not at all  the commentators were at odds before i meddled with them and i have only brought them together to show my own critical dexterity in reconciling them to each other and extricating shakespeare out of the hands of both  for instance now  to you mr steevens i attribute the honor or having illustrated the poets meaning on the supposition that he wrote strike on but sir i shall prove to your teeth in savor of your opponents that their reading of the text may be right and this even from your own argument you suppose that the bell which strikes one is a morning bell  granted  it has been so a full hour ever since the hand came to the point and the clapper struck the first stroke of twelve for you must not conceive that time stands stockstill till the clock has done striking the whole dozen and if it does not the bell must according to you be called a morning bell after the first stroke so that we see there is even a physical impossibility of a midnight bells striking more than one what then becomes of your repeated strokes and your midnight bells striking on silence that dreadful bell then it disturbs the text from its propriety  euge magne  here was i going to congratulate myself on having topt all the commentators even in their own way and on the wonderful acuteness displayed in adjusting this nice dispute but recollecting the fate of poor theobald and how severely he has been handled for boasting and making the most of his discoveries i will
