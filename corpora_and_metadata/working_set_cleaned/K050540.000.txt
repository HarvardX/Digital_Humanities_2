be when there existed in this nation a genuine vein of gothic poetry nature to the eye of the poet presented one vast scene of magical enchantment it was in the age of drayton of jonson and of shakespeare an old bard in describing the diet of oberon gives him a very appropriate band of musicians at his table but all the while his eye was served we cannot think his ear was starved but that there was in place to stir his ears the pittering grasshopper the merry cricket puling fly the piping gnats shrill minstrelsie the humming dorr the dying swan and each a chief musician i copied these lines to have an opportunity of reviving the felicitous word pittering  so imitative of the peculiar shrill and short cry of the grasshopper which is pit pit pit quickly repeated this word however is not to be found in johnson i have also introduced in the first romance another obsolete term scatterling used by spenser for a vagabond we have lost a great many exquisite and picturesque expressions through the dullness of our lexicographers and have impoverished the natural graces of our language some neologisms have their merit but to revive the dead is a greater merit  her flying hand with

seminal hint of this allegory lies in a very juvenile essay in prose on romances where romance is defined the offspring of love and fiction that essay has been inserted in the encyclopedia britannica entire without additions and without my knowledge and i cannot but reprobate so unjust a proceeding in thus compelling a writer to become responsible for a copious article without at first consulting with him on the propriety of improving the effusions of his youth  from that blessed hour on earth the beauty glowed and sought with social man her dear abode with all her mothers sorcery paints each

desert sitting around a fire listening to their tales with such attention and pleasure as totally to forget the fatigue and hardship with which an instant before they were entirely overcome mr wood in his journey to palmyra notices the same circumstance at night the arabs sat in a circle drinking coffee etc while one of the company diverted the rest by relating a piece of history on the subject of

or in large halls erected for this purpose in order to amuse themselves with traditional narrations professed storytellers are of early date in the east at this day men of rank have generally one or more male or females among their attendants who amuse them and their women when melancholy and indisposed and they are generally employed to lull them asleep richardsons dissertation on the eastern

many a moorish song romances old a mute delighted throng i read and i believed  in earliest youth each tear was genuine and each fiction truth the alhambra was a sublime specimen of saracenic architecture combining the gigantic in its outline and delicacy in its minuter parts it was a gorgeous magnificence of which the timid and chastised architecture of greece can yield no sensation it has been often described its bath surrounded by flowers and orange trees its marble courts its ceilings and walls incrusted with the most intricate fretwork gilded and painted its fantastic mosaic its court of colossal lions its vast length of colonnades its columns of virgin marble its fountains its glittering floors and its delicious gardens these form some of its romantic features  the  historia de las guerras civiles de granada i read at an early period and at a time when i could most enjoy it for i believed it to be an authentic history it is however a considerable romance relating the civil wars of the two moorish factions in spain it is embellished with numerous romances antiguos the word romance in spanish and french means ballad of the same species of our rude ballads preserved in the relics of ancient poetry these romances are however more elegant and two have been translated by the editor of the relics often on the plain before the towers of the alhambra must many a maiden have beheld the man she loved become the destroyer of her race or her own relatives pursuing with fire and sword the family of her lover in composing these lines i had in my mind one of these romances where a very delicate circumstance is ingeniously conceived by the poet in  la fiesta de san juan while the moors assemble to joust in the plain before the alhambra xarifa and fatima who had not been together for some time are at the window of a turret xarifa exclaims to fatima sweet sister how thou art touched by love thou were wont to have color on thy cheek and thou art now pale thou were wont to talk of our loves and thou art now silent come nearer to the window thou will see the lovely abindarraez his splendid equipage and his gallant air fatima replies if i am pale it is not that i am touched with love if i have lost my colors alas have i not a just cause has not that alabez killed my father pointing to a knight on the plain no eftoy tocada de amores ni en mi vida los tratara si se

expressive of a strong sensation of delight the harp differed from the santry or psaltry in that the former was a stringed instrument and the latter was mounted with wire a vielle was something like a guitar  a minstrel on horseback is thus described entour son col porta son tabour depeynt dor et rich azur   a learned antiquary tells me that the squire minstrel was not known among the early

their gothic page towers lakes and gardens fays and paynims rose the fine deliriums of romantic prose oh gothic muse each child of fancy blessed drank sweet nutrition from thy milky breast to albions shores thy family have roved and every brother genius met and loved the poetical student is well acquainted with this intercourse ariosto was the father of spenser and milton kept his majestic eye on the solemn tasso and the italian bards borrowed largely of those gorgeous legends those old romances of gothic origin which have been the nutriment of the true poet in his youth miltons affection for these lofty fables and romances among which his young feet wandered is well known johnson was enthusiastically delighted by the old spanish folio romance of felixmarte of hircania and other romances of chivalry collins was bewildered among their magical seductions it merits observation that the most ancient romances were originally composed in verse before they were converted into prose no wonder therefore that the lacerated members of the poet have been so cherished by the sympathy of poetical minds don quixotes was a very agreeable insanity    what hand may dare thy sealed fountains break and lost to fame thy sleeping homers wake i hear a voice and bourdeauxs goldhaired knight laboring through clouds of dust stalks beautiful in light lord of each grace lo wielands measures swell the tones of sothebys enchanting shell of these old romances some writers of learning and taste have employed their leisure in giving them a rejuvenescence which has been grateful to some modern readers in these refaccimentos count tressan has proved eminently successful the oberon of wieland lately familiarised to the english reader by the version of mr sotheby is a refaccimento of the old romance of huon of bourdeaux wielands characteristic excellence is the graceful and in voluptuous scenery he has perhaps never been exceeded all his various tales and multifarious compositions respire exquisite delicacy and a refined imagination his genius seems elegantly described by a critic in the monthly review who says of him that the youngest of the graces not the highest of the muses besought for him of apollo the gift of song i cannot but lament that the great or little personage who gives his name to the poem scarcely ever appears in it    oh vain who deem their miracles are lies profound their seas and deep their pearlbeds rise and they a wholesome intellect who breathe admire the doctrine hid with art beneath ma voi ch avete gl intelletti sani mirate le dottrine che sasconde sotto queste coperte alte e profonde berni all the writers of these gothic fables lest they should be considered as mere triflers pretended to an allegorical meaning concealed under the texture of their fable even tasso was placed in a severe dilemma to prove that his epic poem was a pious allegory it happened however sometimes that the ingenuity of the writer contrived to extract from his romantic adventures some moral design of these i have selected two as specimens    when raymond broke his oath and fatal zeal dared with his swords point pierce the gate of steel his melusina tender woman there he views in marble fount with streaming hair her right hand guide a comb the waves light trail flashing its fine spray from a scaly tail with horrid force the fishywoman laves and over the vast saloon she dashed the spumy waves lo raymond sickens at the unhallowed sight and starts abhorrent of that magic rite thy fate oh simple man shall lovers fear and learn a womans secret to revere in the old romance of melusina this lovely fairy though to the world unknown as such enamoured of count raymond marries him but first extorts a solemn promise that he will never disturb her on saturdays on those days the inferior parts of her body are metamorphosed to that of a mermaid as a punishment for a former error agitated by the malicious insinuations of a friend his curiosity and his jealousy one day conduct him to the spot she retired to at those times it was an obscure place in the dungeon of the fortress his hand stretched out feels an iron gate oppose his passage nor can he discover a single chink but at length perceives by his touch a loose nail he places his sword in its head and screws it out through this hole he sees melusina in the horrid form she is compelled to assume he repents of his fatal curiosity she reproaches him and their mutual happiness is for ever lost i must observe that when this romance was written however mavelous it appears to us it was doubtless considered in that age as an authentic history if any beautiful woman was an adept in astronomy or distinguished by her sagacity and cultivated mind she was immediately reported to be a fairy and if she was ugly or deformed she was sometimes burnt as a witch  when macedons prince his perceforest pursued in british land along the enchanted wood the monarch vows each knight in parting vows one place shall only yield one nights repose till they rejoin  the adventurous king at night enters the fair sebillas castled height the beauty loved and her voluptuous eyes smile at his vow and dart their witcheries wreathed by her arms for ten revolving suns each over the inconscious prince uncounted runs the tenth the incantation broke he flies and casts one longing lingering look and sighs he meets his peers and blames their loitering way making such little speed since yesterday but they returning from the sorcerers soil swear ten revolving suns have seen them toil too late the prince those witching eyes would blame that broke his vow and lost ten days of fame so tells the fiction beautys magic blaze melts years to months and months dissolves to days this adventure is related in the extensive romance of perceforest of which i have seen an edition in six folios the title opens thus the most elegant delicious mellifluous and delightful history of perceforest king of great britain etc the most ancient edition is that of      the present adventure is finely narrated but too long to be inserted here alexander the great is accompanied by a page who with the ladys maid falls into the same mistake as his master they enter the castle with deep wounds and issue perfectly recovered i will give the latter part as a specimen of the manner when they were once out of the castle the king said truly floridas i know not how it has been with me but certainly sebilla is a very honorable lady and very beautiful and very charming in conversation sire said floridas it is true but one thing surprises me how is it that our wounds have healed in one night i thought at least ten or fifteen days were necessary truly said the king that is astonishing  now king alexander met gadiffer king of scotland and the valiant knight le tors well said the king have ye news of the king of england ten days we have hunted him and cannot find him out how said alexander did we not separate yesterday from each other in gods name said gadiffer what means your majesty it is ten days  have a care what you say cried the king sire replied gadiffer it is so ask le tors on my honor said le tors the king of scotland speaks truth then said the king some of us are enchanted floridas did thou not think we separated yesterday  truly truly your majesty i thought so but when i saw our wounds healed in one night i had some suspicion that we were enchanted    a pupil wild in fancys viewless choir such strains once touched me with diviner fire dear lost companions time too long has stole from ye through idle years my truant soul once more your heights are mine i tread once more your fairy road and build a little bower from a delirious earth avert mine eyes and dry my fruitless tears and seek fictitious skies if with the few these labors light may plead to snatch me from the populace who read should not their taste my various page offend wanting that polish which themselves can lend not slight the honor my weak hand shall seize for trifles are not trifles when they please mejnoun and leila the arabian petrarch and laura advertisement among the literary treasures of a learned and valued friend francis douce esquire of gowerstreet  has been long admired a persian manuscript splendidly illuminated the universal language of painting had so far rendered it intelligible that our eyes had instructed us it was a history of love it was at length inspected by two competent judges sir john kennaway whose urbanity of manners claims the remembrance of his friends and major ouseley a studious orientalist of taste we now found that it contained the loves of mejnoun and leila whose story told by different poets is as popular in the east as the loves of abelard and eloisa or those of petrarch and laura are in the west  the learned m de cardonne the late king of frances oriental interpreter discovered in the royal library a copy of this romance and has given a skeleton of the story in the bibliotheque des romans for july       it was meant perhaps but to gratify the curiosity of the learned it has no exhibition of character no description of scenery no conduct of the passions but i could perceive in the simplicity of analysis and a tale with little involution of fable something which might be made to delight the imagination  a maniac and a lover vehement genius at variance with the tenderest domestic feelings cherishing the social duties yet still violating them by the fatal energy of an unhappy passion the catastrophe involving the fates of himself and of all whom he loved the local descriptions were susceptible of some novelty in a word i discovered a new petrarch and laura but two fervid orientalists capable of more passion more grief and more terror instead of the petty solitude of the valclusa of petrarch an arabian desert opened its numerous horrors instead of the cold prudery of the italian laura i have the resolute ardour of the arabian leila and instead of a poet so elegant and delicate that his passion some suspect to have been only a fine chimera i have a lover whose sincerity every one acknowledges since he is distracted with his passion  nb the note on the hair of women at page  0 is further carried on at page      mejnoun and leila the arabian petrarch and laura part the first where yemen or arabia the happy borders on arabia the desert from the singular local situation of arabia the inequalities in the nature of its lands are indeed very remarkable on one side are frightful deserts and on the other fertile and delightful vales niebuhrs travels through arabia vol ii p   0  sir william jones observes that yemen signifies verdure and felicity in sultry climates the freshness of the shades and the coolness of the waters are ideas almost inseparable from those of happiness    among the bedoweens or pastoral arabs ahmed kais was a distinguished schieck his numerous tents were stretched through many a green valley while his innumerous herds told their master was now old and in peace with the world ahmed in youth had been the most enterprising and predatory adventurer want had conducted him to opulence and valor to power but in his opulence there was no avarice and in his power there was no tyranny his former life had consisted but of two kinds of days the days of council and the days of combat the hospitable man now found no other than festal days unknown to fame during his erratic youth when his virtues became stationary his magnanimous soul diffused itself in the domestic enchantments of peace nor with the penurious feeling of age was he negligent of that creative benevolence that prodigality of mind which is felt by the next generation old as he was he still planted young trees and full of glory he still sought for solitary spots to open new fountains he was described by the poets to be bountiful as the rains of spring warm as the sun and cheerful as the moon the heart of ahmed they said has espoused the whole earth and when he dies she will wail in widowhood  ahmed without offspring sighed to perpetuate himself in his descendants and mourned to think that the populous felicity his princely and solitary hand had created should be dispersed with his last breath at length he had a son the solitary hope of his tribe to this cherished child he sought to give all that instruction can communicate and all that humanity can feel he invited the ingenious and the learned to his tent showing his boy to his people he would exclaim enter ye sages and bring your instruction it is the only tribute we claim from sages or tell me where the prince can discover a sage and majesty shall prostrate itself before wisdom  the revered name of the effendi lebid the persian student reached the ear of the arabian chief lebid had chosen the tranquillity of retirement and when his name became every where celebrated his person was unknown he might have been seated with indolent glory in the chair of the royal medrasseh an academy at ispahan but he preferred to interrogate nature in a sublime solitude in the plains of shinaar he had accurately measured a degree of the great circle of the earth on the shores of the bosphorus he had taught the despised inhabitants the arts of an invaluable fishery and the voice of population broke along those solitary skies in benighted deserts he discovered a path for the caravan by the guidance of a friendly star and the same eye that traced the course of a star watched the growth of a flower he gave to chemistry the alembic which still retains its arabian extraction in its name he had composed one of the moallakat or poems suspended in the temple of mecca and arabia was delighted by the novelty of his diction which was a fine unison of picture and of melody it flowed with the confluent richness of the various tribes of arabia and selecting from every dialect its felicitous expressions he poured an enchantment over every period he enriched the copiousness of the arabic by the delicacy of the persian and the fire of the turkish muse and received the secret graces and the fine conceptions of his favorite poets as iron often attracted by the loadstone catches some particles of the magnetic influence and in touching the magnet becomes itself a magnet  such was the effendi lebid to whose persian academy resorted those young arabians who were ambitious of acquiring persian literature and habituating themselves to persian urbanity kais the son of ahmed proved a pupil worthy of the preceptor about the same time and nearly of the same age was there placed the lovely leila the only daughter of an emir an emir distinguished by a green turban claims his descent from fatima the wife of mahomet   the effendi discovered in these early associated children that facility of disposition which at once characterises genius and a tender heart soon without rivals in the academy each was attracted to the other by a mutual admiration leila instructed herself by fondly repeating the lessons of kais and kais taught himself to retain whatever charmed leila with easy grace the studious youth disclosed the most solemn truths while the more touching and delicate ideas were discriminated by the quick susceptibility of leila they loved to mingle in the same tasks and in the arts of imagination their gentle spirits perpetuated their finest emotions the verse of kais treasured their most delicious sensations from the wild intonations of leila he often caught the air he composed and when they united to paint the same picture it seemed as if the same eye had directed the same hand  they saw each other every day and were only sensible to this pleasure their mutual studies became so many interchanges of tenderness every day was contracted to a point of time months rolled away on months and their passage was without a trace a year closed and they knew it but by its date already the first spark of love opened the heart of kais already he sighed near the intendering form of leila already he listened for her voice when she ceased to speak while her soft hand passing over his own vibrated through his shivering nerves  endearment was his occupation he loved to consider himself as her slave and playfully entreated to be chided by her charming voice in the winter as she sat beside him he burned the costly wood of aloes and hung around perfumed tapers the nails of her fingers he tinted with the softest blush of the rose and drew the dark line of the brilliant surmeh an impalpable powder employed for this purpose lady montague dislikes the rose color with which the orientals tinge their nails under her lids which gave her eyes a shining and tremulous languor he sprinkled the ottargul gul is rose ottar is essence  more precious than fluid gold on her tissued caftan a robe  he pounded rubies to mingle with her rich confection mr dallaway in his constantinople notices the conserve of rubies so called as well from the richness of the other ingredients as that pounded rubies are a part of the composition so capricious are their preparations in the confectionary art p   0 however absurd this practice appears it is not improbable it may be derived from something more than caprice an able chemist assures me that precious stones have a peculiar acid which has been proved by an experiment how this acid can be extracted by the confectioner has not yet been explained    and infused in her repast the seed of the poppy that she might enjoy light slumbers and awake with eyes luminous with pleasure and a glowing cheek that bore the soft vestige of a soft dream  in summer he blended the turkish magnificence with the persian amenity in his garden he had raised a fountain paved with the verdurous jasper and adorned with pillars of the red porphyry and leading up the waters over masses of white marble they lightly tumbled along flinging their spray in a soft cascade near its cooling murmurs he built a pleasant kiosque a banqueting or summer apartment  the water from the fountain was conveyed into conchs fixed in the gilded fretwork of the ceiling and now melodiously chimed along and now fell dashing from shell to shell the columns were embellished with moral sentences from the koran while through the green trellises he had so thickly woven a living tapestry of vines of woodbines of passionflowers and the triplecoloured roses of persia that the tender obscurity of its chastised light threw over the gardenpavlion something like enchantment often our lovers felt there the charm of a delicious reverie amidst the flowers the waters and the shades  in this retreat he presented her with sherbets covered with snows and flavoured with the distilled dews of roses and spread before her those pomegranates whose impalpable kernels dissolved at the touch in a refreshing and dulcet water chardin says il y en a dont le pepin est si tender quon ne le sent presque pas sous le dent    his garden exhausted the splendid year of the persian flora and through the umbrageous wilderness of flowers the eye could not find a passage to escape arbours fountains grottos fruit trees and a labyrinth of walks were all thrown together in a playful confusion the zephyrs there wasted a cloud of odours and a snow of blossoms beautiful spot where while the mind was occupied with meditating on some flowers and fruits other flowers and fruits rose to the eye alternating the pleasant thoughts beautiful spot where no other regret was known than the thought of quitting thee  seated in the kiosque they would read the persian tales the tender eyes of leila were sometimes for a moment fixed on kais while a warm modest suffusion colored his ingenuous cheek what taste thou have displayed kais would leila say in the composition of this delicious scene and how thou charmest me with thy tales thou make my hours so pleasant ah what were life without romances and without a garden indeed leila would kais reply i have done little more than borrow those hints from nature which to those who study nature she indicates the earth has been at once my canvass and my colors and i have made it my picture where i found an amiable scenery i opened the soliciting luxuriance where an embowering shade i placed a seat and where nature wantoned with irregular fancies i was careful not to baulk the charming caprice i have drawn no straight lines no formal squares no smooth insipidities the heart leila claims one spot in this universe for its attachment and let it be an embellished garden and rich fields of cotton and rice shall never cause me a sigh  thou art right kais in a garden it is labors are concealed by its pleasures and art which has touched every thing never points its visible finger the senses feel nothing but enjoyment and i do think that gardens are favorable to lovers for thou may observe how in thy tales it is ever in a garden that lovers converse with extreme tenderness  true replied kais cashmere the land of love is one wondrous garden it is haunted by the delicate forms of the peiri gay creatures of the elements whose pure natures are created of odorous substances who vest themselves in the lucidity of light adorn their heads with rainbow hues bathe in the dews of the morning and touch nothing more gross than the vapor of fragrance it is said that should a lovely peiri suffer one drop of her ambrosial saliva to fall on the earth no human sense could live in the poignancy of its perfume these peries are the spirits of the persians major ouseley finds it impossible to give an accurate idea of what the persian poets designed by a peri this aerial being not resembling our fairies the strongest resemblance he can find is in the description of milton in comus the sublime idea which milton entertained of a fairy vision corresponds rather with that which the persian poets have conceived of the peries their port was more than human as they stood i took it for a fairy vision of some gay creatures of the element that in the colors of the rainbow live and play in the plighted clouds   of musk camphire ambergris and similar fragrant substances the persians believe angels to be formed and other creatures endued with uncommon purity of nature thus the poets compliment their mistresses on the delightful odours which they diffuse these aerial beings called peries are supposed to exist on perfumes alone and even of paradise celestial fragrance is among the chief delights  the dives are comtrasted with the peries and are pictured as hideous in form and malignant in mind such indeed is the malignancy of their nature that they can endure nothing fragrant the dives are all males and the peries all females a compliment to the sex they reside in the visionary country of jinnistan richardson in his curious dissertation on the eastern nations affords us several fanciful characteristics of this new race of ideal beings     i have heard much said leila of cashmere do thou believe that the place exists  assuredly it does but who equals leila i have never seen a peiri thou know it is difficult to gain admittance there a happy man who once did gave me this description of the paradise of love the land of cashmere sir william jones in his essay on the poetry of the eastern nations tells us there is a valley to the north of indostan called cashmere which according to an account written by a native of it is a perfect garden etc the happy temperature of this much celebrated spot and the country itself is lately described by mr pennant in his history of hindostan the following florid description which is not however merely fanciful is composed by a persian poet major ouseley gives it us in his persian miscellanies p     i have seen irak and india khorassan and persia but no place equal to cashmere in beauty and in excellence of climate during the whole year from cashmere to the borders of cathay the air tempered by gentle showers has all the mildness of spring there are flowers and green herbage plains and running streams palaces cupolas and public buildings beautiful to view on every side are rising grounds crystal springs and lofty trees amid mountains covered with nuttrees apple trees and fig trees festivity and pleasure peculiarly abound there in mirth and revelry the cashmerians pass away their time on silken cushions they all wear shawls whether of illustrious birth or of the lowest class how shall i describe the lovely damsels of this country for in my opinion

montagues curious description of a turkish loveletter by the use of intermingled flowers of which each color denotes the state of the lovers heart is well known to the reader  mr de peyssonel in his observations on baron totts memoirs has given a description of declarations of love as practiced among the turks very curious and less known he says reciprocal declarations are generally made in turkey by means of maanes or enigmatical declarations for example a pistachionut is sent called in turkish fistik the device which rhimes to it is ikimuze bir iastik that is may we both have the same pillow uzum a grape or raisin the device is senum itchun iandum that is my heart is in a blaze for you ipek a bit of silk the device is seni seuerum pek that is i love you passionately    the pleasant land of love is in cashmere and nuts and flowers are all the treasures here who tells the shawled beauties of those bowers each day their moonlight foreheads veiled with flowers it may be necessary to explain the expression of  moonlight foreheads major ouseley tells us on the expression  moonfaced that a persian mistress would be highly flattered by its application an epithet however for which i believe few of our fair countrywomen would thank a lover anvari describes a favorite damsel with a face lovely as the moon another poet describes a beauty  moonfaced with looks like the timid glances of the fawn  as for the expression itself which may at first appear to us uncouth i feel it exquisitely even without placing ourselves in the situation of an arab whose purest delight is that of contemplating the tranquil moon in the restoring airs of a summer night who is not sensible that the allusion is made to that tender melancholy which the aspect of the moon produces on a pensive feeling mind and this tenderness how often does the lover behold in the touching seriousness of a beloved female the moonlight is perhaps even more tender than the view of the moon itself    their

 second edition has these fine strictures on the hair of women the hair by its comparative roughness and its partial concealments accompanies and relieves the softness clearness and smoothness of the face of a beautiful woman where the hair has no natural roughness it is often artificially curled and crisped the instrument for this purpose is certainly of very ancient date as virgil who probably studied the costume of the heroic ages makes turnus speak contemptuously of eneas for having his locks perfumed and as madame de sevigne expresses it frises naturellement avec des fers vibratos calido ferro myrrhaque madentes   the natural roughness or crispness of hair is often mentioned as a beauty lauree crespe crini capelli crespe e lunghe e doro  in catholic countries where those unfortunate victims of avarice and superstition are supposed to renounce all idea of pleasing our sex the first ceremony is that of cutting off their hair as a sacrifice of the most seducing ornament of beauty and the formal edge of the fillet which prevents a single hair from escaping is well contrived to deaden the effect of features  haycinthine locks is frequent among the arabic poets and which sir w jones delightfully renders the fragrant hyacinths of azzas hair that wanton with the laughing summer air   from the orientalists it passed to the greeks and our milton adopts it hyacinthin locks round from his parted forehed manly hung clustering but not beneath his shoulders broad   the term clustering observes the author of vathek is given by the ancients to that disposition of the curls which resembles the growth of grapes and may be observed on gems coins and statues the following verses of petrarch on hair are exquisite sir w jones gives them as an evidence of the manner of the asiatic poets agreeing with the italians one would almost imagine says he these lines to be translated from the persian aura che quelle chiome bionde e crespe circondi e movi e fe mossa de loro soavemente e spargi quel dolce oro e poi l raccogli e n bei nodi l increspe     a thousand youths a thousand damsels pair who by their true loves black eyes sweetly swear if the reader should find entertainment in the followlong note it would be unjust to complain  the asiatics have in great admiration black or darkcoloured eyes which in their descriptions of a perfect beauty are almost always enumerated among the most powerful and striking charms the poet hafez says the impression which blackeyed damsels have made on my heart will never be effaced the houris of paradise derive their name from a beautiful womans black eye the epithet blackeyed among the eastern writers seems to be synonymous with beautiful the women use artificial means to give a dark appearance to their eyes sanson in his voyage de perse informs us that they set little value on blue gray or hazel eyes the black alone are admired among the persians ouseleys persian miscellanies p      it is finely imagined by the author of caliph vathek that akensides rich expression in the dark heaven of miras eye might have been suggested by the black eyes of the virgins of paradise  in an eccentric dissertation on cats by moncrief are the following notices on blue or gray eyes the eyes of cats says our dissertator in his mock eulogy were for a long time the objects of female ambition they could receive no praise more flattering than to discover that they had bluish gray eyes that is changing like those of cats or greenish as they commonly have la fontaine has given minerva such eyes tout le rest entouroit la deesse aux yeux pers   marot gives green eyes to venus le premier jour que venus aux yeux verse   the lord de coucy so celebrated for his loves acknowledges in his verses that such eyes were the secret charms that madame de fayel practiced on him these bluish gray eyes are those which commonly are of a pale blue or sometimes of a watercolour which varies or undulates with different shades in the course of the day the green eyes never change their shades diodorus siculus tells us that pallas was named by the egytians glaucopis that is having eyes of a greenish white and popes blueeyed maid has been censured for being inexact it should be  eyes of a bright citron histoire des chats p      it is a custom in the east to tinge the eyes of women particularly those of a fair complexion with an impalpable powder prepared chiefly from crude antimony it is of a purple color and a persian poet compares it to the violet the arabian poets compare the eyelids of a fine woman bathed in tears to violets dropping with dew shakspeare has violets dim but sweeter than the lids of junos eyes   the ancient greek poets both homer and anacreon have also alluded to the same cosmetic since both of them ascribe a purplish hue to a female eye when tasso represents love as ambushed sotto all ombra delle palpebre  he allegorically alludes to that appearance in nature which the artifice here described the impalpable powder was meant to counterfeit caliph vathek notes p      winkelman in his reflections on the painting and sculpture of the greeks writes that his researches concerning the mysterious art said to be practiced among the greeks of changing blue eyes into black ones have not succeeded to his wish i find it mentioned but once by dioscorides could i have cleared up this art it would have been a problem worthy to fix the attention of the newtons and the algarottis and have interested the fair sex by a discovery so advantageous to their charms especially in germany where large fine blue eyes are more frequently met with than black ones the same author also notices the green eyes we have alluded to and gives us the charming line in which the sieur de coucy describes the eyes of madame de fayel et si bell oeil vert et riant et clair     lovely as joseph when he blushed to love warm as zuleikha sighed the boy to prove zuleikha is the name of potiphars wife whose amors with joseph form one of the most celebrated poems in the persian language there is a copy of this work in the bodleian library at oxford which i am told is one of the finest in europe a persian poet thus describes this heroine of disappointed passion with energy zuleikha one night impatient and distracted the twinsister of affliction and to whom sorrow was a familiar friend  drank to the very dregs of the cup of wretchedness and from the burning anguish of passion passed the night without repose    sir w jones in his literal version of his celebrated ode of hafez in his persian grammar has i can easily conceive how the enchanting beauties of joseph affected zuleikha so deeply that her love tore the veil of her chastity what an elegant metaphor he has pleasingly versified the passage beauty has such resistless power that even the chaste egyptian dame sighed for the blooming hebrew boy for her how fatal was the hour when to the banks of nilus came a youth so lovely and so coy     called by a kindling smile the lover roves rosedropping bowers and citronbreathing groves but soon he claims a still and lone repose the quiet twilight of the curtained boughs what can like beauty solitude endear the loneliest spots are happiest in cashmere though many a brilliant charm adorns their noon they love more dear the solitary moon then halfbreathed whispers close their kisses sweet and snowy through the shades their chacing feet then bursts the enchantment round  the wanderers mark the shining rocks dim vales and arbours dark some sit retired and some in dances bound while hollow hills their silver voices sound no moonlight scene to lovers is so dear as when its yellow light sleeps over cashmere   the effendi was not insensible to the progress of a passion of which the lovers were too young to conceal the sentiment and too innocent to fear the indulgence age had not chilled the gentle soul of lebid he renewed a delicious remembrance of the pleasures of his youth in those of our lovers and enjoying their happiness frequently for the remuneration of kais he decreed a kiss from the lips of leila he recited to them the tenderest tales where the divine passion of love prevailed over the sense of death  he thus narrated the tender story of mesri and delilah mesri that affectionate youth was betrothed to the lovely delilah they were the grace of the classic schirauz and the tender choir of schirauz only sang of them already the rich pavilion flames the bower is festooned and the hymenial air has preluded to shame the protraction of the halfreluctant maid on their nuptial day they were sailing on the sea the crimson veil of marriage covered the face of the maiden the crimson veil at once tells the hour of joy and the blush of love the bridal veil of the persian ladies is made of red silk or muslin  their friends their parents rush to the shore their choral voices resound hymns of love and the lute and the cymbal and the harp melt in varieties of harmony the dancers toiling to the timbrel bound along the shore how the wave laughs joyous to the fanning gale how the painted bark glides continuous on the water never was the sea so smooth never was the sun so bright ah the songs the dances cease  a whirlpool is in the sea  wheeling the flashing waves the light bark darts round and round and drops the lovers are in the sea  a friend toils to stretch the savior hand to mesri  alas the beauty floats on the distant waves and the savior hand is stretched but mesri turns from land he points to his beloved he cries learn not the tale of love from the wretch who flies his mistress in the hour of danger leave me and save my maid he meets her in the midst of the sea his arms embrace her on the deep one farewell gleam played on her opening eyelids they drink one wave on their bridal bed the whole world admires the speech of mesri  with such tales he nourished their youthful hearts and taught them the enthusiasm of passion with the aged effendi beside them they would stroll to gather the first rose of spring and watch its virgin and glowing bud and gaze in fondness on its maturer bloom and sigh with the last breath of its departing sweetness among the persians observes major ouseley it has ever been the object of elegant luxury to gather the first rose of spring the ancients ascribed the origin of this sweet flower to the blood of venus and to the warmth of her kiss the modern latin poet secundus affirms the rose is indebted for its glowing tints anacreon calls that lovely flower the most excellent of the fragrant tribe the chief care of spring and the delight even of the gods mr franklin in his tour to persia notices a persian custom under the name of gul reazee or the scattering of roses from the vast quantity of those flowers strewed in the apartments this ceremony continues a week or ten days during which time the guests are entertained with music sherbets dancing etc with roses they wreathed the hoary head of the effendi and his dimmed eyes would then sparkle with a lambent radiance like that of youth he pressed the young lovers to his heart and exclaimed looking on leila ah to whom will the smiling rosebuds of thy lips give delight oh sweet branch of a tender plant for whose use do thou grow sir william jones  are they not mine would kais quickly reply while his young eyes beamed with joy yes they are mine are they not leila  yes the blushing maid replied thine and the effendis  as leila stood near kais frequently the bloom of her complexion was flushed with a vermil glow and the effendi would compare the fair cheek of leila as she stood near her lover to the lily that placed too near the rose is crimsoned by its warm reflection  the mother of leila observed that when she quitted the academy of the effendi she paced pensively with reluctant feet but on the day of her return she was seen tripping as she went with opening smiles and light steps leila she said will become a celebrated student to me she brings only a silent form embellished by new graces in the academy she leaves her whole soul at length the beauteous leila seemed to mourn in the tents of her father and to concentrate her thoughts sought a solitude of palm trees the cautious mother commanded the slaves who accompanied her to be vigilant over their mistress even to her eyes ah the discovery was too easy all was too faithfully reported to the parents of leila they were told how the eyes of kais were only occupied by the face of leila and how leila never wandered from his side and that in a magnificent kiosque they passed their evenings reciting romances  the father of leila was a haughty emir the green turban which he wore as the descendant of fatima was incessantly before his eyes and rendered his heart obdurate he heard with indignation of the affection of our lovers and considered that the vulgarity of the blood of ahmed was not yet purified through an age of nobility poetry he conceived was a diabolical magic of which though his sanctity and his ignorance preserved him from the influence he had heard was potent over the feeble heart of a woman he recalled leila severely reprimanded the sufferer for cherishing an ignoble passion for a poet without a green turban and asserting that no woman should aspire to be poetical he added that terrible persian proverb used on these occasions when the hen crows like the cock we must cut its throat chardin writes les hommes ont trop de peur de lesprit des femmes pour leur laisser rien apprendre et surtout en matiere de poesy il y a parmi eux ce proverb sur ce sujet si la poule veut chanter comme le coq il lui faut couper la gorge vol ii  to p        he hired a dervise to admonish her of the fate of an imprudent passion and to remind her of her fathers green turban but the pompous admonition was unfelt by the enamoured beauty the learned doctor was more skilled in genealogy than in eloquence he received no other reply than the warmest tears which he persisted to say were no arguments  kais who adored his mistress till her presence had become a portion of his existence and whose soul beat with the peculiar vehemence of genius had not been long separated from leila when he found himself incapacitated to pursue his studies he who at the feet of his master had stood with his hands folded on his breast to listen with reverence to his dictates now voluntarily rejected the studious glories of the medrasseh he wandered at times in his mind and remembered nothing of the college but the affection he felt for the regent he neglected his food his whole frame was debilitated and at times his actions were extravagant as if awakening from a long reverie he seemed desirous of escaping from his mental irritation by the efforts of his corporeal powers the effendi saw not without alarm the energy of his passion his pulse was accelerated his nights were sleepless and his whole frame was shaken by chilly fits or glowing heats in the variation of his passions to mention even the name of leila was dangerous he sent kais to his father and warned him of his passion for leila but ahmed solemnly forbid the alliance the greenturbaned emir was haughty for his descent but ahmed was haughty because he was glorious without nobility and derived his renown not from men extinct in their graves but from the living men around him  in vain ahmed forbid the passion of kais his nights only yielded dreams of love and his voice only repeated amatory verses every day he composed some intendering poem which was soon treasured in the memories of his admiring bedoweens as he wandered among his tents he listened to the recitation of his own verses the world seemed occupied by his passion the name of leila was echoed through a wide extent of country and the polished poetry of kais then promised the immortality it has since obtained his eminence as a poet was known to distant tribes and in her paternal imprisonment leila listened with complacency to verses painting her beauties and resounding her virtues the immortal rhimes wasted his eternal sighs and as they were carolled by the traveller to her the whole world seemed to be the witnesses of his affection  one of his smaller poems composed about this time was the following one in which the nightingale personifies the poet a persian ode to spring almond thy drops of light are hung alluding to the white blossoms of the almond tree  and the old earth again is young through the blue rejoicing sky often the laughing echoes fly the western gale over beauty flows whispering and kissing as he goes violets that weep with eyes so blue the bent narcissus languid hue the myrtle in whose verdurous glow hangs a chaste tuft of downy snow the jasmine from whose pallid cheeks rejected love her deathtint seeks the anemones resplendent breast a virgin in a bridal vest say loitering rose where have thou been awake thy blush inflame the scene thee all our creeping violets eye and kiss thy feet adore and die it is well known that at the appearance of the roses the violets begin to fade  fair conqueror mid thy armed train an arabian image a poet describing this flower says the rose approaches

without a crystal cup that glows with odorous wine this vernal vale and what thy bard without his maid light of these eyes warmth of this blood the spring  were but a desert shade and choirful heaven  a solitude the marriage of the rose and the nightingale the incessant theme of persian poetry is described with an eastern luxuriance of imagination by dr darwin in his botanic garden part ii canto   ver  0   i add the following delightful passage from major ouseleys persian miscellanies the excessive delight which the persian nightingale derives from the enjoyment of the roses fragrance affords a thousand beautiful allulusions and allegories to the eastern poet to account for this allegorical passion entertained by the nightingale for the rose and which is the subject of so much beautiful imagery in persian poetry we must consider that the plaintive voice of that sweet bird is first heard at the same season of the year in which the rose begins to blow by a natural association of ideas they are therefore connected as the constant and inseparable attendants of the spring it is probable too that the nightingales favorite retreat may be the rosegarden and the leaves of that flower occasionally his food but it is certain that he is delighted with its smell and sometimes indulges in the fragrant luxury to such excess as to fall from the branch intoxicated and helpless to the ground  the coincidence between the arrival of certain birds and the flowering of certain plants has been observed by naturalists and in attica the cuckoo always arriving when the fig tree first appeared the cuckoo and a young fig were called by the same name dr darwin conjectures that a similar coincidence of appearance in some part of asia gave occasion to the story of the love of the rose and nightingale so much celebrated by the eastern poets  botanic garden part ii canto   p         at a solemn banquet held in the tents of ahmed to celebrate the rising geniuses of his tribe and at which the effendi assisted the chief presided although a military man he patronized these exercises of genius and intellectual combats in which arabia gloried he sat on an elevated seat under an umbrageous geous platane surrounded by the judges on each side were four copious vases filled with gold and silver and as he was pleased and they approved he put his hands into the vases and distributed his rewards in proportion to the merit of each candidate to some he conveyed a handful of silver for their encouragement to others he measured his gold to excite their emulation while sometimes he would rise from his seat and empty in the rapture of pleasure an overflowing vase richardson in his preliminary discourse to his persian dictionary notices this national assembly held for poetical contests  but when the public shouts distinguished kais among his peers ahmed slowly raised his venerable form a tear glimmered in the old warriors eye he stroked his beard and spoke  alas my friends why do ye celebrate the glory of my son ill is the divinity of poetry obtained if its inspired possessor is miserable in proportion to his glory ye too cherished sensibilities whose fine point is agony ye dwell not with peace kais is indeed a nightingale and leila his rose but ye have seen the minstrel of spring inhaling to ebriety its fragrant soul the more mellifluous his pathetic song the more his bosom leant on the piercing thorns ah he sings but to bleed he leans but to faint he dies on the rose in aromatic pain believe me my friends the poet the tender poet is like the rich perfume which the more it is crushed the more deliciously yields its odours is kais a superior genius envy will darken the path of his glory is it not the tree luxuriant in fruit at which we throw stones  ahmed replied the effendi the glory of yemen is kais behold him a herald of fame arises to immortalise your tribe already inscribed in characters of gold his poems are suspended on the caaba and who having read them shall dare to place his own rhymes on the same column the people echoed happy thrice happy ahmed the verses of kais give grace to thy name  but ahmed felt as a father and dropped another tear at the glory of his son  the acclamations of the people covered the declining face of kais with one blush but the pulse of his heart throbbed with a tumultuous sensation that night the sensibilities of love and fame gave to his bed a disturbed repose a thousand dreams deep in his ear yet resounded the echoes of the multitude when the glare of the sun dispersed the grateful darkness and with the darkness his thousand dreams  the exanimate frame of kais had wasted in silence he could no longer suffer separation from leila and projected means by which he could be admitted into her tent leila he well knew loved to be her own almoner and when her hand relieved her voice consoled misery had sufficiently disguised his features and melancholy had shaded his face with a religious semblance he dressed himself in the humble garb of a mevleheh dervise whose practices he had learnt the mevleheh dervises perform a public worship which consists of dancing and turning on one foot with incredible rapidity whilst a red hot iron is held between the teeth totally exhausted by pain and fatigue they fall to the ground in a senseless trance in this ceremony they are accompanied with the softest music etc  dallaways constantinople p      and approached the tent of leila to attract the attention of her slaves he whirled himself with great velocity on one foot and held a red hot iron between his teeth and sometimes with the neh or traverse flute so musically warbled his wild and enthusiastic notes that the slaves soon approached him they pitied his piety and admired his music till exhausted by pain and fatigue he fell on the earth and seemed to faint they raised the prostrate dervise and although they well remembered the blooming kais they knew not the desponding lover the dervise said he was more faint with his toiling march than his pious rite  our mistress said one of the slaves has commanded us to make her abode the tent of those who have no tent  who is thy mistress  have thou not heard of leila the beloved of kais the son of ahmed his verses have resounded in thine ear or thou have no ear for verses  tell thy mistress i heard one singing the name of leila in the desert as i passed  oh as for that they are sung every where every one who has a heart soon finds a memory for the verses of kais  the slaves returned with leila who in one hand held some pillau in a wooden platter with hot cakes taken from the living embers and in the other a bardak they put their water into bardaks or unglazed pots made of a porous earth  niebuhr vol ii p       of fair and gelid water presenting the alms to the pilgrim the dervise turned aside uttering a profound sigh leila looked in his face she knew her lover and tears burst from her eyes  how thou art miserable oh dervise she exclaimed while turning aside she whispered beloved kais how are thy features altered thine eye without a beam of beauty thy cheek without a shade of color  i was perishing for one look from thee he rereplied could thou but feel my fluttering heart how faithful its pulse do i not find thee constant speak speak calm me with thy assurance  we are watched leila answered  how terrible is thy suspicion o kais i have heard all thy verses and thou have all my sighs proceed thy journey holy dervise she raised her voice give a virgin thy prayers and i will think of thee it is believed the chaste thoughts of virgins are acceptable to heaven as the prayers of holy men  in turning away she presented her hand from behind her he impressed it with a fervent kiss and departed saying leila we shall soon meet again  this stolen interview restored kais to himself and he renewed his invention in another disguise by which he conceived he might again converse with his mistress there was not distant from her tent a green valley where the traveller would rest after bathing in its dark grove where the shining streamlet rolled between banks of oleanders and juniper shrubs kais observed at that spot under the shade of an umbrageous planetree at midday the devout mussulman after his ablutions issue from the grove spread his carpet prostrate himself and in the still small voice of piety repeat his prayers here under the luxuriant canopy of the tree he raised a temporary shed placed a small stove and dealt out his coffee to refresh the passenger he spread on his table the largest melons and the most juicy pumpkins all day our coffeedealer tinkled a tambourine and touched a santoor or psaltery singing arabian songs or recounting persian tales never yet had the keeper of a coffeeshed obtained such celebrity certainly no one was a finer musician every one resorted there to drink coffee to listen to his verses and to his tambourine and to express their surprise how such a genius should be content to boil coffee alas every one came but leila she kais at length discovered was a captive and not permitted to wander from the confines of her fathers tents as soon as he knew this he instantly left his shed standing with the coffeestove and the musical instruments affixing on it an inscription purporting that they were left for that person who though he might not acquire the glory of a musician was willing to become useful in boiling good coffee  nothing remained but the perilous expedient of penetrating into the very tent of leila since his last interview there was a gaiety in his dispositions which now induced him to assume the character of a perfumer and confectioner he filled his basket with those delicacies which might serve as bribes for the slaves of leila he appeared at the tent his basket was nicely arranged with perfumed washballs sweetscented flowers candied citrons and crystal phials of ottargul the first slave he met he presented with a perfumed washball  and how many aspers said she do thou charge for this ball  it is thine for thy black eyes kais replied and passed on  what a handsome perfumer this cried the slave as she kept her eye on the washball he met a second whose taste was attracted by his fruit  i never saw she exclaimed citrons so enormously beautiful and so deliciously candied ah they are not for a slaves tooth  take them said kais i give them to thee that thou may introduce me to the chief slave i have silks to offer the bazar of cairo has none such  i am afraid she replied thou art more handsome than generous but i thank thee for thy citrons i suppose thou meanest to gain a great deal by thy silks the old slave appeared she had a ponderous form and a hoarse voice eyeing the lovely kais abruptly she cried what smiling evil bring thou thy handsome face thy odoriferous essences and thy candied citrons are to bewilder the hearts of young slaves but me thou shall not pass my mistress is not of those who want thy pernicious luxuries she was proceeding when kais held to her a phial of schirauz glass filled with the ottargul the eye of the old slave glistened at the costly essence  that is not the true essence she cried he crushed the precious phial and the liquid odor flowed about her dress  unlucky boy she softly murmured sighing as the full and fragrant incense crept over her senses her bulky body sunk gently to the earth halfclosing her swimming eyes her quivering lips yield the feeble cry of a fainting voluptuary kais glides into the tent the orientalists are peculiarly sensible to all aromatics but the ottargul is their passion major ouseley with his accustomed elegance writes  so fond of aromatic and highlyfragrant ointments were the ancients that many writers have made their excessive indulgence in the use of perfumes the subject of learned dissertations and this with many other branches of asiatic effeminacy flowed through the surrounding nations and found their way even into greece and rome from persia or assyria the great source of eastern luxury and refinement costly and exquisite perfumes are esteemed the first among asiatic luxuries and form magnificent presents he likewise tells us on the subject of rose water  so fond are the luxurious persians of the roses delightful odor that they not only sprinkle most profusely the water distilled from its leaves but having prepared it with cinnamon and sugar they infuse it with the coffee which they drink the rose of schirauz is the most excellent of the east and the essence of it highly esteemed even in the furthest parts of india and its pure essential oil called ottargul or essence of roses is more precious than gold  in a charming letter from the abbe de lille written from greece where he traveled with m de choiseul he notices this ottar of roses sending a phial of this valued odor to a lady he writes m de choiseul entreats your acceptance of a small smellingbottle of essence of roses more roses are squeezed into this little phial than could be collected among all the gardens which i have sung     entering he beholds leila she is reciting aloud one of his poems whose volume embellished with some fanciful arabesques painted by her own hand lies unrolled before her a fine tremor runs through his frame in gazing on her and it is some moments before he can find a voice to continue the verse she begins she starts she turns she views her kais he tells her all interrupting his narrative by many an enamouring kiss the eyes of kais are brilliant with love but leila trembled with sad forebodings and she lamented how the ardour of genius had in this instance prevailed over its sagacity  beloved kais she cried thy gay magnificence betrays thy humble concealment and thou have been more generous than ingenious  but kais in the presence of his mistress forgets all danger and leila as her eyes dwelt on the longabsent face of kais talked of the peril till her words in a soft confusion murmured without meaning  in the mean while the slaves assemble round their halffainting chief who scarcely retains her senses in a reverie of odor this last munificence explained the mysterious liberalities of the unknown perfumer they now recollect his features and the alarm is spread  the greenturbaned emir rushes into the tent he views the amiable kais supporting leila one glance attaches their eyes the poem leila had been reading lies abandoned with the basket of perfumery a harsh thunder breaks over the lovers absorbed in passion it was the emirs voice they awake into consciousness scarcely has the delicious phantom of happiness taken a form ere it perishes leila shrieks her slender arms tremble round the neck of kais and her face conceals itself in his bosom while kais raises a humble yet firm regard on the emir the greenturbaned despot at first could only indicate his passion by ferocious gestures and with eyes red with rage and lips quivering without articulation his foot violently spurned at the basket of perfumery that lay at the feet of leila while his hand grasping the immortal poem tore the roll powdered with gold dust and scattered the perfumed and painted manuscript in the air the persians are very fond of elegant mss all their favorite works are generally written upon fine silky paper the ground of which is often powdered with gold or silver dust the two first leaves are commonly illuminated and the whole book is sometimes perfumed with essence of roses or sandal wood the poem of joseph and zuleikha which we have already noticed in the public library at oxford is perhaps the most beautiful ms in the world the margins of every page are gilt and adorned with garlands of flowers and the handwriting is elegant to the highest degree the ink of the asiatics is extremely black and never loses its color and the egyptian reeds with which they write are formed to make the finest strokes and flourishes  sir w joness pers gram   at length his foaming lips found a voice is it then with perfumes that the magnificent kais bribes is it with a song that he deludes a simple virgin and thou have dared to steal into the tent of an emir shall the plunderer of caravans pollute with his impious embraces the descendant of fatima spirit of mahomet will thou that our glory end in a foolish maiden a soulless being who has yielded her heart because her ear is musical  leila had fallen to the ground she covered her face with her hands and her lips touched the sandals of her father impelled by sympathy kais inconsciously prostrated himself but with an air of dignity and in a tone not accordant with his softening words the suppliant lover spoke   noble emir deem not that the passion of thy daughter has been obtained by the incantation of words ere i yet knew to give cadence to a verse our sighs responded believe me we are none of those who have spoken of love ere we loved our passion was not kindled by the lightning of a glance nor maddened by a set of features it was a pure pleasure that we first caught from the perfection of mind our thoughts mingled and our hopes rose ere we felt the distinction of sex and leila was as my sister ere i loved her as my mistress is there a passion so invincible as that of love formed almost in childhood nature then adds to our inclinations her own sweet habitudes and it becomes as it were a double passion and shall a father tear his daughter from an embrace that nature has made holy  descendant of fatima is humility held to be a vice in thy race come not the noblest race from the humblest origin the lovely fountain of juvencia hides not its head among flowers and sunshine but amidst rushes and darkness the great prophet like myself was of an obscure birth and arrogance never marked the cameldriver noble emir thy father was a son of peace my father is a son of war honor wreathed thy cradle opulence pillowed the bed of my infancy thou were born illustrious i to become illustrious the glory of thy race devolved to thee the glory of mine proceeds from me  is the difference essential smile but on the son of ahmed and behold we are both illustrious  the haughty emir disdainfully glanced on the pleading lover and marking his perfumers dress replied  deceiver of the eye thou can only triumph over a woman nor honor nor dishonor proceed from the sex who are born only to dress to prattle and to procreate robber of the desert return for ever return to thy father and tell him that i have suffered thee to exist  while the proud father spoke kais had gradually changed his supplicatory posture and when his invective closed stood before him erect in dignity he replied but by a silent glance so fraught with a conscious superiority that the appalled despot shrunk with receding steps into the midst of his people there he ordered to secure leila she lay on the ground abandoned to grief and uttered a loud shriek kais turning toward her they exchanged glances despair writhed the soft features of leila her eyes were haggard and her arms stretched to her lover passion pity and indignation struggled in the breast of kais he grasped her hand once more he felt it on his lips torn from his contending arms their eyes parted not till at the extremity of the tent he saw her disappear and in silent agony he for some time fixed his eyes on that extremity watching the wavy motions of the tent and catching every dancing shadow every undulation of light his fixed glance was terrible and one might perceive by its ardour and the emotions of his gestures that he still thought he was conversing with the departed leila  at length a slow and deep sigh heaved his breast he struck with his clenched hands his burning temples that throbbed as he pressed them he paced vehemently around the tent and then pausing as if a sudden passion had changed his emotions he flung himself on the ground and there more mild more subdued more tender he poured copious tears and allconscious of the past scene he again prostrated himself and again stretched his suppliant hands he shuddered as the horrid silence only returned his melancholy voice he raised his eyes and beheld himself in solitude  already through the tents of the emir the fate of our lovers was known the fame of kais accompanied him wherever he went and wherever the poet wandered he found in his admirers sympathising companions scarcely was the event known than the public anxiety turned entirely on their cherished bard they assembled in haste and were divided into little knots of people among them was an hoary traveller who was distinguished by a tuft of plaited hair which when it hung loose trailed on the ground and he wore it wrapped about his head instead of a turban what was remarkable it was not his own hair but formed of the relics of his friends from every one of whom he had affectionately collected a handful of hair which he had interwoven with his own it was in this manner the traveller had memorised their affections this singular form of expressing the sensibility of friendship is recorded in bells travels to china and was employed by an old and virtuous bramin   whenever this old man spoke every one was silent and now being observed to have risen the little knots of people immediately melted into one crowd and assembled around him he waved his hand and stilled their generous confusion he spoke  let us weep for leila all our days for what hope awaits the daughter of a merciless sire but for kais we must do something more than weep for he is so much the unhappier that he is at liberty to wander ah where will kais wander he will lie down in the stony desert till he forgets himself to stone but he has all the vehemence of genius ah then he may grow wild kind heaven preserve the poet from madness  a hundred voices exclaimed let us hasten to kais  friends continued the venerable man if ye crowd around the enthusiast ye will seem to intrude on his grief he will gaze on ye as if ye came in mockery ye will make wildness more wild such is the tremulous bosom of genius when once its generous feelings are injured it becomes suspicious and misanthropical trust me i was once the companion of a poet and i have learnt to reverence the sorrows of divine men solitude alone soothes their sublime souls would ye heal his hurted spirit indulge it would ye soften his melancholy let a friend participate it would ye console the wretchedness of the sensitive being let him feel that there is one who has made that wretchedness his own i am old but the nerves of my heart are tender as infancy when it first receives the ambient air that wounds it i too have been a poet i too have had my griefs let me conduct the wanderer to the tents of his father he will not quit me though my steps are feeble and the journey long no he will not quit me for he shall take no perception of time while over the toiling path of the enthusiast my tongue shall spread its innocent deceit in discoursing of leila and of nature the inspirers of his verse  the hoary sage enters the tent he views kais on the ground his hands covering his face his arms resting on one knee while the other was violently writhed behind him torture and despair were in his attitude the old man crept along in silence and stood before him kais raised his eyes on the reverend form he spoke not the old man was silent kais again covered his face with his hands and the old man sighed kais looked in his face there were tears in the wrinkles of his cheek kais stretched his hand to the old man and their hands were joined  is not age spared in these ruthless tents said kais i have grief enough to make youth grow old in a day but what grief is thine venerable man that can give to thy pithless age the scalding tear of youth  the venerable man replied  kais divine youth i am a lover of thy verses often have thy emotions made my breast more capacious and now i see thee how must i weep for thee thou know the eyes of age distill not artificial tears whom has an old man to flatter we have nothing more to hope but alla be praised i have not outlived my humanity it is for kais i sigh  good old man i thank thee never till now have i found pleasure in the sigh of an old man do thou know where they have hurried leila  the eyes of kais turned wildly to the extremity of the tent  kais will thou accept the consolation of a fraternal heart who knows not leila who remembers not thy verses and much have i to talk of the blooming maid but rest not in these tents thy father mourns thy absence  thou have spoken well said kais already had i forgotten my father and my friends a mild subdued tone of sorrow expressed his gratitude  thou have spoken well it befits me not to rest here a helpless sufferer  waving his hand he rose slowly his eye kindled and pausing as he stepped along he cried  i will hasten to my tents i will call three thousand faithful bedoweens their sabres will fly from their sheaths sabres ah what have i said leila would never pardon the murderer of her father the father of leila may spurn at the degraded kais for while he treats me as he treats leila shall i murmur love has made me like the sandal tree which sheds sweetness on the axe that wounds it i thank thee old man i will not return to my father i will sit here contemned and abandoned  indulging the rapid changes of his disordered mind the old man at length lured him from the tent of the haughty emir he talked as he journeyed of leila and his verses and through the solaced ear of kais awoke the finest vibrations of his harmonious heart love and glory seemed to accompany the steps of the enamoured poet the old man one day pulled down his lengthened hair and telling him at times as he pointed at the intermingled tresses of the many histories it remembered him he entreated a handful from the locks of kais that he might still add another relic to the tender memorial of friendship  i have chosen he said a pilgrims path in life because it is pleasantly diversified and i did not choose that the stream of my life should be a stagnant pool but a river wandering in sunshine and in shade the occupation of my life has been to acquire the friendship of great and of good men with every one i found some new talent of the mind or virtue of the heart and my intelligence was enlarged and my emotions became more pure i have repeated my existence in that of my friend and i have preferred the passion of friendship to that of love for friendship can be participated but love has but one object friendship is a torch which will light other torches without wasting itself but love like a sepulchral lamp is extinguished in the solitary tomb  kais sighed and after a pause of thought replied  i had a heart and i could not help loving the most lovely she was as amber and i but as straw she touched me and i shall ever cling to her amber attracts straw the idea is persian sir john chardin in a song he has translated has a lover who tells his mistress  the pale languor of your complexion is the amber that attracts the straw  thou can not blame my affection for leila she took my young heart in her hand and breathed over it her mind created my mind and to render me worthy of herself she first taught me the love of glory i was once in the bath and they gave me a piece of scented clay this is a kind of unctuous clay which the persians persume with essence of roses and use in the baths instead of soap the application is from sadi  it was more than fragrant and i asked of it  art thou pure musk or ambergris for thy scent delights my soul it answered  i was but common earth till i lived in the company of my rose then every day i became sweeter till all her aromatic spirit was infused into mine oh had i not lived with my rose i should still have been but a lump of earth  they reach the tents of ahmed and the rejoicing bedoweens crowd around their returning lord while the old man hastens to the venerable chief to relate the afflictions of kais the eyes of the mother of kais are filled with maternal tears ahmed frowned at the ignoble artifice of his son he starts at the contumely he suffered and impatiently draws his sabre but his aged arm trembles with feebleness and anger and the sabre drops he calls his son  kais kais have thou lost the glory of our tribe for a woman avenge me on an insulting enemy take the sabre my childish arm can no more wield  kais sighed  i cannot strike at the father of leila  degenerate youth in the balance of life thou weighest beauty against honor thou have become a metim an arabic term for the captive of love one who submits to slavery or the meanest employment to have an opportunity of serving or admiring his mistress  mahomet have thou given me a son to crush thy servant to his grave what ablution have i neglected what ramazan have i broken when i have trod a parched soil with parched lips i made myself a race and lo a son has come like the pestilence of cairo i will strike my tents disperse ye happy bedoweens seek other vales for here your lord was born and here first ye have known dishonor  distraction was in the soul of kais the reproaches of his father and the inalterable affection for leila raged with a force equal and opposed he sunk before him he embraced his knees the voice of ahmed was stifled by his emotions he raised his hand to repulse his fainting son but in touching his face it trembled and it dwelt there the mother of kais bent on one knee to support her son while one hand was locked in the hand of her venerable hero the crowded tent was moved the low hollow murmurs of the sympathising bedoweens were heard it was an electrified silence they gently separate the son from the father and the mother themselves clung to each other without motion like a sculptured groupe  retired the sensibilities of kais assumed all their energy and the passions divided his soul love with seducing blandishment honor with a more solemn but feebler power and glory obscurely breaking in a distant age but memory affectionate memory awoke that domestic tenderness which is the rival of love itself as he thought of his parents he paused in the tumult of his heart  have ye not adored my infancy he cried have ye not reared me to glory was i not the treasured hope of your age yes i was that futurity to ye which can render every passing day even precious to old age i was the pride of a brave father the existence of a tender mother and now shall one passion eradicate all passions  he recoils from the terrible thought he hastens to throw himself on the paternal bosom leila rises in his reverie imaged in softness constant in affection and celestial in her virgin beauty he groans he weeps and throws himself on the earth  he sat motionless and mute and abstracted his companions glided into his tent each studious to win him from dejection but with various men he was still the same man there was no life in his fixed and glazed eye save at times a lingering tear that hermitlike stole solitary from its cell his mother sat beside him in silence her eye followed his eye sometimes he sat in the vertical sun insensible of the unmitigated day till his mother with his favorite gazel followed him while often unobserved by kais above his head she twined the adorning tamarind that waved its shade before his tent with the luxuriant boughs of the indian fig tree the gazel would frequently lift her tender eyes on him but her looks were unnoticed she would lick his hand till she awakened him from his reverie for a moment he fixed his eyes on her waved his head and gently turned her away at times he chaunted incoherent verses rambling from thought to thought with a wild and pathetic sweetness ever he descanted on the eternity of love while the sad return of his lay still repeated the ruthless nature of fathers his melancholy was yet mild and while his heart bled it seemed patient  another change succeeded from a total stupor to the passing scene he awoke to its minutest perception he not only saw what was before him but through the vividness of imagination he saw more of every one suspicious but most of his suffering mother ever beside him he remembers syllables he meditates on gestures sometimes a sense of his dishonor stole across his mind he felt how love had defrauded him of glory every passion however was transient but that passion every object failed to impress his mind but the image of leila to his visionary eye that form was brilliant in the light of the sun and that form moved among the waving shadows of the moon  he could no longer support the eye of the world in his tortured sensations his language was inhuman he called his mother the wife of his father but no relative of her child and he surlily dismissed his friends one by one for capricious but inveterate dislikes sometimes his anger was loquacious his taunt bitter his repartee caustic while at times he was obstinately mute but his silence concealed not the disorder of his intellect for then the vacillations of his countenance and the glistening and rapid movements of his eye expressed his phrenzy  restless even to agony melancholy even to fondness romantic even to delirium the world weighed heavy on his heart that world he shook off lightly and in a quiet despair stole away from all humanity  the full moon hung over the tent of kais in a flood of light he stole from his tent listening to his own footsteps he gazed nothing moved but the gliding shadows in the vast silence heaven and earth reposed the moonlight scenery touched his melancholy heart in its semiday he views the tall tents part frosted over by its white beams part illumined by a yellower light  blessed moon cried kais in thy reposing light every thing is perceptible while i am unperceived sweet and tempered light how thou penetratest my heart how thou drawest the tears from mine eyes  he starts he hears approaching sounds  it is exclaimed the melancholy and fanciful kais but the zephyr kissing the reverend head of that tall palm tree that nods while each solitary leaf finds a voice in such a silence  still some footsteps disturb the visionary  they have tracked me he cried he turned round he beholds his favorite gazel that had followed him he kisses her beautiful eyes he gazes on the sensibility of her physiognomy he fancies she sighs and he weeps over her neck  tender companion he cries return to the abandoned tent of thy master o thou who have the eyes of leila pierce not my soul with thy intendering look entice me not to return domestic beauty dwell in the hollow and green bosom of the valley ah let not thy form of delicate elegance thy slender silver feet thy dark brilliant eyes lively and timid as thou art follow an exile for trust me beauty will perish with despair for its fellowwanderer  again he embraces his mute friend a big tear rolled down the brown forehead of the antelope  thou weepest who weeps for kais but his gazel let us part fly me thou were created to live the day of pleasure mine has closed the antelope persisted in following the footsteps of his delirious master and they escape from the pastoral scenes of the happy arabia and wander in the stony soil of the desert  scarcely had the sun risen ere the wakeful mother of kais hastened as of late accustomed to her sons tent she enters and she shrieks they fly to her from the near tents and the venerable ahmed was not among the last  miserable being cried the mother to ahmed behold thy son flown from thy ruthless austerity have thou murdered my child yet yet be kind and send thy sabre to my bosom a mother should not survive the loss of her adored child alas all has past for me i bear no other children in my womb hot are the tears that scorch the cheeks of a mother left without offspring but i weep not oh ahmed thou have given me the grief that is not relieved by tears  fond despairing woman feebly exclaimed the old chief sobbing convulsively as the ideas of his own austerity and his sons despair fell on his mind like repeated concussions he turned aside to pray to the prophet but his gestures only were his orisons tears welled on his pale cheeks and all that he was heard to say was alla thou art great it is now a month i have not seen my son  and i have watched my son hour by hour exclaimed the distracted mother  yesterday as i marked the moving vacancy of his eye suddenly he uttered a scream of laughter my heart died within me and he turned to me with a bitter smile my son i cried and he turned from me he turned from me kais is delirious my son is lost cruel fathers ye have not the hearts of mothers ye have not known what it was to kiss the infant being that formed a part of your existence that lived on your own bosom where wanders my child give me my child lead me to kais let me perish but let my child live  they convey the distracted mother to her tent while ahmed instantly sent a messenger to the retreat of the effendi before he could give orders to his faithful bedoweens to seek after kais their zeal had already dispersed them in every direction ahmed now withdrew to his tent to preserve rigid fasts and uninterrupted prayer that he might win with the gentle violence of devotion the prophet who seemed to have forsaken him  scarcely had the effendi listened to the messenger of ahmed than clasping his hands he would not suffer him to conclude the recital of his message  i understand he cried more than thou can relate prepare thy dromedary he was silent during the journey and although the dromedary went on with its painful gallop several times he complained of the sluggishness of the animal  he arrives he falls at the feet of ahmed he looks in his face and gently waves his head the venerable chief understood him raising him he exclaimed  virtuous sage speak enlighten but do not silently reproach  alas i only can feel for thee  such a son the flower and the sabre of my tribe lebid is the fault mine that the greenturbaned emir is no father could i mitigate the immitigable i have lived a life of honor could i suffer a day of obloquy as for myself my days are but few yet if the cold blood that heavily creeps round my heart could satiate the imperious emir i would spill it at his feet would he but write the contract of my sons nuptials with the blood of the father  the aged effendi grasped the hand of the veteran chief  we are said he both old men but we will both die for kais my heart is feeble now my head is white and my eye weeps but this is not strange it is the falling of the snow on the hills that makes the streams flow an arabian image taken from richardsons arabic grammar   end of part the first part the second let us track the wanderings of the delirious and poetic kais with his constant gazel following and never preceding him he conversed with it untired his feeling heart ever wanted something to be kind to and if he had not found an antelope in the desert he would have felt an affection for a sheltering tree  poor gazel cried kais affectionately stroking its fallow back and smoothing its silvery down thou love to course with me a toiling road and thy slender feet can creep along in the slow steps of a man unblest i pray thee look not so pensively tender with the sweet seriousness of thy black eyes my heart is so full of sorrow that thy gentle glance in ruffling it makes it overflow straining his eye balls he turns toward home he cries  cherished valley i quit thee i hurry from thee i have madly left thee yet thou have my tears i cannot any more see thee but i weep over thee oh there i had friends there i was loved and there  no there i could love no one oh leila leila soul of my body i neither fly from thee nor to thee but i am tossed in distraction sweet native soil how my heart outjourneys my eye and how it lingers about thee while every step removes me still farther and farther into a desert  to elude his pursuers he had left the open desert and climbed among the rocks making himself paths where eagles rested as yet mild in his volitions and yet not insensible to the pointed flint to the sultry thirst of his parched lips to the rage of hunger and to the exhaustion of travel in the gray and briny sands but every day his withering frame became less penetrable to the terrible elements his feet acquired the stoniness of the rocks he trod and he leaped careless from abyss to abyss while the torrid sun burnt on his naked head and his tongue often hanging from his mouth felt no thirst sensation in him had reached that exquisite degree of pain in which pain ceases to be felt deliriously he sat on the pyramid of some rock where he seemed to inhabit the solitude of heaven viewing nothing but the desert of air  yet on earth the desert frequently was not a solitude there sometimes he imagined he heard at distance human voices laughing and mocking at him and often he raged indignant at their cruelty nor seemed to know that these were the howlings and shrill cries of assembled jackals who during the night yielded their most distressful and continued tones in the night we were disturbed by the incessant cries of the jackals which are the most distressful imaginable they collect in packs amongst the ruins of ephesus the foxes of sampson were jackals and ought to be so translated wherever they are mentioned in scripture jeremiah describing the present desolation of the holy city has this very striking image now verified of ephesus  zion is desolate the foxes walk upon it  dallaways constantinople p        at times he viewed winging the air with a rushing sound the eagles darting from the crags that soared and screeched above him he listened to the ravens hoarsely croaking while sometimes the clangor of a flock of cranes closely wedged was heard sailing in the air when all was quiet and his exhausted heart itself reposed his eye would follow the changeful cameleon that sensible of its security slowly changed its natural color while if kais approached it escaped with agility varying its agitated body with rapid and tremulous hues mr dallaway describes in his comtantinople among other picturesque scenery the cameleon basking on the scars as enjoying perfect security changing its color or escaping with wonderful agility perhaps it changes its color on occasions of fear or anger the natural color is iron gray which it can vary with every shade of brown and yellow    over the plain bounded on all sides by the horizon he found no intervening object to rest on and his eye ached as it passed over a level and shining waste of gray sand and scorched brambles in the uniform deadness of the dreary landscape there was no vestige of animation no bird flew in the empty air no animal trod no lizard crawled on the earth and he felt himself alone in the universe yet sometimes was this sultry silence broken as he listened to a troop of camels with the tinkling chimes of their bells mingled with the heavy hum of the drowsy songs of the drivers and swelling in the stillness of the breeze while sometimes an object pleasingly picturesque a caravan took new forms as it wound its slow length along the rocks at times the whole body disappeared and then gradually emerged and then was partly concealed till the camels the wagon and the travelers alike melted away in the aerial distances  his nerves are shaken his ideas through inanition and fatigue are confused and bewildered a fever wastes his adust frame he grazed on the pale brown herbage of the desert with his gazel recited verses at intervals which marked his unsettled emotions every where he seemed to seek destruction and could find it no where at his lucid intervals he examined his form and shuddered reflecting on the past he seemed to have performed impossible things and often he relapsed into delirium while he reflected he had been delirious  meanwhile the bedoweens returned from the desert in opposite directions and some assured that they had at times tracked the path of kais for they had perceived the small steps of the gazels slender feet intermixed with those of its master but these again they had as suddenly lost the mother of kais was wild in her sorrow ahmed could not support the presence of his beloved mourner and he resolved himself to wander with a band of faithful followers till they had discovered the retreat of kais embracing the effendi he said  thou art not a man of despair and thou shall be buried in a valley for wretches like me a desert has a charm for it promises death  the effendi pressed his hand and without replying accompanied the unhappy father  one moon had elapsed and hitherto the old ahmed had been only consoled by reciting passages from the koran and listening as he journeyed to the verses of lebid  but age grief and fatigue exhausted the frame of the venerable chief they had now been traveling on the briny fands and had not seen a tree or a shrub for many days while more than once they had observed the carcass of a camel and parched adders stiffened in death nothing was heard but their own voices nothing had life but themselves  how dead is this earth exclaimed ahmed ah if i could see but one living tree although buffon was not so well supplied as ourselves with eastern descriptions yet genius knows to describe justly with a paucity of facts he finely observes in his concise picture of an arabian desert that there the traveller na jamais respire sur lombrage rien ne laccompagne rien ne lui rappelle la nature vivante solitude absolve mill fois plus affreuse que celle des forets ear les arbres sont encore des etres pour lhomme  vol x p     vo     the air was red and fiery and the sky sparkled and the hot sands flew about them they were now the victims of the most parching thirst at night they stretch their tunics on the earth that they might be imbued by the nightdews and which in the morning they pressed to moisten their lips still to exalt their sufferings in a long series of thirst their agitated and torturing imaginations recalled to them the ideas of bursting springs and running brooks till in their feverish emotions they called out to each other in agony at length they heard waters trickling among some whispering bulrushes delicious sound some throw themselves on the earth and some creep along on bended knees among the reeds and with difficulty collect a little water in a large vase they bring the cooling wave to slake their old masters parched mouth his eager hand trembles as it holds the precious draught he bends his hoary head and dashes it to the earth the acrid water hung in bitterness on his baffled lips both the old men were fainting in the hot blasts and they administered to them garlic and dried grapes to revive them the arabians when they travel carry with them garlic and dried grapes for the purpose of reviving such persons as may fall down fainting from the effect of the hot blasts  pages travels   more formidable terrors awoke the colossal horrors of the desert columns of sand which nature animated sometimes stalked with a sublime grandeur and sometimes appeared to pursue them with celerity with hearts coiled by fear and eyes halfcurious and dismayed they watched these separate whirlwinds at times they met they broke and instantly the convulsed mountains whose heads were buried in the clouds dispersed darkening the heavens while at times the sun seemed a globe of fire in the crimson atmosphere the little caravan quailed at length they rejoiced to have reached a new desolation it was a body of hanging rocks of which some were broken and spread in vast ruins while the rude arches showed only one horrific night to have entered them might have chilled the heart of a hermit but they blessed the central darkness which offered them a retreat from the desertwhirlwinds and some lighting their torches cautiously entered  let me rest here exclaimed the feebletoned ahmed as he grasped the hand of lebid let the wild lion meet us here i will grapple with him hope is extinct with the spirit of my life my wife i shall no more embrace my son i shall never behold lebid my skin is dry my pulse is weak and my heart is torpid a cold thirst has seized on my vitals i have bled in the field but with open wounds never have i felt a thirst like this lebid i am desperate with misery the light of the day is hateful to my eyes i see nothing in this vast space but an immense sepulcher  venerable chief replied the effendi thy heroic spirit is crushed not by the elements but by thy passions thy soul is more desolate than the desert it is the father who unnerves the warrior  they had now retreated within these tremendous masses of rock and had passed several hours in these unhewed temples of nature when a bedoween discovered on a height a kind of bridge formed by the trunk of a tree so lightly flung across the scarcevisible points of two projecting precipices that it seemed to hang in the air pointing it out to the effendi his aged eyes could not perceive it  reverend effendi said the bedoween you may observe it if you will look on the sky the bridge is next to the sky  i see it it is a fearful height a bridge there despair only could have been its architect what man is he who wants a passage on that dizzy point  be sure said the bedoween it is not of mortal contrivance i will arm and watch it  the pallid moon tinged with a discolored and uncertain gleam the vast solitude on the acclivities of the rocks when the watchful bedoween heard above him the sound of pacing steps at length a human voice broke out chaunting in fantastic measures while at times it liquified the heart with many a pathetic tone on the narrow bridge hanging next the sky a naked spectreform flitted along so wan so woebegone so shadowy it seemed an unblessed spirit a gazel followed the fading apparition  the trembling and pale bedoween hastened to his lord and described the vision  i have seen he cried a mejnoun this surname in arabic means a maniac but sometimes an enthusiast and a man inspired  is not this a proof of the universality of the notion that inspiration is a species of insanity the amabilis insania of horace  the orientals observes m cardonne do not consider madness as so great an evil as we europeans nor is it so liable to reproach they think that it may only be an error or in the language of dr darwin an hallucination of the mind or perhaps a gentle inebriation which though it troubles the order of our ideas may soften our pangs as likely as augment them it is only when insanity is furious that it excites horror   thou look as if thyself were bewildered said ahmed  perhaps my lord i am i am not longlived be sure for i have seen a spirit twas on the bridge next to the sky twas a form so transparent the moonbeams pierced it the tones were not of earth they were aerial as the voice of gabriel to the prophet a gazel followed wondrous the spirit of a gazel  thine eyes are credulous thou said at first he was but a mejnoun  true true my lord he is but a mejnoun how came i to think of a spirit yet my lord my eyes are not credulous my ears were witnesses to my eyes i heard verses from the mejnoun and the moon shone so sweetly i could not help weeping  be calm and concise  what verses did thou hear inquired the effendi  fine and distracted verses changing their measures always beginning but never finishing he spoke to the moon and i looked up at the moon and my ear drank every sound with such ecstasy that i only remember one verse which describes the mejnoun himself  i am a shade  but grief has given a voice   alla is great exclaimed the effendi thy son lives ahmed and the mejnoun is kais well i remember that verse it was but an image of fiction and now dear youth thy genuine tears fall over thy fictitious sorrows enthusiast of nature and have thou become a mejnoun has thy subtle spirit preyed on itself and have thy passions so vehement and vast flamed into delirium  the sudden discovery oppressed ahmed his lips quivered the color left his blanched cheeks and the word mejnoun faltered in his throat he fainted in the arms of an attendant  the affectionate band assemble at the foot of the rocks which kais haunted watching his return in a breathless anxiety he came stalking over the narrow plank followed by the gazel with steps as solemn the moon shone against him illumining his form while at his back was a dark sky he seemed a being not earthly and material  god of my fathers exclaimed ahmed it is my son aid me my friends let me reach him let me die at his feet shall i see this and shall i suffer existence  let me replied the old effendi feebly restraining the feeble old chief let me listen to him if he replies not to my voice and if he knows not this desert he is delirious if he knows my voice and descends not he is insane dr darwin in his zoonomia thus distinguishes delirium from madness  the ideas in delirium consist of those excited by the sensation of pleasure or pain which precedes them and the trains of other ideas associated with these and not of those excited by external or by voluntary exertion hence the patients do not know the room which they inhabit or the people who surround them nor have they any voluntary exertion when the delirium is complete so that their efforts in walking about a room or rising from their bed are unsteady and produced by their catenations with the immediate affections of pleasure or pain by the above circumstances it is distinguished from madness in which the patients well know the persons of their acquaintance and the place where they are and perform all the voluntary actions with steadiness and determination     ahmed abruptly interrupting the effendi cried  follow me faithful bedoweens or i will go alone i feel i can perform impossible things what the timid cannot conceive i will climb i will perish his mother shall not again reproach me with leaving her childless  the gliding shade of kais or the mejnoun as we shall now call him stood lower among the rocks he looked down on the valley unconscious of its objects his father started calling on him affectionately kais replied not but turning to his gazel patted its downy back and they both sat down the mejnoun broke out into the following soliloquy  why were the blue heavens rolled out and the earth made green and man an unhappy wanderer the storm sleeps in the blue heaven the pestilence sweeps the green earth why is not the human fugitive like the fruittree maturing in its cradle diffusing its blossoms in its native air and dropping its treasures on the earth that nourishes it lo the tree lives its planter protects it his hand will medicate it his eye will weep over it but who has planted thee man thou tree of evil growth are not the fruits thou bear even poisonous to the roots of thy being and do not thy passions circulate in thy veins till they consume that existence to which they gave birth foolish man thou think this world made for thee when all around thee bears the image of thy fleeting existence can thou dissimulate this idea lo in the pleasure thou graspest thou feel the beginnings of pain eternal mockery of pleasure repose in the verdant shade and wake with the circling adder over the midnight bower as they laugh and drink unprofaned wine lo the invisible pestilence creeps in one little hour and rages in their nostrils breathing odours and hangs on their lips tinged with the liquid purple and the morning comes and the sun shines and the city is desolate oh heaven and earth was this creation made in sport who art thou the creator  he ceased this delirious rhapsody and lebid replied  this heaven with its softened beauty before thee and thou ask where is thy god this glowing earth rejoicing with painted forms and thou can not trace him at one touch was this web of being woven i look around and know my god as when i examine the traces left on the sands i perceive whether a man or an animal has passed behold the eternals road is it not one path of prodigies thine eye can view the vestiges of the divinity  meditate on all around thee and question thy soul is it not touched by the harmonies of nature but the great artist conceals himself and is only viewed in his work art thou then not satisfied with the mild glory so suited and so proportioned to thine eye would thou penetrate into the designs of the divinity let man then ride within the whirlwind let his hands pour out the sunshine and let his feet stamp on the unsteady ocean  ingenious only in creating thine own infelicity it is thy reason which renders thee unreasonable and thy intelligence unintelligent or rather it is thy pride that tells thee thy reason must be the reason of god and thy capacity his power thou have concluded that thou art on the height of this vast chain of creation thou who know not why the tides ebb and flow how a blade of grass becomes perfect and why the dead seed thou throwest in the earth becomes an animated being trust me the spirit of god is too subtle for the spirit of man  there was one day a sage who sought to discover the essence of the godhead he began at morn and in the evening he still leant not undelighted by the charm of thought his friend approached him and softly stealing him from the dream of meditation exclaimed  how long thou have loitered in the garden of thy mind what lovely flowers have thou collected  the sage replied  my soul has been flying toward heaven and for you and my friends i filled my folded robe with celestial flowers but as i grasped them for at times i thought i grasped them i fainted over the too exquisite odours and my folded robe fell from my relaxing hands and my collected flowers are for ever dispersed  it is thus we lose ourselves in researches after the secrets of god the most curious are not the most knowing scarcely do the sages perceive the divinity but death closes their lips yes believe me the paths of heaven are only penetrated by the wings of a seraph the latter part of the reply of lebid in the allegorical manner of the easterns describing the too subtle nature of such researches is taken from sadis gulistan the remaining passage is translated by major ouseley from nizami one of the sublimest of the persian poets  and can thou tell despairing man what is to happen tomorrow or that which shall yet remain in obscurity can we tell the man whose affairs fortune shall direct or him with whose life destiny shall sport can we point out him who tomorrow shall be brought forth a lifeless corpse from his habitation or him on whose brow posterity shall place a diadem who knows on this clay which we now trample under foot what blood of heroes may have been shed   the mejnoun listened and paused and still recurring in his mind to his own situation gave his thought in verse as some light wave that finds no calm repose still urged from rock to rock in madness glows lo from the wildinfracted passage fled it steals in murmurs to a desertbed so let him fly whose soft and hurted mind has strove with human rocks  a world unkind   lebid sought in his mind for some image to soothe the despairing mourner and replied and i have seen believe the moral tale a rent bough wandering with the various gale the smiling meads the laughing valleys fly and seek the stream with faded leaves to die when lo a genial earth the plant receives and over the pilgrim breathes a youth of leaves so often some wanderer pale whose hopeless eye can see no oulloved friends or sees them fly has found by time or chance new pleasures rise and felt the refuge sweet of kinder skies   the mejnoun listened till in his intense attention he ceased almost to breathe it seemed the voice and the verse of lebid in an awful pause he appeared collecting his returning ideas the verses were consolatory and the voice was cherished the tenderest associations of thought melted together at the memory of lebid for yet the hermits heart was not dead to the emotions of friendship the latent fires of his soul were but covered and wanted but the lightest air to be awakened  surely he exclaimed that voice is the voice of lebid  a soft shower of tears covered his face he leant from the rock in the still and unwavering light of the moon shone palely the venerable form of his friend and his master he rushed down the rock murmuring and exclaiming in sweet and tender tones as he went he reaches the plain and throws himself at the feet of lebid  lebid stood alone a little removed behind him was the silent band the assembly was touched and a low tremulous murmur of sympathy just broke the stilness they sighed at the view of the wan and desolated figure it was scarcely that of humanity of his vestments but a few loose remnants remained that fluttered as they clung to his skeleton body his copious tresses that still covered his shoulders were matted and clotted his nails had grown hard sharp and long and with them he had armed himself to tear the birds and the smaller prey which he hunted and fed on by a natural impulse his once fine physiognomy was stained with a copper hue and his expressive dark eyes looked now haggard and sparkled with an incessant motion  at the feet of lebid the mejnoun first spoke  art thou like myself unblest a scatterling scatterling spenser is a venerable authority for this word it means a vagabond one that has no home or settled habitation johnson says it is an elegant word but disused the french express such a character by saying quil na ni feu ni lieu  dropped off from the race of man to howl along the desert to sleep on dizzy precipices and to be invulnerable to the thousand deaths around alas the miserable never die i once thought grief had its gangrene it would spread and kill in parting from the world let us unite thou can curse an unfeeling world can thou not i will sit beside thee and i will bless thee oh it is long that i have loved a curser and i will tell thee all that has passed between leila and myself thou know not all heaven only knows all it is a wondrous tale old man that will melt thy wintery eyes and make thy heart while it sits amidst desolation beat with a human pulse  leila lives replied the effendi straining the mejnoun to his breast she lives to blame thee for deserting the tents of thy father yes leila lives continued the effendi as he thought the mejnoun paused as if doubtful of it  the mejnoun still paused then with a deep sigh he exclaimed in the sweetest tone ah leila leila  the effendi continued  and thy father lives  the mejnoun starting raved in voluble passion and rapidly said  the tents of fathers are not any more the tents for their children nature is weary with repeating simple affections affections old as this antique world now she loves to create monsters to people the world with a hideous race of men and teaches fathers to be the only enemies of their children  the old ahmed hitherto restrained by his attendants struggled to get to his son but his steps trembled and he fell at his feet he clung to his knees and looking on him as if his heart were breaking he cried  my son behold thy poor father thy poor father my son do thou not know thy poor father  mejnoun gazing on him with a vacant eye slowly crept away shuddering and turning to lebid in a low whisper who is here who is he who talks of my father it was a cruel mockery to emind me of my father  lebid is my father coming  be secret i know to creep to the pinnacle of yon rock and if my father should come i would laugh at him on the point of the precipice  he was retreating among the rocks when lebid arrested him and exclaimed  mejnoun thy father calls thee scarcely is he thy father so wasted and so wretched  if my father is here replied mejnoun with a solemn accent tell him i forgive him we must never meet brings he persecution even in the desert it will be short i will say a last prayer to the prophet and steal away to a glorious abyss i have kept it for a last refuge i have at times felt happy when i thought me of that abyss it is happiness to know how easily we can elude our persecutor often has my eye measured the tremendous chasm it is fathomless and i despair  his whole frame was now agitated a liquid fire glowed in his quick and vivid eyes and a terrible energy was in his gestures he continued  thou see i am calm sometimes i think i am mad leila leila must i see every one but thee  his teeth chattered he howled he stamped on the earth he tore a handful of hair from his head he hastened up the rocks and was seized by the bedoweens  they placed him on a camel his father and the effendi followed during the journey the complete delirium of mejnoun seemed to hinder him from any voluntary exertion of ideas or of actions he did not appear to perceive that he was surrounded by people or that he was carried on a camel stretched for hours in reverie he would at times hold a selfdialogue seeming to reply to what he imagined some one conversed with him sometimes he carolled wild tender verses and now he shrieked and now he laughed sometimes he attempted to rise and wander but feeling himself confined by some superior power he groaned and sunk down without discerning the violence offered to him  thy son is not insane observed the effendi to ahmed he is only delirious his soul is so penetrated with his unhappy passion that it only exists to that solitary conception and his ideas are consistent as they relate to that sole object were he a maniac he would recognize us and would distinguish the camel on which he is laid and all his voluntary actions would proceed from erroneous ideas an hallucination of the mind in which he would mistake his vivid imaginations for existing realities then he would not as he does now publicly disclose the inmost emotions of his soul but on the contrary he would be suspicious of those who were near him in his actions wary in his designs cunning at this moment we behold him insensible of the actual scene and the sole object of leila concentrating all his faculties and all his sensations  the old ahmed waved his majestic head and without replying looked in the face of lebid as if he meant to say to me what imports to know whether my son be delirious or maniacal  the learned effendi understood him and continued  it is the immortal darwini the nightingale of schirauz who in his negaristan there are many of these persian anthologies saadi of schirauz has composed two of these works admirable for their moral philosophy the gulistan that is a garden of roses and the bostan which means a garden of fruits they are composed in verse and prose interwoven with anecdotes moralities and political observations there are also the negaristan or gallery of pictures by jouini and the beharistan or mansion of the spring of these anthologies versions are desirable to the curious and perhaps might render the first steps into the study of the language more pleasant to the persian student  or gallery of pictures with many a tender period discourses of the erotic passion since now we have discovered the mental hallucination of mejnoun it follows oh ahmed that his disorder is irremediable while his sensations are those of despair but his malady is not incurable if his sensations shall be those of hope mejnoun must be united to leila  the venerable chief clasped his hands and raising them to heaven on his murmuring lips died an orison to the prophet  end of part the second part the third in the absence of her lord and since the flight of her son the mother of mejnoun was accustomed to watch in his tent her soul was attached to that abode for it found a solemn and sweet pleasure amidst a scene full of her passion even his empty sopha was not approached by her without trepidation his suspended robe her imagination would embody with his person and when she touched his instruments of music and they yielded sounds she once dwelt on with such fond pleasure a warm moisture filled her eyes and she sighed intensely at the local recollections around  she was one day watching at its entrance afar she descries a cloud of dust her heart bounded against her breast she calls to her attendants she strains her eye to discern some object she views nothing but a moving cloud gradually the cloud seems to open she distinguishes lances gleaming in the glancing sunbeams she discerns camels she inquires of all around does my lord return her fond impatience exceeded the faculty of vision it was impossible to know whether it were their own bedoweens or a caravan of travelers some whose eye only passed over the surface of a vast indistinct body to please their desolated mistress deemed it was their own party the troop keep directing their way to the tents in their valley at length a precursor is viewed and the breathless bedoween rushes into the tent exclaiming  kais returns and sunk at the feet of his mistress  he returns but to the mother of kais the return of her son was painful as his absence she views that cherished son led in without consciousness and hardly with sensation his drooping head rested on his bosom while his haggard looks assured her he was no more sensible to his existence even at his voice his beloved voice she shuddered as it hoarsely repeated at intervals the name of leila the old ahmed approached his desponding wife he kissed her in silence while his tears fell with his kisses on her cheek she looked on him in agony and turned to her son and raised her hands to heaven and sunk fainting into the arms of her lord  mejnoun is laid on a couch of indian silk placed on a carpet of persia his mother suffers no one to attend him her own hands scatter the rose water over his disfigured body disentangle his matted hair perfume and curl his wavy tresses vest him with a tunic of the goldcloth of cairo and fill his goblet with the wine of schirauz as she knew he was delighted by persian elegance the scene was persian his tent is hung with the tapestry which the needle painted suspended by cords of purple silk running through rings of silver and gold while musk ambergris and the wood of aloes breathe in a cloud from the censers as he was used to be delighted by beautiful plants she placed around his couch in vases some of the most curious and most fragrant shrubs she could obtain and on the ground on which his eyes were continually fixed she strewed fresh flowers and sweetscented vegetables that it might bear some slight resemblance to the earth itself in the spring season she fanned him with branches of odorous herbs and while the air refreshed him he would sometimes yield a longdrawn respiration  mejnoun at first smiled not nor seemed conscious of the devoted tenderness of his mother when a temporary pause of reason takes place he considers the existing scenery as a dream while his own lengthened dreams he considers as an existing scene he scarcely yet believes he has returned to his tent he touches his mother with curiosity rather than with affection and slowly paces at times around his tent with an inquiring eye that seems uneasy at an illusion again he relapses into a mild delirium  it is the philosophic friend the venerable effendi who effects what has baffled the anxiety of maternal inquietude seizing all the vacillations of his unsteady heart and confirming his dubious ideas he gradually restores him mejnoun one day made a silent motion to open his tent not without alarm the anxious mother understood him and trembled as she imagined it indicated his desire of again escaping from home cautiously she opened it a little  a little more exclaimed the recovering maniac in a tender tone a little more it is paradise opening and scattering its balmy airs how vivid the verdure how cheering the blue sky and he gazed intensely on the face of the country and often sighed  rejoice said the effendi to the anxious mother thy son will soon be restored the tones of his voice have returned to their natural pitch and the first desire of his heart is the aspect of nature trust me he who loves the view of nature will not forget his mother  one day mejnoun fell on the neck of the effendi and wept over the venerable man a deep respiration labored in his breast he pressed the hand of lebid and in that pressure told he was conscious of the present scene and halfremembered the past he first called for his mother he sunk at her feet his father embraced him and a fathers tears filled his eyes beloved son he exclaimed return not without an affectionate heart to thy merciless father thy mother loved thee and i too loved thee yet have we acted differently console me for the persecution thou have suffered teach me to pardon myself thy fathers heart was once a soldiers it is now timid as the heart of a frightened child look mildly on an old man who was once thy father despise not ahmed in his old age if love has caused thee all thy sufferings love may remunerate thee with all thy joys my son smile but on me and let me die in peace  mejnoun in kneeling to his father often by tender gestures interrupted the humiliating language of affection at length he said  my father it is not possible i am only restored to reason to know all my wretchedness leila can never be mine the pride of nobility has hardened the heart of the emir let me quit a world in which i have ceased to be useful trust me i am fitted for a hermitage i care not for the honor of my friends and am placable to the insult of an enemy what is a man alike incapable of friendship or of enmity  o thou desert thou unshadowy waste to me pleasant is the abode of thy unrelenting rocks there i view nothing of humanity but the farheard caravan that sometimes passes on like some low cloud hanging heavily over the earth yes my father i will live without leila but i must live in a desert  such was the resolve of mejnoun when recovered from his delirium but allured by the hope of possessing leila while every day confirmed the constancy of her heart the desert receded from his imagination as the world opened more prosperously at first his father attempted to amuse his mind by continued festivals by the versatility of pleasure and sought to dissipate his passion by procuring the most beautiful dancing women every day he renewed his promise to apply in person to the father of leila while he slowly prepared valuable gifts to win the obduracy of the emir hope for the intemperate mejnoun opens another fountain of his feelings from a delirious despair he breaks into a delirious joy he riots in futurity his days are vowed to the festivities of pleasure and his nights to the visions of imagination  he was now no more surnamed mejnoun but was called by his companions serguerdasi which in the persian idiom means a saunterer or literally one who does nothing but turn his head now on one side and now on another his eye was now intensely fixed on the pouting lip and the circling cup and his ear wandered in the shrill joy of the pipe and the tenderness of the lute but while his cheek glowed with animation and the blood beat more vitally round his heart at times his pulse was irregular and a fever breathed its unnatural heat in his veins at these moments he composed anacreontics like the following one a festive ode too fond too fond of odorous wine of womans wantonrolling eye of musics soulinvading sound some coldcomplexiond sage divine would cloud our pleasureechoing sky and close the laughing eye around we like his heaven our duteous earth with wine as muskd as green a glade shall image forth the visiond bliss lo echo wakes our bower with mirth while through yon roses veiling shade how murmurs light the sweetvoicd kiss as the wine gurgles in the glass with wavering hand and dancing brain tipsy  a monarch on my throne i bid my numbered subjects pass soberd  it is sheep that graze the plain and i a cameldrivers son when i drink freely then indeed i am lord of a royal castle and of a throne but when i awake from ebriety then certainly i am only master of sheep and of camels  richardsons arabic grammar  to day the clouds light daughter fair the vines bold son in marriage blends the son of the clouds espouses the daughter of the vine is a beautiful allusion to the mixing of water with wine and as richardson observes often employed by the arabians i have changed the sex for not only is wine more powerful than water but wine is likewise emblematic of the fire and warmth of man and water of the delicacy and yielding softness of woman it appears that the asiatics as well as the greeks and romans in their usual compotations diluted their wines with water and when they committed a cheerful debauch drank their more heavy wines with a very little water  see sir edward barrys curious essay on the wines of the ancients  to day a hundred lips are mine boy to my love this goblet bear if she her purple lip but lends the rim i will drink the kiss in wine a persian poet addresses his cupbearer thus  fix a kiss on the brim of the cup and the wine will then be sweet as if mixed with honey and in mr notts version of hafez the persian anacreon we have  while the fair ones rubyd lip flavours every cup we sip this playful idea is used by the greek poets it is certain that the greeks have largely borrowed from the warm imaginations of the orientalists anacreon alludes to a peculiar cosmetic found among the persians see notes on caliph vathek p      my learned friend mr richard hole has lately published an ingenious essay to trace the fables of homer among the arabian nights langhorne has justly observed that the genius of every species of poetry originates in the east and was transplanted by the muses of greece in the philological inquiries of the learned harris he says  such resemblances prove a probable connection between the manners of the arabians and those of the ancient greeks p        ye girls with flowing steps arrange the enamouring labyrinth of dance and wind and kiss and fly and turn and lose me in each gliding change ah while your feathery feet advance aim at my heart the eyes that burn major ouseley describes the persians as great voluptuaries who delight in their feasts to unite the pleasures of wine with the charms of music and to heighten the luxurious enjoyments of the banquet by the presence of some beloved or beautiful object  we are fond of wine says a persian poet wanton dissolute and with rolling eyes but who is there in this city who has not the same vices we are immersed in pleasure and delight and are constantly listening to the melody of the lute and the cymbal  those who describe persian feasts relate that musicians both vocal and instrumental attended handsome pages carried round wine and singing and dancing women with venal charms completed the persian banquet    at length mejnoun murmurs at the protracted happiness and suspects the stillrepeated promise they observed a new change in this variable and toosensitive being suddenly he quits his gay society his face is suffused with faint blushes and his voice faulters his eyes are again cast to the earth his bosom palpitates he refuses his meals and in a few weeks a wan countenance betrays his nightly fevers his mother alarmed at the menaced change of his passions prompts her venerable lord to the humiliation of personal entreaty and now with a reluctance concealed in his own breast the old hero hastens to the tents of the greenturbaned emir  he enters and addresses him  descendant of fatima deign to unite thy enchanting daughter with my unhappy son already have thou heard of the long delirium of the wanderer ah who ever loved like mejnoun behold him restored to glory pleasure lights his splendid cheek his immortal voice renews the verses arabia remembers and all our youth call for the union of thy rose with my nightingale thou know the prophet has made me a fortunate man the trees i have planted live the fountains i have opened were never dry to leila i will give a hundred virgins they are the roses of our valley a thousand armed bedoweens each mounted on a white courser and five hundred camels and two thousand shepherds these shall surround her tent my soul is now meditating to depart and in the flying hour of fate little to me it imports whether i die on a throne or perish in the dust but parental affection lives beyond the grave and thou who art a father wilt not be insensible to the prayer of a father  such was the humble solicitation of the magnificent veteran but the emir whose cheek was scorched and whose blood was acrid with envy as he listened to the opulence of ahmed and whose obdurate heart was puffed up by the pomp of birth received him with a fierce disdain tauntingly reproached the spiritless father with the delirium of his son and with the bitterest mockery an arabian gives he added  imbecile bedoween see thou not that the wrong side of thy turban is out bedoween honor is still more delicate than ours and requires even a greater number of victims to be sacrificed to it if one schiek says to another with a serious air thy bonnet is dirty or the wrong side of thy turban is out nothing but blood can wash away the reproach  niebuhr vol ii p       a deep groan broke from the old ahmed twice he stroked his beard and half unsheathed his scymitar but the thought of still further distressing his son by the death of leilas father thwarted his just vengeance he quietly sheathed his scymitar exclaiming  what sort of a man art thou that can be ignorant of love thou oh prophet have witnessed all in this accursed tent i and my son alike have received eternal ignominy the passion of glory has died away in the bosom of my son o love thou jealous passion that wilt not suffer another to abide with thee  he returned home humiliated but studious to conceal his feelings from his son this unhappy father entered his tent with a feeble smile on his aged countenance but the perspicacity of mejnoun perceived the reception he had suffered and it pierced his soul when he reflected that the intemperance of his passion had given dishonor to a venerable heroism and for ever disturbed the slumbers of an old fathers eyes his soul pined he for ever abandoned the gaieties of his convivial day and amid the loneliest spots composed the most touching gazels gazels are sonnets i do not know whether they derive this name from the animal so called and celebrated for the tenderness of its eyes and the gentleness and beauty of its form  he now talked of returning to the desert  for the last act of piety and despair his father proposed a pilgrimage to mecca it was a long journey for one of his age but he would not perform the awful function by proxy and in the holy house of the patriarch abraham he halfhoped to listen to the celestial whisperings of piteous seraphs or at the tomb of the prophet to behold some miracle operating on the intellect of his son  i go said the aged ahmed like the good patriarch with his son isaac may i be the sacrifice to propitiate heaven that has deserted us  they arrive at the sanctuary they repeat the numerous prayers and perform the numerous ablutions and present the numerous offerings they kiss the black goldembroidered silk on the top of the sacred caaba reverently they touch the golden gutters and drink of the gelid water of the well zemzem which in the arid soil suddenly opened for hagar when in search of water for ismael they pace with the enthusiasm of piety along the numerous arcades formed by those vast columns which suspend a thousand silver lamps for ever illumined dimming the eye through the dread stilness with a religious light they spread their carpets and tremblingly prostrate themselves before the black stone which the angel gabriel hewed from the rocks of the cauther whose stream rolls in heaven over beryl beds and whose shores are gold  one day mejnoun entered the temple alone he approached the black stone and hears from its opposite side the voice of his father fervently supplicating heaven and offering his vows that his son might forget leila  mejnoun heard and the sullenness of anger with the ferocity of despair glared in his distracted eyes with a horrid impatience he strikes his temples with his clenched hands while his uncertain feet scarcely enable him to fly he crawls to a remote aisle and flings himself on the marble floor  and have we come here he cries to form vows those are not mine how hateful is the voice of fathers no leila they shall not seduce me we will despair but we will laugh at fathers thou suffer may thou not suffer like me here in this holy temple here where i seem to feel the divinity about me here i swear we are united i was thine i am doubly thine  can sympathy at this moment tell thee of this our sad nuptial it is the marriage of despair and heaven is here at once our priest our witness and our perseeutor  at the close of the day he steals from the temple and escapes from mecca he gains the desert neighboring the tents of leila a wanderer in the same paths and in the same delirium more exanimate than formerly he cannot climb the precipitous rocks but crawls and gasps along the hot briny sands sometimes he lies stretched and fancies he shall never again rise his torn vestments he fastens by thorns his casual food he picks from the earth feeding often on a solitary lizard and grasping the fainting adder curses and rejects it  but nature too friendly to despairing men ceases the violence of sufferance when its operations tend to annihilation mejnoun becomes more mild for he composes verses his tender soul attaches itself to whatever surrounds it and to all that has life the solitary sighs his bewildered spirit addressed itself to a raven in verses which the lovers of this day still repeat which still give beautiful tears to the beautiful faces of the seraglio and convey an idea of passion even to the imperial heart of the sophi one day he approached a tree to enjoy its shade it saluted him by lowly bending its inoffensive branches he started he touched the foliage and every leaf trembled with animation at this silent hospitality this visible sympathy this endearment of sensibility the melancholy soul of mejnoun was touched and he wept beneath that tree but as he perceived that while he continued under it the branches drooped more and more he rose from the grateful shade lest in the hospitality it offered it should entirely consume its generous virtues  ah others may come as wretched as myself cried mejnoun and i would not deprive them of the consolation of a sensitive tree there are in arabia several species of the mimosa either trees or shrubs the tree mimosa is so much endeared to the arabians that the injuring or cutting it down is strictly prohibited  niebuhr vol ii p       urged by the poignancy of hunger he sought one day for food and his hand only grasped the tawny and withered herb he discovered a hunter with a fawn he pursues the hunter who startled by the manspectre flies but the feet of mejnoun were winged by despair and the steps of the timid hunter relaxed as they flew he crouches and supplicates for life but mejnoun kneeled to the kneeling man  i entreat thee man replied mejnoun to give me thy fawn for i perish the hunter recovering from his terrors at the mild imbecility of the mejnoun claimed for the purchase the diamond on his finger mejnoun presented it to him  to the inhabitant of a desert said he a fawn is well purchased by a diamond take it and be proud let the vanity glitter among the vain if thou reachest leila the daughter of the emir amri ask her who gave thee this ring  art thou kais inquired the hunter  i was kais replied mejnoun in a solemn tone the awed hunter prostrated himself  heaven said he has touched thy lips with celestial fire and thy brain glows with the delirium of holiness thy ring is a sainted relic in adversity i will kiss it all that a mejnoun wears they say is holy my way is remote can thou tell me inhabitant of the desert the hour of the day  i do not count my hours replied mejnoun often indeed i look up to the heavens to see where the sun is but what signifies to me in what part of heaven he shines since pleasure flies me at whatever point he touches the hunter entreated the blessing of the amorous maniac who pensively departed with slow steps looking on and leading the fawn  he had obtained the fawn to satiate the violence of appetite but his lifted hand having rudely touched its budding horns their exquisite sensibility prompted the beautiful animal to yield a tender insantine cry which spoke to the heart of the melancholy man its slender tongue licked his raised hand and it fixed its full eyes on its persecutor the view of the fawn revived the memory of his constant gazel he sat down and wept over it and thus with a romantic sensibility addressed it  beauty of solitude thou whose mild aspect and delicate elegance can give even to a desert the sensation of peace thy innocent blood passion never yet inflamed shall it distain my hand my hand which only knows to caress thee i will court thee by affectionate familiarities when thou shall know that i love thee thou shall lead me if thou will for peace is in thy inoffensive steps live and console my hermitpath mine shall be the delightful employment to guard thy branchy horns from the entangling thicket to gaze on thee till thou understandest me to repeat the name of leila till thou shall remember it sweet fawn what shade is most grateful to thy brilliant eyes where loves thy slender elegance to repose the tall pine tree from whence thou strippest the bark or the wild chestnut on the mountain to sport with its provoking and polished shell or the mannatree in summer mornings dropping its yellow liquid or the almond with silvery or rosaceous blossoms when its mature fruit with gentle violence opens its own shield or the whiteleaved poppies whose narcotic diffuses in the air if not culled ere the sun strikes the flowers and taints the livid face of the gatherer trembling with the potent opiates he breathes trust me if thou love the sweet poppies thou shall have them will thou lay thy soft length along in the cotton field beware dear fawn of the fatal gulbad samour whose flowers poison the wind and let me folicitously deter thy innocence from the kerzehre that hypocrite of the forest whose boughs are covered with roses but whose deleterious dews while they sparkle on blasts the earth that receives them i consulted chardin for an account of the trees and flowers of persia vol ii p  0  to  i cannot omit noticing a beautiful illumination in the splendid persian manuscript of mr douce mejonoun is represented seated nearly naked and feeding a spotted fawn the whole form of the maniac is squalid meagre and famine is in every limb the antelope is highly finished with all those minute and exquisite touches which distinguish the brilliant pencil of the persian painter the artists of that country excel in the human physiognomy and the face of the mejnoun is here pourtrayed with peculiar felicity it is famished and melancholy yet the sympathising smile while it feeds the gazel is thrown over part of the features and may be compared to a little sunshine illumining a dark cloud     thus conversed the fanciful mejnoun with his fawn society not wanting in his solitude it renewed his gentlest emotions and a fawn could tame the desperate man to refresh his fawn he often eluded the brazen sky and the thirsty sands and stole to the green borders of persia stretching himself on the flowers that richly clothe that vernal soil while the fawn gamboled among the beds of tulips anemones and jonquils sir john chardin thus describes the borders of persia the mazanderan the most western parts of this country is one parterre from the month of september to the close of april the face of the country is covered with flowers on the northern borders of arabia the country produces of itself tulips anemones etc and about ispahan jonquils grow spontaneosly and there are flowers through the winter   in this second flight to the desert his retreat had been undiscovered till he met the hunter who hastening to leila for the promise given to a mejnoun he considered as a point of religion acquainted her with his abode the disconsolate maiden could not resist the desire of visiting her lover and her maniac and with a confidential slave contrived to escape for a short time on horses procured in haste  arrived in the desert they soon became faint in the hot blasts as they passed by murky and projecting rocks piled in awful masses the skies were frequently hid from their eyes till the landscape suddenly opened on all sides its immense horizon in the evershifting sands their track was frequently lost and then they were only guided by a number of pillars erected across the plain in sight of each other this curious circumstance is noticed by pocock in his travels through egypt  the sand reverberated the beams of the sun no breeze refreshed no shade sheltered while in the vast glare of light that dazzled their aching eyes they held a fan of painted feathers before their faces but their horses slowly proceeded as the briny sand scorched their hoofs it is for this reason that camels are preferred to horses whose tender feet are incapable of traveling in the hot sands  at length they discovered an arch hewed in a rock from whose cleft jutted out a young laurel tree here they sat some time till the slave suddenly exclaimed behold and pointing to one side of the rock which had been polished into smoothness leila viewed her portrait he lives here she cried perhaps not replied the slave perhaps thy portrait is engraven on every rock  three hours had elapsed and mejnoun appeared not the slave wailed often repeating aloud unhappy leila a fawn appeared as she pronounced the name they wondered as they heard a shrill hoarse voice vociferating leila leila the fawn disappeared the person who had called was in the narrow paths among the precipices and was heard to say what induced thee my beloved to quit me so suddenly this evening  it is mejnoun exclaimed the agitated leila support me i pray thee i am sick at heart she sunk into the arms of the slave the wan form of mejnoun approached he perceives two females he recognizes leila he loses his voice a quick suffusion flushed and died away on his pallid countenance a faint light glistened in his eyes he bends on tottering knees he would embrace leila but falls before her in extreme debility  he creeps to her tremulously he grasps her knees he rises he presses her in his arms he rests his eyes on her face till the recovering beauty returns his glances inarticulate sounds murmur on their lips and they touch and tremble  vision of the earth exclaimed the delirious mejnoun can thou deceive me with substantial forms i live on deliriously my life is but a protracted dream breathing form have thou not a voice tell me quickly tell me art thou indeed leila  i am thy leila oh mejnoun thus to meet thee i steal from my fathers tents to tell thee how i love thee to win thee from thy solitude and to hear those songs thou have composed on myself resounding through arabia ah beneath my hand how thy heart palpitates sweet love look not so wildly on me thou art so woebegone o thou who art called mejnoun it is for me that sad that sweet that sainted name is thine she broke into a full gush of tears  she ceased yet mejnoun seemed still listening to her voice  it is surely the voice of leila he said in a solemn tone we meet not as heretofore but never sounded thy accents sweeter than in this desert formerly we trod on a silent carpet and sat in a pleasant kiosque while the jessamines and roses prodigally wasted their aromatic souls in the air we breathed all then my love wasted about us and above all leila we wasted our hours o had we then forgotten we had fathers we might have lived in this desert and we should have lived happy no i will not think of happiness it will make me mad for me then have thou trodden on the scorching sands and felt the brazen skies of a desert romantic maid i thank thee likest thou this perilous assignation be cautious girl there is temerity in thy attempt i have seen the eye of the wild lion glare as he passed on yet fear not here are no fathers ah if thou would become the tenant of this desert then would the briers be sweet as the wild eglantine and the hot sands smooth as the silken carpet  the bewildered air and the unsteady thoughts of mejnoun alarmed leila and she turned silently to the slave they had brought some provisions in a pannier  will my lord cried the slave repose and taste our refreshments anxiety and fatigue have been more sultry to us than the desert nor has my mistress opened but one pomegranate since sunrise  dear mejnoun said leila with her fascinating smile our hour is short share in these meats and these fruits restore thyself my love  his hand was folded in her own and she gave it the tenderest pressure that longlost sensation returning to his soul his sympathetic nerves repeated emotions that memory had almost forgotten he sighed tears started in his eyes he kissed her hand he smiled and said  leila behold me what i once was behold thy kais  they sat down the slave spread the various refection consisting of pomegranates and watermelons and pistachio nuts and variouscoloured grapes with plates of rice and the flesh of goats she had also brought the cooling tamarinds to express in their beverage but the bardaks of water she had broken in her haste and she loudly lamented the want of a sherbet  thou art the first luxurious girl cried mejnoun who ever mourned for a sherbet in a desert thou art but young in misery  eagerly grasping a handful of fresh flowers which she had also brought and sighing as the odours reached him he said  the scent of flowers from the hand of one we love leila how delicious to the hermit in a desert who has almost forgotten how flowers smell when they are given to us by a friend  leila dropped a tear and mejnoun caught the living pearl on a rose and kissed it off the leaf  in their rambling conversation they made more questions than they could form answers and the last hour of this romantic visit was to close the moon shone in its mid path and the crystal light warned the slave to commence their shadowy journey the lovers reminded of the time were alike unwilling to separate they sat retired and every time the slave came to them she was remanded back every time she saw the longlanguishing looks their eyes mingled but in the eyes of leila the tears suffused their brilliancy and they shone like moonlight in the water at length she cried  my mistress will perish in the blaze of the sun consider my lord we came but on horses and i am sure they will die in the sandy waste and drop us in the desert my lord my lord we maidens cannot live like hermits  roused by the clamours of the slave mejnoun sustained leila he looked on the moon and saw it declining in its blue path  how shall i live after this he cried yet let us haste i will conduct thee to the borders of the desert perfection of beauty peri of my soul when we again meet i shall open for thee the silver gate of paradise  they proceeded slowly on their journey till the slave again exclaimed  ah look my lord she pointed to the moon it was almost extinguished and glided away on the verge of the sky mejnoun reluctantly hurried on and now they reached the borders of the desert and stopped to take a last farewell the dawn already peered above the horizon with its argent whiteness and the sun now threw an amberstreak and was on the point of coloring the heaven with its vermilion part of the mountains before them had the purple hue of the halfillumined nightshadows they gaze on the beamless sun they kneel before the soul of the universe and clasping their hands vow an eternal passion leila supplicates for his return to his fathers tents  no replied mejnoun i will not live where our fathers live  voiceless they embrace slowly they part quickly they return now afar they wave their hands and mejnoun gazed on leila till her figure melted in the air and seemed a speck to his eye  alone after this interview for the first time he perceived the horrors of the desert habit had softened the aspect of the surrounding terrors despair had even endcared them but the fatal presence of the object in which all his passions centered again convulsed the volcano of his heart at times he thought to pursue her to detain her to plunge into one abyss and to find together an eternal rest his frame betrays the rapid volitions of his heart flashes of heat are succeeded by chilly fits thoughts offuscate thoughts he returns to the spot whence leila departed he runs along the sands his voice howls and shrieks he tears up the trees by their roots and flings them in the air he pursues the wild animals and satiates the anger of his soul in their murders he rejoices to make the desert more desert he tears away the young laurel that jutted from his grottoed rock once he had taught it to grow there with a little pride it remembered him of glory at length he swoons it was only on the succeeding night that the miserable maniac awoke from his delirium then faint he tranquilly gazed on the tranquil moon and caressed his fawn that laid its head on his knees  surely he cried it was but in a dream that i have seen leila and thus he addressed the sawn  sleep by the light of the moon fair fawn the moonbeams will not hurt thy dark brilliant eyes shall i rhyme thee to sleep last night i slept and i dreamed  dear animal thou too dreamest of the green valley thou have left of the flowers thou have smelt ah happiness is not banished from the cell of the hermit if he has but a dream of love  he now addressed an ode to the moon which related the lovers dream crystal world thy shadows pour land where fancy builds her bower in thy silvercircle deep lies the treasury of sleep many a glittering dream of air many a picturing phantom there shades of soft ideas bless images of happiness last night in sleep my love did speak i pressed her hand i kissed her cheek her forehead was with softness hung soft as the timid moon when young two founts of silvery light unfold with eye balls dropping liquid gold her brows nor part nor join their jet in an anonymous version of anacreons ode in which he directs the painter how to delineate the portrait of his mistress this idea is finely given then her eyebrows trace with art mingle not nor wholly part nor is the idea quite lost in longepierres languid translation which i give for the sake of the curious note peignant de ses sourcils les arcs et la noirceur prens guard egalement que ton pinceau menteur ne les confonde ou les separe this was considered as the principal beauty of the eyebrows with the ancients they studied to approach them artfully to each other neither quite joined and scarcely separated theocritus calls a maid  the virgin with mingled eyebrows petronius describing a beauty says  her brows were spread on one side to the extremity of her cheeks and on the other came almost in contact confusing themselves and uniting above her nose  ovid has  art supercilii confinia nuda repletis de art amandi lib iii the beauties of the ancients employed a black sparkling tincture for their eyebrows and their lids and the same practice is in use with all the orientals  her teeth like pearls in coral set her bosom gave its odorous swell each breathing wave now rose now fell and often the flying blushes deck with vermil light her marble neck a beautiful neck is frequently called by the greeks a marble neck those only who are ignorant of the magic of sculpture conceive it a hard and cold image the beauty of the neck consists in its exquisite white and smooth polish like that of parian marble  ah union strange of chaste desire mixed in her cheek were snow and fire my lips a million kisses pour her silvershining body over sadi employs the compound epithet of silverbodied another persian poet has  necks fair as silver    lengthening her crisped locks embraced the beauty laughing round her waist these snare the soul these wake the sigh i gazed till madness fired the eye to the long note on hair in the poem on the land of cashmere the following ought to have been joined  crisped hair though as mr price observes a picturesque object yet silken hair is also a favorite one anacreon in the language of the ode just quoted tells the painter  paint her hair of lovely brown softer than the cygnets down then if paint so fine be found sketch the odours breathing round next one beauteous cheek display where her glossy ringlets play over her ivory brow descending light and shade so sweetly blending   the ancients never give a description of beauty without dwelling long on the magic of a womans hair a volume on this subject might perhaps be collected by one familiar with their compositions apuleius enthusiastically says that if venus herself were bald although circled by the graces and the loves she would not please not even her swarthy vulcan  petronius in his portrait of circe describes her tresses naturally curling and falling negligently over her shoulders entirely covering them  apuleius more exact and with still more delicacy  her trailing locks thick and long and insensibly curling were dispersed about her divine neck softly undulating with carelessness  again curling into waves again  her thick tresses softly falling from her head were arranged about her neck and insensibly resting on the borders of her vest above her bosom then wound their extremities into large curls while some were drawn up and hung in a fine knot on the crown of her head ovid notices those who platted their braided hair like spiral shells  petronius to give an idea of a perfect beauty says that her forehead was small and showed the roots of her hair raised upwards and lucian makes thais say of a rival courtezan how can that stupid soldier unless he is blind praise her person does he not see that she has very few hairs which with great art she draws up on her large forehead    the softclosd lips i viewed awhile just opened with the tenderest smile i heard her voice but too intent the dream dissolved as still i leant  yet till the daybreak lit the sky that not one word might ever die repeated over and over each word till something like her voice was heard thou friend to love romantic night now hang a painted dream like this i grasp a shadow of delight a painted dream is all my bliss the following sonnet or gazel from the divan of jami is given by major ouseley in his oriental collections p     and from which i derived the idea of this poem last night my eyes were closed in sleep but my happiness awake the whole night the livelong night the image of my beloved was the companion of my soul heavens how did the sugared words fall from her sweeter lips alas all that she said to me in that dream has escaped from my memory although it was my care till break of day to repeat over and over her sweet words the day unless illuminated by her beauty is to my eyes of nocturnal darkness happy day that first i gazed upon that lovely face may the eyes of jami long be blessed with pleasing visions since they presented to his view last night that object on whose account he passed his waking life in expectation   the curious reader will find that the ode already quoted of anacreon and other parts of the teian bard bear a great affinity with oriental and persian poetry this is no place to conjecture that anacreon first produced entire by henry stephens was possibly borrowed from the persians      every day his verses became more wild but certainly not less poetical the rock he haunted was well known to the hunters and the gentleness of the mejnoun had prompted them to repay the sweetness of his romantic songs by leaving provisions in his rocky vault they also frequently placed there the silk paper and the splendid ink of persia with egyptian reeds one piously came to supplicate his blessing another with purer taste to entreat for copies of his verses and each in return promised to be the messenger of his love and secretly to convey to his mistress the envoi he deigned to confide to them he suffered their presence with patient benevolence and sometimes soothed his agitated mind with the selfsupported love of fame and imaged in his reveries the sympathies and the applauses posterity has given to him  end of part the third part the fourth noufel the iman of sana was equally renowned for a passion for poetry and for hunting wandering one day near the rock of mejnoun this prince listened to his voice he was touched by its melodious melancholy and while the poetry indicated the unsteady heart of the poet the united delirium of his art his love and his exile was more interesting than the regular and courtly measures that fatigued his ear in his palace  noufel silently enters into the twilight gloom of the vaulted rock in its subdued light he views mejnoun in a recumbent posture the affectionate fawn was stretched before him and a manuscript was placed on its softbreathing body mejnoun was in the act of composition a warm radiance sparkled at times in his hollowed eyes that often fixed on an opposite portrait of leila his extended hand held a reed he repeated verses till they found cadence he gave utterance to ideas and to images that perplexed by their variety his gestures accompanied the passions he described  such were the deliria of reverie often he closed his periods with the tenderest sigh and with the soft part of the reed often relieved his eye from the tear that clouded  the sensibility of the prince never slumbered he feared to rush too abruptly in the presence of a man whose tremulous nerves suffered such a fine irritability he stole away gliding on tiptoe from the vault reaching its entrance he inquired of his hunters if they knew who was the mejnoun who haunted this spot  it is the lover of leila  and is the finest poet of arabia left to perish in solitude cried noufel men of genius it is thus ye are admired and never consoled  he bid a hunter blow his horn but to blow it with a sound so mellow that it should fall like a remote harmony on the ear of mejnoun he blew and the tones played lightly among the circling echoes mejnoun appeared noufel approached him and taking his hand smiling said  enchanting poet eternal lover behold noufel me perhaps thou know not for i am but a prince but thou art known to me for thou art a poet my subjects cherish me but of thee the world is enamoured will thou deign to accept my protection leila shall be thine i swear by alborak on which the prophet rode to heaven is the emir avaricious i will offer him treasures ambitious i will give thee dignities insensible to kindness my troops have taught despots to feel yes thou shall have leila and all that i implore of thee is to embellish my court with thy glory delight us with the graces of thy splendid verse instruct us by the wisdom of thy solemn precept  mejnoun searched with an inquiring eye the face of the iman his physiognomy had every waving tender line of sensibility and as their eyes met they understood each other the hope of possessing leila exhilarated his astonished soul and he replied  thy offer is pure who but the gentlest of men would court a hermit thy amiable soul opens itself to love and poetry thou give me hope it is a sweet aliment to a wounded spirit yet hope was once my parasite and flattered and revelled and ruined yet hope is still dear it is so strange to my feelings it is a sensation so long forgotten that scarcely my feeble heart knows how to receive it  the enthusiast now at the court of noufel received from the sensitive prince new honors every day he ordered that a medalla or large parasol should be ever carried before him the distinction of independent nobility he prepares an embassy for the emir and composes the letter himself in which he invited his consent by the munificence of his offers and menaced his refusal by the terror of his arms  the haughty emir tore the letter before the face of the ambassador violently stamped on the fragments and sarcastically congratulated him on the wisdom of his prince who proposed creating a distracted lover his chief minister the emir summons his tribe nousel collects his bands at length they meet and pausing ere they combat watch the motions of each other  mejnoun two days preceding the battle dispatched a trusty page to the camp of the emir he has orders to enter secretly the tent of leila and to prevail on her to fly with him that a battle might be spared the page pursues his way with the devoted zeal of a messenger of love he travels by moonlight through unbeaten paths when he meets a stream he swims across it a precipice he leaps over it a hill he runs up it and along the smooth valley he trips so lightly that at morning his sandals are scarcely wet and faintly silvered over by the nightdews he approaches the camp of the enemy and observed the armed arabs sleeping in the moonlight he dexterously shuns the sentinels by creeping under hedges and often hiding his little body among the tall grass and fringed fern he reaches the tent of leila gliding in he views at the farend the beauty by a solitary lamp and the holy koran lying before her on which sometimes she directed her unquiet eyes the little page is at a loss how to discover himself he folds his hands on his breast and kneels leila fancies in the delirium of piety that the beautiful boy is some winged genii of whom she had read in the persian tales she recovers her understanding in listening to the message the little page tells her how he had swam across streams leaped over precipices run up hills and crept unseen in the tall grass  i cannot do all this said leila it is only a little boy like thyself who can be so secret a traveller surely thy beloved lord is still a mejnoun  at length after a week had elapsed in extreme weariness and they had watched incessantly the motions of each other the combat commenced the army of noufel amounted to a thousand horsemen that of the emir was inferior and they joined with equal valor but unequal force they struck sabres against sabres couched their long lances and pointed them at without touching each others breasts they wheeled about each other with equal celerity they uttered loud and shrill vociferations stood with menacing gestures and tried each others sagacity by artful feints sometimes they mingled with an apparent rage now pursuing and now flying as the vigor of their arm prevailed clouds of dust were rolled above and around they combated in this manner for twelve hours till the troops of the emir left on the field of battle seven of their companions who lay motionless bruised by the fall from their horses the route then became general a panic was caught by the emirs soldiery and the army of nousel proved victorious by outwearying their enemies in this manner are the bloodless combats of the arabs which appear similar to those of the ancient condottieri of italy where a whole day was fought and a single soldier wounded often decided the fortune of the day niebuhr observes that an army of a thousand arabs will take to flight and think themselves routed if they lose but seven or eight of their number pages in his travels exhibits a very entertaining narrative of such an engagement after a running fight the whole day on one side none were killed or wounded while these boasted of a triumph for having killed no more than one man and some camels   the tent of the emir was surrounded and mejnoun yielding the honor of first entering it to his patron the prince took prisoner the emir and his daughter touched by the beauty of the virgin he gazes in silent admiration and thinks that even mejnoun had not sufficiently inspired his imagination with such a model of beauty the haughty father stood beside her nor relinquished the hand of his daughter till the prince in gently separating them claimed the right of conquest fear modesty and grief were expressed in the variable face of leila in tears in blushes and in tremors at the view of so much beauty more beautiful in its disorder the feeling soul of noufel inspired his first action with magnanimity  lovely maiden he cried fear not a conqueror who conquers but to restore thee to freedom to love and to mejnoun for thee obdurate emir in thy misfortune we forget thy pride return to thy tents  the friends of the emir kneeled to noufel the imperious emir himself was no more proud his hereditary spirit melted away in tenderness as his humid eyes rested on his daughter they embraced and wept and as he quitted her arms with a paternal sigh leila looked on mejnoun with anger and with grief her lover felt the silent indignation nor ventured to approach her the victor stood halfmourning his victory  the character of noufel was that of a quick susceptibility and the impulsion of his feelings was instantaneous but he was vain and volatile and ever touching the extreme of passion his heroism was but a temporary ebullition and that susceptibility which produced his virtues at times taking an opposite direction hurried him into impetuous crimes crimes which he could at once abhor and cherish in a word his heart was more ardent than intrepid his natural feelings were pure but they were at variance with the acquired habits of a court and he was rather a lover of virtue than virtuous  the emotions with which leila affected him were too powerful for a soul whose extreme softness is only the more dangerous when it tends to a gradual corruption at first he faintly wrestled with his desires but as the mind of leila calmed every day she became less resistible and he gazed while his whole frame trembled at the novel graces every day shot forth to his eye at the harmony of her features the bloom of her complexion and the enchantment diffused over her whole person the tender friendship she felt for the patron of her lover but the more provoked his ardour his soul was inflamed by her graceful smile and dissolved by her intendering tones and while he listened absorbed in the melody of her tongue if he looked up to her eyes he forgot her voice in their brilliancy unhappy noufel he felt himself at length so much attached to her that he now considered that her lover intruded on his claims and at the affectionate caresses of mejnoun he writhed in the agony of jealousy how often suddenly he quitted them sickening at their happiness while they with grateful eyes thanked him for that hour of delicious solitude which is so necessary for the existence of lovers  what cried the miserable prince shall i be the slave of mejnoun shall i yield the only happiness i have ever found to the solitary hand of a distracted man yes friendship justice and hospitality tell me this and what are ye all ye softheated virtues before the energy of power shall noufel be the most wretched in his court shall he make madmen happy by rendering himself most unhappy if this be virtue it is also folly a word annihilates mejnoun a word for ever unites me to leila what they will call me an impious bread and salt traitor a bread and salt traitor he who betrays his host or patron is one of the most opprobrious epithets by which one asiatic can express his detestation of another richardsons dissertation  in despotic countries indeed what so dangerous as the violation of private confidence  i shall violate the rights of hospitality the holy rights an arabian reveres ah what are rights to me  a lover and a prince noufel was not insensible to his own unworthiness and the pang of guilt was redoubled as he felt the insamy of guilt sometimes he resolves to have mejnoun assassinated but the diminution of his fame restrained him and he watches with perpetual solicitude if he could discover some action in mejnoun that might prove the disorder of his mind and the necessity of confinement but the intellect of mejnoun was never injured but when he was torn away from leila at length mejnoun complained in gentleness to noufel of his protracted happiness  noufel fixes on the day of his marriage he announces to the court that mejnoun on that day becomes his chief minister and to give publicity to his honors he commands a nightly illumination in the city of sana to precede the splendid banquet which is to solemnise the happiness of mejnoun and leila  the public festivities commenced mejnoun composed his epithalamiums and these were soon retained by the people who quitted all their occupations and for a whole week only studied to get by heart his verses at the corners of the streets were little knots of jugglers tumblers dancers and musicians while before the shops were placed on tables spread with aromatic flowers pyramids of refreshments with large jars of sorbet and pomegranate wine the various crafts were the whole day wandering in processions carrying before them streamers dazzling the eye with a thousand colors and exhibiting the implements of their professions in massy gold while attended by their musicians with kettledrums fifes and clarions they stopped under the balcony of mejnoun and leila and sang hymeneal verses tossing handfuls of flowers in the air at night the illumination was general and the darkest nook of the city seemed to be lighted up by a midnight sun every minareh was wreathed with variegated lights in the vast concaves of their domes shone a thousand lamps of colored glass and cords were thrown across from minareh to minareh on which the lamps were arranged into letters forming verses of the koran and on that night so general was the fanciful illumination that every house having chosen a different verse much of the sacred volume might have been read throughout the city in characters of flame the nightly illuminations of every minareh in the city produce a very singular and splendid effect within each of these the vast concaves of the domes are lighted up by some hundred lamps of colored glass the lamps are fantastically disposed in letters and figures i was not more agreeably surprised by any thing i saw in constantinople than the whole appearance of the first night in rammezan  dallaways constantinople p     in the persian tales mention is made of an illumination which was formed of these letters and were really verses from the koran and perhaps what might appear as fantastic figures to mr dallaway were in reality such verses     the succeeding day the banquet is prepared leila comes forth in her bridal vestments and ere the solemn rite is performed they partake of the splendid refection the artificial noufel has entrusted to his confidential page the infusion of a subtle poison in the wine of mejnoun noufel drinks to the health of the lovers while the page presents a foaming goblet to mejnoun noufel keeps his eye on him who thinks himself a bridegroom and in transport he beholds mejnoun empty without taking the goblet from his lips to conceal the secret pleasure of his heart his tongue is voluble his eye at times seems convulsed with rapture an agony of delight writhes his features the courtiers around the wretched mimics of their prince catch the gay extravagance of their master the pavilion sounds with one undistinguished clash of voices it was a delight that had terror in it the prince laughs till his voice shrieks he moves on his sopha till every limb trembles each courtier imitates the contortions of his rapture what he speaks is no more heard in the clamor of their joys at length they behold him fall from his sopha lifeless on the ground all is the silence of terror  mejnoun flies to his friend and his prince he holds him in his arms the face of noufel is blanched and livid his heavy lids are closed in death and his feeble accents fleeting on his quivering lips painfully tell  mejnoun yield me no pity the poisoned cup meant for thee has reached my own lips i loved leila and my love was terrible impious i prepared poison for my guest yes thy prince was thy traitor he sunk into his arms and expired in the slow agonies of a convulsion  an event so unexpected and terrific interrupted the nuptials the iman who on that very day succeeded noufel had none of the sensibility of that miserable victim of passion he had no attachment to poetry and to love but a great sagacity in politics and lamenting that a war should ever have been occasioned for a possession so little valuable as that of a woman sent leila back to the emir with an assurance of his veneration for one who wore a green turban  unhappy lovers what now but a hopeless futurity opens to your existence thinking of all ye were to be how bitter the meditation of what ye are while the remembrance of perjured and of perished friendship wounds beyond the grave of the traitor  my soul cried mejnoun yesterday rejoiced in possession and to day is desolated in ruin my happiness will not last out a solitary sun fortune effaces to day what yesterday she had written on her whitest page  leila returned to the tents of her father and mejnoun relapsed into his former delirious feeling but with a more deadly hatred of man and without a friend he regards himself as a naked sword without a sheath far removed from friends poor and solitary like a naked sword without a sheath  richardsons arabic grammar    again he flies into the desert and no one can discover his retreat  it was some time after the return of his daughter that the emir received a proposal of marriage from another emir for his son ebnselan the passion of leila was indeed universally known but since this last fatal event and the death of mejnoun as it was reported it was imagined that the beautiful virgin would not resist the passion of a youth who came recommended by the graces of his person and the splendour of his train such was the judgment of the two aged emirs while the fervors of the gentle ebnselan whose passion had been inspired by the verses of his rival prompted the hope of still winning the affections of one so capable of affection  but when leila was acquainted with the resolves of her father she shrieked she tore the rich calpuc from her hair and beating her bosom accused her parents of cruelty and heaven of injustice by gentle insinuations and by mild reproaches they essayed all the avenues of her susceptible heart she was assured that mejnoun had ceased to exist and was she not solicited by the most amiable youth in yemen and was the solemn oath of her venerable father to be lightly regarded had he not sworn that if she accepted not the hand of ebnselan no hope remaining to perpetuate his family honors he would refuse nourishment and close his days by a voluntary death  thou have disgraced us he cried a childless woman is in our race virginity is the glory of the girl but the shame of the woman thou have turned into a desert the fertile soil and dried up the fountain of our race  long inexorable the sufferer offered her life but refused her hand day succeeded day and no messenger from mejnoun arrived her father persisted in his resolution and ceaseless tears were on the face of her mother one day they sat near leila in a mournful silence the eyes of her mother were fixed on her eyes leila could not support the full affection they beamed on her the invisible atoms of sympathy entered her whole frame she became what her mother was and the ardour of her mothers eyes shot to the sanctuary of her pure soul the tears of her mother often lingered amidst her wrinkled cheeks and once she sighed heavily instantly leila sighed convulsively she sunk on her mothers lap and stretched her hand to her old father in silence and in despair she stretched her hand and turning aside her face she wept aloud  the nuptial day arrives the virgin preceded by a splendid retinue and followed by her mother her female relatives and the damsels of her tribe issues from the tent of her father it was a rivalry of arabian magnificence the most precious gums fumed from silver censers the bride appeared under a splendid canopy supported by four men she was veiled from head to foot the crimson veil

the long tassels of silk wrought with gold and silver reached to her feet a herons feather among tufts of smaller plumes was fixed on her head and sometimes gracefully flowed backwards while the quills of the feathers were set in sockets of gold and blazed with gems on either side they flung around scented waters some waved their silken flyflaps some played on their tambourines and many passed on performing agile feats and dancing in various attitudes the women then followed with solemn and processional steps at length a body of musicians appeared and as the music played guns at intervals were fired niebuhr notices the firing of guns at an arabian marriage  and as they ceased the silver voices of the women responded with the joyous cry of lu lu lu then succeeded two camels loaded with her dowry in furniture and followed by the herds the procession went on in a slow march and often paused to receive the salutations of the people  they approach the tents of the expectant

purity of blood from the stud of solomon is proved by a genealogy of two thousand years his gifts were ambitiously arranged on five camels the two processions hailing each other mingled into one  they enter the ornamented tent of ebnselan the contract is ratified before the cadi who performs the nuptial ceremony the two families felicitate each other and the festival spreads along the neighboring valley they prodigally scattered their aspers and their sweetmeats among the eager multitude who shouted as they caught the showery gifts in their extended robe it is an oriental custom to throw handfuls of small coin to the populace at public entertainments economists sometimes purchase bad money beforehand for such purposes and are afterward hissed or applauded by the people in proportion to the real value of their coin  every arab crowned his head with the splendid red flowers of the mimosa whose delicacy and brilliancy are reserved for the nuptial day the sun at length set to the desiring eye of the glowing bridegroom who now was permitted to conduct the beauty to his own tent and to list the veil from her secret charms  ebnselan approached leila and tremblingly raised the veil from the face of the virgin smiles and blushes were not in that face tears are on her cheeks and frowns on her brow his soul shudders and he drops the veil again he returns to leila and with tender reproaches in his eyes would press her to his bosom  stay thy hand exclaimed the virgin in a tone more resolute and awful than ever virgin spoke audacious youth thy hand would steal the fruit that has long matured for another well thou know that leila is mejnouns leila and can be the leila of no other think thou that oaths are mockeries oaths are they not registered in heaven and are there not marriages recorded there which on earth are unconsummated will thou be a serpent in the garden thou may wind round the tree poisoning the fruit thou can not gather i may fear thee but we do not love the thing we fear the injustice of a father has made his daughter a criminal and i am guilty because i am obedient were there not an imbecility in our sex i had died  yet thou may still be kind i am thy bride come then in kindness to thy bride come ebnselan shall i not bless thy name on our nuptial night avert thy face recoil not and strike thy scymitar at my virgin breast point it here i will kiss the point  ebnselan covered his face with his hands  i see continued leila thou have a gentle heart approach me not then and i will live i will forgive thee that thou art my husband  her tones were sweeter for her heart melted as she looked on the gentle ebnselan they restored his spirits and still hoping by acts of tenderness to steal on her affections he clasped her hand and gazed on her with eyes dissolved in fondness and in beauty  approach me not again exclaimed the alarmed leila rash youth the rose thou would pluck will raise its viewless thorns against thee i am the slave of a man forlorn one who is now perhaps the nightcompanion of the hyaena and who gasps with thirst where there are no waters there is nothing but despair about us my vowed soul is in the desert with mejnoun my dreams are restless with his image ebnselan how can i be thine my king lives in my bosom should i turn to thee thou would clasp a polluted woman no i cannot love thee and be chaste ah do we love twice when our first passion is that of despair  ebnselan was the mild inmate of a mild climate he had merited leila had leila to choose a lover he wept silently and at length assured her that he would respect the passion of mejnoun  thou may see he said how i love thee for i consent to feel the grief of a widower on the bridal night and mine eyes while they perceive thy beauties shall only weep for thy misfortunes he quieted the convulsed emotions of leila by a promise to conceal the event of that night such was the amiable forbearance of the tender ebnselan and often the grateful leila met him in tears and would attempt to smile on him while the sufferer as he smiled on her would weep  mejnoun after a long residence in the ruins among which he had concealed himself would sometimes stroll into the open desert and met the traveller the news of the marriage reached him the pilgrim told him of it the voyaging merchant confirmed it and a hunter who had been present at the ceremony minutely described its pomp all censured the capricious maiden and all mourned the inconstancy of the volatile sex at first the incredulous mejnoun conceived the tale to be an artifice to withdraw him from his retreat and often deemed it was a wild notion of his own disordered imagination day followed day and the circumstantial narrative in all its terrible minuteness still afflicted his memory jealousy and indignation exalted his delirium he knows nothing of the trials of leila of that resistless persecution when a silent parent perishes before the eye of filial piety and still less of her inviolate affection and the not inferior sufferings of ebnselan he is alive only to the idea of her union and in the anger of phrenzy he pictures them happy and himself scorned those who had informed him of their union well knew the long persecutions she had suffered but these were as nothing in their mind while they had the pleasure of forming another splendid accusation of the infidelity of the sex and could console themselves for disappointments themselves had received and had merited every one added to his account inconsciously some little provoking circumstance such as they themselves had experienced and such as they imagined every perjured woman practiced  all these had been lovers but not lovers like mejnoun circumstances which excited their laughter jarred on and were most touching to his soul an incident unconnected in their minds was associated with former emotions by the enthusiast and an event which they conceived as common seemed to him for a long time as impossible he formed the terrible project of disguising himself in the habit of a pilgrim and concealing a poignard to enter her tent and perish with her at the same moment and with the same instrument he composed the following poetical epistle and sent it by a hunter mejnoun in the desert to the perjured leila perfidious and thou live anothers bride and veilest thy guilty head in nuptial pride where is thy vow in fond devotion given it burns upon the chronicle of heaven on that black page where fate recoiling shows treasons impieties and atheist vows once once i deemed i woke supremely blessed romantic fondness in a female breast fine seemed the sense thy pliant spirit caught a trembling pleasure and a silent thought our serious sentiment respired in sighs sweetness of heart and tenderness of eyes how often inconscious of the waning hour i still recalled thee to the parting bower studious to lose thee in each tangled walk so to prolong thy soft seducing talk what meaning songs thou badst my heart apply as moved with secret love thy talking eye lo if i blushed on the inflamed snow of thy fair cheek my blushes seemed to glow often as i slept thy silent hand would strew over me the mantling flowers of every hue once as i woke a loved enchantment spread thine arm the winding pillow of my head then faint my opening lids were sealed in bliss closed by the warmth of an ambrosial kiss on me in vain would wanton beauties try the sorcery of a lightlyrolling eye as still my heart thy secret portrait warms that wondrous amulet disturbed their charms often the keen taunt their froliclaughter aimed for when some maid i called twas thee i named mark springs green hands that prodigally rear for its lorn bird the virgins of the year his pensive heart with lonely passion glows and all he flies and sighs but for the rose you may place an hundred handfuls of fragrant herbs and flowers before the nightingale yet he wishes not in his constant heart for more than the sweet breath of his beloved

blessed the moles soft shadow on thy cheek black moles on the face have been long considered as a singular beauty in the east we have only to look into the persian and arabian poets for innumerable instances of the enthusiasm with which they admired this fancied elegance ornamental patches are perhaps a fashion among others which were probably borrowed from asia for whenever a beauty is highly prized the ladies substitute some artificial imitation when deprived of the natural charm  thy creased chin voluptuous over thy neck then thy harmonious blood blushed on that cheek and wrote the vow ere thou the vow could speak twice thou did kiss me and in silence held our knitted hands to heaven  and heaven beheld then thou did swear and raise thy dewy eye to fly the world for loves eternity and sweetly whispered in the secret shade  earth shows no monster like a perjured maid why from the harmonious lip and blushing cheek did heaven permit a pestilence to break while my hot soul drank up

face it looks thy tenderness it moves thy grace o modest lonely beauty of the night of lovers and of saints the grateful light thou to the inspired paintst every vision warm give voice to silence and to shade a form but lo in more than dreams to thee i turn weep as i smile and shiver as i burn a dubious being scarce these veins supply life that lives not and death that will not die that comfort

and curse his holy beam i fly my armed tents and social bowers for thee and count on rocks the lingering hours more sweet than pleasure and than power more strong i quit the fame that crowns my polished song and in a desert strangling glorys voice i feel the madness and approve the choice yet scorn me not nor yield a proud relief there is a majesty in lonely grief ah do thou scorn  yes yes thou scornst secure a hermitmejnoun for a paramour but heaven is just and sure such human pain shall give remorse when thou would yield disdain leila to mejnoun and thou live thou live mejnoun and thy leila can never be thine but think not she is anothers behold me married yet a widowed virgin respect the mysterious avowal should thy rival be parched with the thirst that consumes him he shall not taste of the fountain whose pure waters never ran but for thee the brilliant pearl is still in its shell and it is guarded by my life  but thy rival is gentle ah it is this which afflicts me oh that he were but a tyrant that i might complain that i could hate yes ebnselan is worthy of thy affection with him i should be grateful but my heart lacerated from thine has lost one of its virtues and it can scarcely feel gratitude for him to whom i owe every thing in life every thing but thyself  how often i dismiss my maidens to sit alone and as the evening steals over the dusky air picture thee in the forms that play among the clouds then lost in thought i seem to view the desert thou treadest the gray sands the brown rocks and as a shadow runs along variable and quick that shadow to mine eyes is thy restless form i gaze on some vast mountain i see thee on its point then the mountain melts into a vapor and thou art for ever snatched from mine eyes oh then i weep and weep then i feel every thorn that rankles in thy hermit feet i shrink in every blast that parches thy solitary form often as thy tears fall on thy face be assured mine too is covered with tears how often do i change the neckkerchief wet with weeping how often do i refuse my meal when i think thou art without aliment  be not my beloved unjust to me are thy misfortunes greater than mine i feel my grief cannot last at times my heart is so heavy that i have often fixed on the day of my death  a poor woman my love is confined to her melancholy tent no intervening object breaks the unvaried deadness she quietly sits with a viewless serpent round her heart then it is i say to myself  awhile be patient my soul the evening of thy departure arrives patience mejnoun is a plant of bitter growth but it will bear on its head a sweet fruit  while thus i am confined to one sad spot thou my love art free to wander thou have liberty at least in thy sorrows surely liberty moderates grief i once heard a poor dervise say that in liberty he forgot his poverty  i who have never known what is liberty imagine it is happiness thou inhabitest the mountains and thou can change thy mountain as thou choosest thou wanderest on the plains and thou can repose thyself when thou willest it is true thou sit down only to weep alas my love i sit and i weep all day mine eye views no new object my feet find no new path there is no interval to the tremors of my heart thou talkest to the echoes even this is something i would rather talk to an echo in sorrow as we are than converse with those human beings who have made us unhappy how keen is that pang of the tender heart when it finds itself compelled to shut itself up and can love nothing that surrounds it  but thou have beloved of my soul that which can give to solitude a million of sensations and which makes all its spots a temple of nature thou know i mean that genius which commands our arabian hearts thy verses are remembered the whole world sympathise with thy sufferings and thy wanderings but i am only born to be the means of thy immortality myself not immortal i feel and i think and i weep like thee but i must conceal the same sentiments and stifle the same sighs and feel my heart break in silence ere i dare to avow all it thinks  it will not avail to tell thee how i became the wife of another an unjust father reproached me a heartbroken mother sat beside me an amiable youth prayed to me i had no friend a father a mother and a lover they deceived me spare spare the recital mejnoun ebnselan became my husband  my father and my mother live do thou curse an affectionate daughter believe me i sought to die but nature was more powerful than i and thou know how my heart is tender can thou blame a tenderness that makes me adore thee i feel for thee i felt for them most miserable of my sex alike the victim of obedience or disobedience  mejnoun still am i thine my virginsoul is thine mejnoun while i live i am thine oh mejnoun how i love to repeat that tenderest of names i love thee with a thousand souls    this epistle gave to mejnoun the emotions of desponding constancy in the delirium of passion each period received a tear and sometimes a kiss and grasping the letter till every syllable was effaced he held the fragments to his eyes while his memory supplied the passages he could no more distinguish  often the tender maniac addressed the echo and often asked who was the most unfortunate himself or his mistress while often he hated the voice of the echo because it was his own voice  deceitful sympathy he cried thou reply to my sighs thou repeatest my words and what art thou but air hollow is thy heart and mockery is in thy voice and yet to the solitary how consoling even the shadow of the human voice the sense of leilas sufferings seemed to tranquillize his own and he paused in the violence of his own emotions while he remembered those of his mistress softened into a still melancholy he flew into an obscure nook pale and haggard there sitting whole days immovable he would have seemed a statue had he not sighed  his abode was now not unknown and many a messenger had come from his father imploring his return but mejnoun was inexorable the old chief amidst his tents felt himself as desolated as his hermit son the fond hope of posterity that solitary hope of age was extinct another victim to these unhappy loves his noble and paternal heart was broken in the chill of approaching death the solitary idea which occupied his closing hours was the desire of once more embracing his miserable son who but lebid could prevail with mejnoun yet the journey might be fatal to the venerable man the dying chief softly grasped the hand of his friend and looked in his face and was silent he suspired the name of mejnoun in a sigh half suppressed lebid that day ordered a camel and departed for the hermit  he discovered his dark cavern he lay there stretched without motion and in the twilight gloom the effendi imagines he views his corpse he raised a loud cry as mejnoun rose he embraced him  thou live yet cried the old tremulous man thy father perishes his soul struggles to live a day that he may yet once more view thee is the tenderest passion to disnature thy breast mysterious heaven permittest thou two human beings to love like these  mejnoun my friend my child speak thy father thou know not he has been a father to thee trust me thou know not all hasten and be the vision of his deathbed miserable man i only invite thee to the scene of death come thy cherished hand may yet close his heavy eyes in sweetness  mejnoun gazed on lebid with leaden and spiritless eyes he fondly listened to him and quietly followed him tears and embraces they exchanged but words they could not utter  they journeyed on till the exhausted effendi could not proceed he hung his shrivelled arms around the neck of mejnoun his feeble tones died in murmurs on his lips  proceed thy father has not many hours to live lay me under this planetree i shall be found fear not it is better for me to die under that planetree than be carried home lifeless it will spare our friends some sorrows the death of a friend is soon forgotten but the view of his corpse long startles the memory go my child remember thou have a mother still when thy father dies  the distracted mejnoun in vain offers to quit the camel and to hasten on foot to his tents but this would have prolonged his journey many days the old effendi was now speechless the camel would not go without its driver the moments pressed on him  shall i leave a dying father here to hasten to a father who is perhaps dead exclaimed the miserable man but he thought of his mother he remembered the effendis words and stretching the old man under the planetree he placed beside him a bardak of water and he journeyed wailing along the desert  he reaches his tents he flies to that of his father he yet lives his eyes halfclosed in the sleep of death yet open on his icy lips his voice yet trembles in the arms of his son a new warmth stays his fleeting existence  they look on each other a thousand silent things mejnoun as he was turned to his dying father supported his head his mother seated on the couch laid her face on the back of her son and moaned  my father cried mejnoun and could say no more  my son hollowly replied the father let me touch thee i have ceased to see  i had much to say to thee continued with difficulty the dying man the hectic of death faintly gleamed on his face  it came it past i have not seen thee two years and thou have come a day too late thy mother knows what i would say mejnoun turned to his mother her face was raised to him covered with tears and scarcely knowing what he did he passed his hand over her face and wiped away her tears  may alla preserve continued the dying man in tones still feebler from disastrous love the virtuous and the valiant o my son behold us alike its victims he laid his head on the arm of his son and expired  mejnoun turns to his lifeless parent and still tries to recall the voice he can hear no more he lifts his arm and it is stiffened he feels his hand and no pulses tremble there he touches his blue lips and they are as ice his whole body remained in heaviness cold in his embrace  when his parent ceased to exist he heard of all the proofs and sufferings of his affections but his heart was wrung with that severest of all agonies that which the most affectionate son feels when he has broken the heart of the tenderest parent even leila was banished from his thoughts  and why cried mejnoun is the goodness of man known only when it avails not to be known i ceased to be a son because i knew not i had a father heaven how mysterious are thy decrees  alas replied his mother thou did cease to be every thing when thou were only a lover  he dispatched two messengers one to search for lebid the other to bring news from leila  the effendi had been assisted by the charity of a hermit dervise who in vain entreated him to retire within his cave and share his meal and his orisons no replied the old man i will not quit this planetree those that left me here will one day return to find me i have friends holy man who will not forget me the dervise who had never known such friends imagined that the feeble old man was crazed with sorrow and every day as he brought him refreshments and still found him there smiled and said  trust me no one remembers a friend in a desert  if that be true replied the effendi it were best that i should die under this planetree every day the old effendi watched and the messenger found him waiting his coming under the planetree  to the wisdom of lebid mejnoun confided the care of his mother and his tribe his mind had now become associated to the desert his delirium found repose amid familiar horrors and he once more returns to his seclusion where he appointed an interview with the friend he had sent to the tents of leila  day after day elapsed and still no messenger from leila arrived he sat upon the point of a rock that he might discover the expected friend before he reached him at length he descries one approaching he ran down the rock and met him on the plain it was his friend who when he perceived mejnoun approached him with slow steps and heavy looks the heart of mejnoun was chilled at the aspect of so melancholy a messenger and with a bewildered air he inquires the fate of leila his friend replied but by a profound sigh  thy silence well becomes thy tale said mejnoun why is not all for me an eternal silence here i have waited day after day but to hear of the death of leila could that heart that tender heart love as she loved and live a thousand times already have i mourned her death and when the world told me she yet lived often i was incredulous  alas replied the friend rejoicing to observe the calmness with which the mejnoun spoke a fixed grief preyed on her soul and   talk not talk not quickly the mejnoun replied with eyes that emitted sparks of passion while his hand rudely repulsed his friend did i not commend thy silence away it is dangerous to commend a fools silence he will speak at last were it but to give a fools thanks away i am sick of all foolery away to thy world to thy world fool  he paused his troubled heart was busied with gloomy imaginations his rapid lips muttered low and inarticulate accents his eyes were fixed on the earth he sighed and said  it is completed it was born and it has died the flower is gathered let the leaves the lovely stem supported fall and rot on the earth  he mused terrible thoughts were in his mind and the blood sorsook his face  he shrieks he rolls himself on the burning sands his friend approaches and would embrace him but he hurls him to the earth he flies up the perpendicular rock he howls and the echo multiplies his terrific voice some hunters join his friend three days they patiently watch at the foot of the rock on the second day the voice of mejnoun was only heard at intervals on the third night in the gleam of the moon they perceived the spectreman descending the dying form paced slowly with tottering steps every step was audible in the vast silence their hearts shuddered the mejnoun looked not of this earth and they dared not approach him he reached a hillock of sand and stretched himself in silence they hasten to the mejnoun on his murmuring lips they listened to the name of leila and slowly and hollowly they heard one vast and feeble sigh and it ceased to respire his friend placed his hand on the bosom of the mejnoun and his heart no more palpitated  the last solemn office of friendship was paid by the hands of his unhappy friend and the grieving hunters returning to the tents of ebnselan he summons the tribe and tells a tale often interrupted by his moaning auditors even the obdurate emir in whose subdued breast no human passion now beat but that of pity vows a long sad pilgrimage to mecca and thanks the prophet that he is old and will soon die the gentle ebnselan rose and wept and spoke  sad messenger of disastrous love another and a final duty still remains thou know not that the dying leila predicted the death of mejnoun he lives she said but because i live and he will die because i shall have died it was her last prayer that their ashes should be united lead us to his grave they shall meet though they meet in death and over their extinct ashes let me pour my living tears  the tribe of mejnoun unite with the tribe of leila at the foot of the rock which the mejnoun haunted in his delirium they raise a tomb to the memory of the lovers and there depositing the bodies they plant around many a gloomy cypress tree lebid lived to compose the verses which were embossed with golden characters on the black marble lebid lived to lament his own fostering of their loves ahmeds austerity and the emirs haughtiness  for many successive years the damsels of the two tribes in sympathising groupes annually assembled at the cemetery and planted in marble vases around the tomb aromatic flowers and herbs one night in every year each bearing a taper they wailed till the morning the fate of the lovers and in parting prayed their parents to be merciful in love the caravans of syria and egypt which traverse the desert in their way to mecca once stopped near the consecrated spot the tender pilgrim once leant over their tomb and read and wept the spot is now only known by tradition the monument has left no vestige and the trees no more wave their melancholy boughs nothing remains but the history of the lovers the turks have a great veneration for the dead their cemeteries are surrounded with a cypress grove and inscriptions with appropriate verses embossed with raised letters gilded and contrasted by a black or green ground a stone chest is placed between them filled with aromatic flowers and herbs which are planted there and regularly cultivated by the females of the family who assemble in groupes for that duty this mark of respect is particularly shown to the dead unmarried young it is of the highest antiquity amongst the polished and the ruder nations and surely none can be more elegant and appropriate  dallaways constantinople p      i conclude these notes by observing that the catastrophe of this romance has nothing in it extraordinary or violent to the ardent feelings of an oriental lover richardson has observed that the arabians and the tartars by their attachment to pastoral life ever favorable to love and the circumstances peculiar to their roving habits frequently produce such situations many tribes are often encamped together and the young men of one fall naturally in love with the damsels of another in the midst of their courtship the heads of the tribes suddenly order the tents to be struck one goes to the right hand and one to the left the lovers are thus separated perhaps never more to meet and if we may at all trust to their elegies or their language those separations have been often fatal dying for love is considered amongst us as a mere poetic figure but in eastern countries it is something more many words in the arabic and persian languages which express love imply also melancholy madness and death     the end of mejnoun and leila love and humility a roman romance advertisement a roman triumph and the amor of a grecian slave for her prince are objects not so remote from our domestic feelings as may at first appear the procession to st pauls to commemorate our ever glorious naval victories was so destitute of the picturesque to charm the enlightened eye of taste and so wanting of those objects which can communicate even to the bosom of the simplest citizen a patriotic enthusiasm that i could not help meditating on the full the varied and the majestic picture of a roman triumph  the situation of aciloe and his lover in this romance is only that in which more than one noble emigrant has been placed i know one who had taught himself to forget the world in the neat cottage of a farmer but his sensibility was greater than his fortitude and lacerated from all he cherished he became dangerously ill by the devoted tenderness of the farmers daughter whose natural talents he had refined with exquisite taste he recovered his health as he recovered the farmers daughter became every day more pallid more dejected and at length was menaced with a confirmed marasmus no one suspected the cause of her visible decay she never complained the conversation of the noble emigrant often turned on the splendid history of the french court and the stern dignity of his own family allied to the royal blood the race is marked let him pardon the expression with that haughtiness which is the germ of many heroic virtues he himself would be proud did not the tenderness of his feelings struggle with his hereditary glory to all he said the farmers daughter listened with too fond an attention and while the malady of her heart for the infection breathed in her heart inflamed itself but the more at such discourse she felt that the hind that would be mated by the lion must die for love   this situation occasioned love struggling with humility and when i composed this romance i thought of them  love and humility a roman romance paulus aemilius returning from the conquest of macedonia his triumph is opposed by servius galba  the heroic conduct of marcus servilius  the triumph  behavior of galba and his adherents the loves of the slave leucothoe and aciloe prince of macedon  it speaks the sufferings of a female slave who long had brooded silent as the grave over love that racked her soul with ceaseless pain oberon canto xi stanza    the venerable and sublime paulus aemilius now returned from the final conquest of the macedonian empire rome in awful silence awaited the decree of the senate for the triumph  the assembled spoils of nations aemilius had not profaned the general had only permitted his sons to share among themselves the library of perseus the king of macedon and they preferred manuscripts to vases of gold they now returned neither solicitous nor ambitious of the triumph they returned but to hasten to their paternal farm whose smoke wreathing in their natal air was to them an object more cherished than the pomp of a triumph there sixteen of this hero race subsisted and the hands of consuls guided the plough but the glare of splendor and treasures hitherto unknown corrupted the army and the soldiers in returning to rome murmured at the severe justice of aemilius who had only combated for his country and with an affectionate pride yielded all his labors to the maternal city conducted and inflamed by servius galba they mutinied they ranged the city they surrounded the capitol they menaced the tribunes they contemned the senate they opposed the voice of the people it seemed to the romans that their soldiers had returned not to rejoice in their victories but themselves to take possession of rome  the voluble and sarcastic galba calumniated the hoary general it was then marcus servilius rose servilius of consular dignity whose arm had so often triumphed in single combat he rose and with the energetic truth of heroism reminded the roman people what paulus aemilius had performed for them during more than half the life of man it is not fit he proceeded that lilyskinned men whose unbruised shields are worn only on festal days and whose tongues are more dangerous than their swords should dare to talk of generals and of triumphs before you oh my friends that we had no orators but those whose eloquence were written where their hearts beat in saying this he flung open his robe and displayed a breast scaled with scars the martial exploits of servilius rushing into their minds the soldiers bowed while their shields in touching each other gave a solemn sound marcus had certain swellings in his body galba pointed and derided  thou deridest me said the whitehaired consul for what i hold as honorable for me as the wreath of laurel i claim for aemilius for you fellowcitizens incessantly by day and by night i traveled and i fought and the pain i still receive from these is to me a sensation of glory as for aemilius i know him well he will lament this triumph as an interruption of his return to his farm for it only delights him to tread the field of war or the field of peace but we romans are to be just even to those who exact not justice we are to seek the glory which in vain would conceal itself proceed galba collect thy votes i will follow thee to note down the degenerate and the ingrate and may my last accent be that of reproach to the roman who votes against the triumph of aemilius he ceased the army shouted aemilius is godlike servius galba slunk away and lost himself among the crowd and all the tribes decreed the triumph of aemilius  and now the soldiers dispersing mingled with the people ancient friends had scarcely time to seek each other and embrace ere the sound of erecting scaffolds to view the triumphal march echoed through the city the triumph was decreed to last three days of roman triumphs the only detail we have is i believe left us by livy which plutarch copied in his life of paulus aemilius in the picture of this triumph i have combined the most striking incidents montesquieu with his happy conciseness says romulus and his successors were engaged in perpetual wars with their neighbors they returned to their city with their spoils consisting of wheatsheaves and flocks this filled them with the greatest joy such is the origin of triumphs to which that city afterward chiefly owed its grandeur     at length the day arrived and rome assembled ere the sun had risen the people clad in white garments hurrying along in masses now rolling now floating looked like the tumult of a sea the windows and the porches of houses were crowded some were seated on domes some had climbed on columns and some were clinging to slender ballustrades another rome seemed hanging in the air every thing on which the eye could rest was adorned every citizen hung out from his windows carpets of purple and gold and placed on his walls pictures of value the streets were strewed with flowers the temples were fancifully embellished with boughs the statue of every god was crowned with a garland and all the air was sweet with the fuming incense from the altars to the eye almost deceived it seemed as if a magic grove had risen in one night an object not less interesting than rome thus ornamented was the view of all its beauties leaning on the balconies scattering odoriferous flowers and twining wreaths of laurel for the approaching victor  and now the lictors marched with their axes and their rods opening a passage on the first day of the triumph two hundred and fifty cars were filled with the brilliant miracles of grecian art pictures which as they passed seemed like mirrors to reflect some existing scene of nature and colossal statues whose view gave a new conception of humanity and as they passed so finely were the passions chisseled that they inspired lovers who sighed at their beauty or awed votarists with a religious trembling this must be understood literally both in the past and in the present age there have been men who were lovers of statues coyer in his voyage ditalie exclaims with equal vivacity and truth certainement cest une providence que les femmes de la nature ne valent pas celles de lart    soothing and delicious were the emotions of the roman people on that day on the second vast was the crashing sound of the iron wheels of numerous wains that contained the arms and the armor of the macedonians with artful negligence they had loosely heaped the martial instruments and they rang loudly and glittered confusedly against each other helmets and targets and javelins and shields and cuirasses and the points of naked swords formed a shining terror while the spectators even trembled at the view of the arms of the conquered when all these had passed their terrific sound remained but they were soon delighted by innumerable vessels holding the coined silver each supported by four men oppressed by the massive weight the procession closed with an exhibition artfully arranged of sculptured vases inestimable for their beauty and even singular for their value that day diffused not the pleasure of the former they had viewed nothing but objects of terror and objects of wealth it was on the third and last day that the human passions were awakened by objects of humanity  at first they started in terror the trumpets and the clarions did not sound a flourish as on a festal day but blew such a charge as they were accustomed when they excited their soldiers to battle it was insantly rumoured and imagined that the army had again mutinied and rome as if she felt herself in desolation quaked and quailed to her heart but soon the modest and regulated steps of the martial musicians turned consternation into confidence and a breathless tranquillity it was now the romans securely indulged their eye and their heart  after the heralds and trumpeters succeeded young men in flaxen robes with their arms and bosoms bare leading more than a hundred stalled oxen whose horns were gilded and whose backs were adorned with bandelets interlaced with sestoons of flowers these victims lashed their long tails joyously sensible of the pomp and perhaps thinking it would lead them to their pastures then followed beautiful boys whose chins had yet no down and their tresses floating luxuriantly on their shoulders each bearing a vessel of the lustral water now marched soldiers carrying the coined gold and the antique and massy vases from the royal treasures at some interval the car of perseus the conquered monarch was trained that regal throne was now a solitude and nothing was viewed in it but on the seat his armor and his diadem behind walked the family of perseus of whom the most remarkable was aciloe his eldest son the matrons and the virgins of rome wept as they gazed on his beauty and the intendering melancholy that shaded his touching physiognomy muffled in a black mantle perseus appeared his head was bare his hands and his feet clanked with chains of iron he leant his head on his breast but those who were near him saw with contempt and some with pity his dark eyes suffused with a red flame and hatred ignominy and despair torturing his horrid physiognomy perseus the coward and the tyrant who refused the death he was offered  thou art not said an old roman as he passed thou art not worthy to be permitted to die composing a romance i was not willing to copy the page of the historian but livy the most picturesque of romancers describes perseus more strikingly his words are to this purpose he resembled one struck by thunder one in whom the greatness of his griefs had taken away the very feeling     at length a gayer spectacle charmed four hundred crowns of gold presented to aemilius from as many cities or as tributes or as gifts now glittered in the air and now a hollow murmur went along the crowd the triumphal car appeared and the people shouted it was ornamented with a magnificence that seemed the emblem of the genius of its hero clothed in purple wrought with golden flowers the venerable form of aemilius sat and extending his right hand held a laurel branch there was a sadness in his countenance too penetrating for even the magnanimity of that hero to conceal that week the week of his triumph pestilence spread her midnight wing over his house and some had died and some were dying and his domestic roof was a tomb so fortune wars with man tears were sometimes seen on his cheek the whole army followed with branches of laurel in their hands some chaunting the culogy of their general and some pointing at him their sharpest railleries and thus the triumph of aemilius closed  when the procession ended servius galba remained surrounded by a few malicious spirits who till the army passed had hoped the mutiny would again have broken out in the course of the triumph for some time they gazed on each other in silence and dejection galba then addressed them  what is the freedom of speech denied a roman citizen my friends this is a scene for us to ridicule it merits not our anger and this then is the glory of our tremendous hero and the great aemilius is ambitious of becoming the chief actor in a state pantomime by hercules for a handful of sesterces i will hire you a hero dressed in a lambskin and a sooty face his mimi shall beat our generals o jove thy tunic was profaned this day it is this my friends which rouses indignation that the roman people should bend their supple knee to whomever the senate decrees honors imbecil and superstitious like egyptians we worship calves when they tell us they are sanctified i hate the senate by all the gods i swear this senate corruptors and corrupted minions of the patricians oh that we had no senate or that every citizen were a senator that day should be marked with white that were a day to thank jupiter and to be sure the gods are much concerned with the victories of us romans who carry our oppression wherever we can lead an army and who would even take possession of the seats of the gods themselves had they but given us the wings of our eagles  in this manner galba and his adherents exhaled their bile and retiring from the happy metropolis that night at supper their falernian wine tasted like gall in their mouth the bitter thought of envy was in their hearts that bitter thought which communicates even to the face of man a yellow hue but in the city of rome they danced in circles and carolled in chorus that night no eye was closed in rome the streets blazing with torches gave a midnight sun while in the shadowy groves silvered by a sweet moonlight murmured many an amorous kiss  historians have not informed us of the fate of aciloe the son of perseus the narrative of love by an aged female slave at the distance of fifty years after the triumph of aemilius in tracing the progress of a passion at once most tender and most humble preserves some part of his secret history it was thus the female slave addressed her companions   ye virgins instruct yourselves in love as ye listen to my tale not mine the pomp of wealth or the vainer pomp of birth war had even deprived me of my native valley born in macedon i scarcely remember the warmth of my natal sun from youth to age i have lived a slave at rome nor have i wished a more indulgent life for in the arms of a lover slavery can please  ye have heard of aciloe the prince of macedon he became the slave of antonius and for three olympiads he was my companion greece that had given him birth had also given him her arts and her beauty those arts which subdued the souls of her conquerors and that beauty which perpetuated by her statues will tell remotest ages what men peopled that elysian climate the beauty of the men in greece and their gymnastic contests were the causes of the excellence of their artists the personal beauty the naked elegance of nature and the amenity of their soil and their climate developed and nourished their imaginations and gave birth to every fine art plato describes with enthusiasm certain youths who were sent as ambassadors to the persian court and exults that no nation could produce such celestial forms diogenes laertius in vain and powerless language would paint the enchanting figure of the celebrated xenophon this personal beauty formed a distinction between the elevated and the lower ranks the latter lost their fine forms in labor and misery  de pauw vol i p  0   yes aciloe was accomplished apollo had melodised his tongue with persuasion and the music of his happy lyre was various as it was fine venus had breathed over him her purple light and his complexion was like roses that bathed in milk sparkle with the snowy dew and minerva had given to his intendering countenance those humid and tremulous eyes whose blue seriousness to look on edulcorates the heart  i viewed the fairfaced youth bending in tasks of strength with an elegance that far other tasks required they doubled his labors cruel romans tyrannical freemen they would annihilate princes as if princes were not men i have seen the amiable youth blush at his feebleness i never heard him murmur in servitude beneath a foreign heaven his frame but not his mind lost its energy the liberal soul no chain can rivet no toil can dismay  but laborious days and sorrowing nights clouded his spirit and crushed his too exquisite frame he sat alone and heavy and longdrawn were his sighs his cheeks had lost their downy bloom and they looked as if their winter had succeeded their spring the wavering light of his eyes was decaying as the faint flame trembles in the lamp his flaxen ringlets glistening like threads of gold and throwing a soft shadow over his delicate forehead now neglected no more danced in wavy curls but were tangled in despair his soul sickened with melancholy i gazed i trembled as i traced a pale consumption like the secret miner sapping silently and unseen  touched by his misery i felt the injustice of fortune i desired to console him but when i remembered that the slave had been my prince my heart recoiled with awe a natural air of majesty breathed in his least gesture nature designed him for a prince his eye commanded though his tongue was silent  has not nature created some men capable of imparting felicity to a whole people oh were aciloe i thought on his throne the sun would look cheerful to desolated macedonia such were my thoughts perhaps the thoughts of a slave for are not all equals when they meet in misery ah the miserable want not respect they only claim compassion  at length so much he interested me that i felt nothing but pity one day the prince was winowing corn already the star of venus had risen and half the days task yet remained exanimate he dropped the flail he sat down and covered his face with his hands i approached with eyes fixed on the ground and tremulous footsteps i knelt before him  aciloe behold a macedonian oh prince thou have yet one faithful subject he raised his face flushed with a saint crimson and wiped away the tear on his burning cheek he smiled with a tender grace ye gods that first smile which entered my heart still vibrates on its fibers as if my mutual labor had inspired him that evening he seemed to have forgotten macedon  learn ye maidens that in the gentle offices of pity so sweet are the pleasures we love to repeat them beware my friends of that softsouled power pity ye know is the sister of love ah often she betrays us into her brothers power that volatile boy of heaven whose smiling eyes are malicious and whose very sports are cruel yes love stole from pity the spark he touched into a flame  i dared to love aciloe i loved but i resolved to perish ere i would tell my love  the earth now seemed for ever to deny me tranquillity and i sought for it in heaven and in hell i knew an old woman of thessaly she was a great enchantress she once gave a philtre for a maid administered by the hand of her lover who for ten years had in vain sprinkled libations of wine at her door and covered the walls of his house with her cherished name she drank it and she loved but her passion was distracted her senses were injured it was a love without modesty and she expired in the arms of her miserable lover i preferred the mild rites of incantation she gave me a waxen image she told me to call it by the name of him i loved and to place it near the fire and as it turned and melted with the heat he too would turn and melt whose name it bore i turned the image i blessed it as it dissolved drop by drop and the next day i sought aciloe with eager joy but alas the heat had not reached him i told the old thessalian and she said  unhappy maid hell has no remedy for thy love i had dreams by night i related them to the augurs and they told me to supplicate the god of love what incense breathed what turtles bled on his altar i told the augurs that the god was inexorable do thou not see they replied that when thou sacrificest nothing but smoke and vapors are rolled about the altar forget thyself unhappy maid heaven is not thy friend  yet i could not despair the pains of love are not without pleasure yet his pleasures are full of pain much i desired little hoped and nothing asked brama assai poco spera e nulla chiede a verse from tasso so descriptive of a modest passion it is omitted by hoole     have ye not all worshipped the apollo of praxiteles has not its enchanting illusion possessed your senses surely the god sculptured his own statue the flexible softness of that marble where the blood seems moving in the veins the airy harmony in the proportions which to the deceived eye gives the sense of motion the celestial smile on those halfopened lips which makes one incline as if to listen softened form of the green spring of life thine is eternal youth the health of a divinity brilliant yet tender as the opening dawn i have gazed on the sculptured god till i thought it glided in the air is not such the statue of apollo and such ye virgins was the form of aciloe  familiarised to my services he almost conversed with me as an equal but often a dignity in his air and a majesty in his conceptions separated from his my humbled spirit yet he deigned to accept my attentions i hastened my own labors to conclude his unfinished tasks and aciloe was restored to health he recovered his vivacity mine sunk as his recovered the finest form in nature seemed to start from the remains of its decay i would have given a treasure for a bracelet of his hair as i gazed on the shining whiteness of his neck while a loose ringlet that had fallen from the rest threw its soft shadow how often i sighed to weave it round my fingers  i felt myself perishing i slumbered in halfawakened dreams i started in tremors i was lost in reverie i rose weary in the morning as if the night had been a night of toil i looked on the sun and it cheered me not i gazed on aciloe and all my senses burned oppressed by my own labors when i toiled for aciloe that labor seemed to restore me aciloe saw my dejection and suffered me not to toil oh the change now the pining shadow of what i was aciloe warm in health and gratitude labored for me he would inquire the cause of my concealed dejection i sound no voice but i selt the blood paint my cheek  sometimes my love was not without hope and i imagined aciloe had discovered the secret of my heart but i checked the delightful thought when i recollected that gratitude is a shade of love one day from the villa he sent me by a slave returning to the city a garland accompanied by a brilliant painting of the flowers as he had interwoven them i knew not which to admire the creation of nature or the work of art when each is perfect nature touches and art charms i sighed to think that the slowers of aciloe would die that evening looking on the border of the picture i read this inscription living we were cherished dead we still exist   ah i exclaimed how the sympathetic aciloe can interpret at a distance the thoughts of my soul but a thought more melancholy touched me  that i should soon die after them and the garland dropped from my cold and slackened hand reflecting thus mournfully i found in the garland this scroll fade not like these flowers for no painting can supply thy loss the artist can trace outlines and can catch tints but he cannot paint the thoughts of thy mind he cannot give another existence to the virtues of thy soul   about this time i became solicitous of my dress would ye agitate the heart of your lover be dress the unperceived labor of your days think of it every morning ere ye rise vary it with new forms warm it with new colors trust me one day ye will observe how the eye of your lover shall linger about you how all that day restless in ecstasy he will mention objects which have the same color as your dress that dress remember well when at some distant day ye shall be estranged from each other then to kindle the heart of the cherished traitor appear in the same dress be the colors the same and your smiles the same ye will then see how easy it is to wind around an affectionate heart  as for myself i was but a slave and costly ornaments were not mine i could not wear the purple dye of tire nor the light tissues of the isle of cos nor were my tresses essenced with the oronthean myrrh but cheaper colors may enchant and simpler graces may seduce sometimes i was dressed with the lightest azure beautiful as the serenest sky or with the palest rose color delicate as the youngest of those tender flowers or with a chaste white floating redundant on the ground as if i had thrown over me a woven snow  i sought to delight him by those tender artifices which recalled to him the memory of his natal soil often he had viewed with rapture on the winding banks of the eurotas the virgins confining their loose drapery and rejecting their veiling peplos in their courses and their games and their dances half their impatient bosom peered above their vest and their naked knee and their gracile legs glided with easy grace i assembled my companions and taught them the grecian dance of ariadne or the labyrinth i holding a garland was their leader while the large circle hand in hand moved slowly around me then more animated they would coil about me pressing each against the other i waved my garland i eluded their grasping hands i extricated myself by artful feints and winding through them i escaped and triumphed then i yielded my place to the next and thus all had the same garland but all had not the same glory at another time it was a rural dance i represented flora and my hair was starred with roses i often bade the dance cease to chaunt the tender hymn of spring and then each maiden would take a rose from my hair and when all my roses were despoiled my hymn closed but aciloe was not delighted by our dances on the banks of my own eurotas he said they inflamed my soul but a grecian dance in rome only provokes my indignation  and yet there was a little spot we had discovered which he cherished it circled the palatine hills after our toiling day delicious was each evening hour as wandering there we saw the flocks obey the call of the shepherds doric reed up the sides of one of those hills climbed the pendent vineyards along an expansive lake winded green walks fringed with the arbutus and the myrtle while still lower were the olive grounds whose gloomy umbrage the setting sun warmed with its roseate hue above us were groves of pine and silver firs here often aciloe turned away from haughty and imperial rome its temples its amphitheatres its xysti and its forums he turned away and some natural tears fell as he gazed on the cherished spot the cherished spot it was a grecian scenery the very semblance of one where he was born how grateful in a foreign country he exclaimed to find a home scene rome has not deprived us of all our greece at least it yields one spot which brings me back to the lost earth where i was cradled  with hope almost extinct in my bosom i could no more labor and my master bade me retire to die aciloe often stole to my sick couch he wept beside me and the prince tended a slave how often i thought i viewed the infernal bark on the borders of the styx as often would the dulcet voice of aciloe recall me to existence  how vital the breath of him we love if i were extinct and my lover breathed on my lips i have often thought it would revive my inanimate corpse  it was thou said aciloe when death was terrible for the iron of slavery then first rankled in my indignant soul it was thou who gently stolest away the thorns of a sick pillow thus given life had its value though its price was slavery what is the viewless canker in thy heart thy malady is not that of nature but that of passion for thou have ever been happy thou have never known freedom and slavery for thee has no pains it was something sudden that marred thy harmonious nerves and broke the joy of thy smooth check when i recovered it was then thou did lose thy health surely the infection of anothers grief is not fatal by hercules i will not accept the existence purchased by thy death live then live it is thy prince who bids thee live  as aciloe spoke my heart opened elate with hope i seemed to listen to the voice of love but the awful words  it is thy prince clouded my spirit and when i turned to aciloe there was a dignity even in his tenderness that seemed for ever to tell me i was not his equal  yet thus to have interested my prince thus to be tended by his hand gave me a new existence i was now permitted to wander at will  it was the third of the ides that the feast in honor of the ghosts the feralia was held every one hastened to bring some little offering to the memory of their friends aciloe and i walked together to the obscure sepulcher of his father perseus who had then lately died he stood beside the grave he looked toward heaven he knelt and kissed the earth then clipping some of his silken tresses he deposited them on the cold tomb i could not help touching them  touch them not i pray thee he cried they are sacred to the dead the manes of our friends are not solicitous of what we present them it is sufficient if by us they are remembered nor avarice nor vanity are beyond the styx i stood near him  and how is it said he that thou do not bring thine offering  alas i replied i never knew a parent i never had a friend and when i die no one will soothe my departed spirit even with the last gift we present the dead  thou errest replied aciloe for had i survived thee i should never have forgotten thou were my dearest friend how sweet were those wondrous words what if he is not my lover i thought is he not the semblance is he not my friend  but what is friendship when we ask for love it is like the fragrance of remote flowers that aintly touches the senses or like the beam of the chaste moon that gives light but yields not warmth still still i pined sometimes to embolden me to tell my love i thought that a passion for a servant had not made even heroes blush the superb achilles was enamoured of his beauteous briseis and the regal agamemnon preerred to clytemnestra the more tender chryseis how often has the pang of ungratified love made my brain frantic then would i hasten to aciloe resolved to tell my love and willing to die but while my bosom rose and panted in his absence when i approached him it sunk with timidity it was chilled with awe i shivered i wept i was silent  it was now the ambrosial season of the floralia the festal day of flora all invites us then to perfume ourselves with essences to twine our temples with branches of myrtle and to wander gathering the years virgin flowers the more cherished children of her first birth the circensian shows were now proclaimed that day some hastened to the naumachia to gaze on naval combats some to the pentathlum to view the athletae or wrestlers some to the chariot races and some to the pyrrhic dances rome was happy our house was a solitude the very streets were silent aciloe and myself remained together  that day i had studiously adorned myself my drapery flowed loose my arms and my knees did not conceal themselves and my tresses were arranged with a nicer art than became a slave it was perhaps in honor of the goddess and yet i thought of aciloe as i corrected my dress before my mirror we sat beneath an almondtree whose silvery flowers dropped their odor we were supping and aciloe took off his sandals to recline on his couch  this evening said he the world will at least forget us and let us forget the world thou have done well to braid along thy streaming tresses those sweet violets and that tender lilac  i sighed for i thought to myself that i was but a victim crowned with flowers my bosom palpitated so warmly that i turned aside in disorder but perhaps my eyes expressed what my tongue refused i stole a side glance at aciloe and i joyed to behold an eye sparkling with the tenderest fire  he addressed me by name  leucothoe will thou never confide the secret of thy modest soul thou know the gods have not given to aciloe the marble heart of a tyrant but the waxen heart of a slave leucothoe thou take no food thou speak not nay turn not away that sweet confusion on thy cheek is my attachment then nothing mysterious girl live if thou would have aciloe live and smile if thou would have him happy  in leaning across the table his lips almost touched my face his tones so tender and so tremulous deliciously whispered in my ear and his warm breath past over my cheek i trembled with unknown sensations my respiration was suspended a faintness crept over my limbs a dimness fuffused my eyes a low tremulous noise wandered in my ears i felt that i must die or must speak  i complained of the odours of the almond tree but i could not finish the feigned murmur i sought to rise but my limbs were without motion  i turned to aciloe my voice died on my quivering lips a gush of delicious tears restored me  aciloe and would thou know my secret misery it is love consumes me ambitious love that lives on hopeless and cannot die  when i finished these hurried words i hid my face in my bosom aciloe heard aciloe understood his lips breathed on my lips and my trembling bosom rose to meet his bosom celestial felicity o love thou art even the happiness of the gods aciloe loved and never from that hour aciloe forsook me yes my prince was the slave of his slave delicious memory of love it charms even my old age and gives to my hoary and snowy head what is dearer than the roses of spring  the remembrance of golden hours  the end of love and humility the lovers or the birth of the pleasing arts advertisement to illustrate the nature of human inventions the following little romance has been composed the word invention originating in the latin inventus explains itself  a finding out invention is neither inspiration nor creation as some i believe still imagine it to be it is nothing but a sudden observation or a patient meditation and there can exist but two kinds of invention the one accidental struck out from a rapid observation and the other arising from combination the fruit of long and ingenious meditation man creates nothing he can only imitate or combine what he finds out in nature he can imagine no form he can produce no notion of which the model is not in nature  from accidental inventions man has derived great utility but never has claimed any glory but the invention of those arts or those discoveries in which he has wrestled with nature has agreeably flattered his pride it will amuse an ingenious mind to class under these two forms some traditional origins  in the first and inferior kind of inventions may be ranked the following  a tartarian hunter wanting some wadding observes a stone covered with some flakes resembling loose threads but when he fires his piece he observes that the gunpowder had no effect on the wadding he returns to his village consults his curate and halfterrified conceives he has about him some bewitched stuff they throw it into a large fire it does not burn and they take it out entire such was the accidental origin of the asbestos called the incombustible linen of the same class is that of glass some merchants in the sandy deserts rest their cauldrons on blocks of nitre and kindle a fire the nitre dissolving in the flame and mixing with the sand produces a transparent friable substance which is glass in the city of tire a dog seizing on the fish conchilis or purpura his lips were observed to be tinged with that glowing rosy red and it received its name from the town and the fish for it was called the tyrian purple children playing in the shop of a spectaclemaker with unequal and concave glasses arrange them in such a manner that the church steeple appeared to have removed itself near to them their loud acclamations excite the curiosity of their father the man of science looks through the glasses the hands of children had arranged and he discovers  the telescope accident alike discovered gunpowder printing and the quinquina the latter perhaps more salutary than either of the former such has been the origin of many useful inventions but in which the inventor could lay no claim to ingenuity  the second class ennobles man his dilated soul traverses through earth and heaven and he almost aspires to the energy of a sublime creator the ancients have recorded that the exquisite combinations of music derived their origin from a philosopher who stood listening to the strokes of a hammer on an anvil it was by meditating on the knolls of old oak trees and the pavements of london that that sublime edifice the edystone was raised in the tumultuous breast of the sea by its great artist the fact is recorded with great simplicity by himself and these knolls and these pavements from whence he first stole the hints are engraven in his singular work one evening in the cathedral of pisa galileo observed the vibrations of a brass luster pendent from the vaulted roof that had been left swinging by one of the vergers the pensive eye of genius meditated and its soul struggled with vast ideas hence he conceived the notion of measuring time by the medium of a pendulum and thus invented the clements of motion and mechanics the origin of gravitation is perhaps more sublime since the accident was more trivial the charming art of engraving owes one of its branches to the meditation of a studious prince rupert perceiving a soldier scraping and cleansing his fusil on which the nightdews had fallen and had rusted he combined its effects and from these conceived mezzotinto i will add two others which are extremely interesting jonas moore employed to survey the fens noticed that the sea made a curve line on the beach and from this circumstance be borrowed the hint to keep it effectually out of norfolk a french beadmaker observing that the water which had washed those small fish called bleaks was filled with luminous particles of a silvery bue and deposited a sediment possessing the luster of the most beautiful pearls formed from it the pearl essence which with melted isinglass is blown into thin glass globules and produces artificial pearls  reflecting on the origin of human inventions i combined many recorded traditions all of which wear a natural air of truth i imagined a little tale in which placing two primitive human beings in arcadia the mutual desire and the necessity of reciprocal pleasure would naturally give birth to the agreeable arts some difficulties arose in this little sketch but the completion of my design was of more consequence than an attempt to overcome one or two improbabilities the judicious reader will easily detect and forget them the indulgence of a reader is one requisite in this species of fictions  the lovers or the birth of the pleasing arts an arcadian romance part the first in a valley of arcadia amaryllis was a shepherdess on the rocks above lycidas was a goatherd their situation approached that of primaeval solitude never had they observed other human forms than their old fathers and mothers whom they visited at the full moon when their flocks were guarded by the silence of sleep  in the luxuriant valley amaryllis conducted her sheep while lycidas pursued his capricious goats on the rocky clifts amaryllis found her companions like herself timid and docile they rather followed her than she them often had she measured her height with the old ewes and discovered how she increased in stature  lycidas was vigorous as the goats he chaced he flew fearlessly along the points of clifts and stood on one foot at the edge of a precipice to snatch the wild goat hanging at the perilous extremity amaryllis frequently observed him above her with a tremulous delight and imitating his voice found that her tones could not like his fill the hollow hills ah there she thought is one like myself whose strong feet outleap a goat lycidas looked down sometimes on amaryllis and thought there is one like myself whose soft look is more tender than the eye of a lamb  one day the shepherdess at the brink of a river was bathing a lamb while lycidas leaning from a rock above watched the transparent waterdrops trickling on its snowy coat and hanging her fingers with pearls the lamb fell into the river amaryllis shrieked behold lycidas in the stream he brings the breathless animal he dries its velvet skin he warms it in his breast its little sides palpitate once more  it is born again he exclaims presenting it to amaryllis  ah said the pastoral virgin looking her gratitude i thought till now that a goatherd cared not for the sorrows of a shepherdess  oh amaryllis replied lycidas i often think of thee  how singular is this oh lycidas i too often think of thee  when i view thee kissing a lamb i would give ten of my goats to be that lamb  lycidas thou shall have my kisses when thou will come from the mountains when thou would have me kiss thee  after this interview lycidas was continually descending from the rocks to receive the caresses of amaryllis but sweet kisses inspired sweet words it became necessary to unite the goats of lycidas with the sheep of amaryllis and the mountaineers gradually abated their wildness among the mild inmates of the valley yet though influenced by the local softness and losing their restless desire of climbing by continually treading on a level earth they still retained their untamed spirit and never mingling with the timorous ever preceded and conducted the feebler domestics  observe said amaryllis to lycidas how thy goats disdain the society of my sheep how is it oh lycidas that thou admittest me to thy arms as if i were thy equal  i have heard my father say replied the youth that man is an animal more noble than a goat that his face looks up toward the gods and yet this seems an error for my face only looks straight forwards were i to look up to the gods i should stumble  could thou ever understand enquired amaryllis what the goats think of man  oh yes assuredly they deem themselves superior they climb with their hollow foot on ridges narrow as thy slender finger i have viewed them sleep on the point of a precipice where my eye only could touch them i have waked them by my voice but they only raised their heads and shook their beards and again laid themselves to sleep i have watched at the foot of the rock in patient helplessness such is man  i have often thought replied amaryllis that man is a kind of goat for our fathers have beards but the faces of our mothers are smooth as mine and my sheep thou too wilt have a beard no doubt she passed her hand playfully over his chin already i perceive a fine brown shade glisten around thy face how soft i touch it but cannot feel it be sure all human beings are only a kind of goats and sheep thine eye seems to command nature thy strong step echoes on the earth but i timidly follow thee and all my glory is my submission  in conversations thus simple and innocent they sometimes interchanged their thoughts but they sported more than they talked at the margent of a lucid fountain or under an umbrage dropping roses they divided their milk and their fruits the velvet turf sprang under their flying feet the echo multiplied their silver voices mimicking a butting goat lycidas would run at amaryllis but amaryllis most loved to lie down like a sheep and in short pantings breathe on her beloved lycidas amaryllis would conceal herself behind a woodbine hedge or lie in the covering fern and then lycidas would call on her seek her through all her hiding spots and murmur at yet halfenjoy the feigned absence seldom could he track her through her inventive and mysterious paths till the playful maid betrayed herself by a loud laugh or attempted to fly while her inviting eyes accused the pursuers tardy embrace sometimes when he returned home she would lie down feigning to sleep while her eyes were half open to see if lycidas would immediately hasten to her the youth kneeled and sighed and kissed her eyes till she laughed  sometimes he would disorder her wavy tresses while she murmured with a smile and then would adorn them to his fancy studding them with roses or braiding them with jessamine but if he often loved to disorder her fine tresses he was careful in passing her favorite flowers to support their bended stalks and to weave more closely her favorite shades the tender reminiscence of her lovers attention often mingled with the delicious perfumes of the flower and the bowery verdure of the tree he would compose what he called serpents of flowers and fancifully wind them about her long tresses praying the gods that no other serpents might ever approach her  one evening beneath a lofty myrtletree the beauteous amaryllis was lamenting the death of a nightingale she said sweetest tears have fallen with the touching close of its delicious tones i felt the music creep along my nerves and the fine vibrations play through my heart i weep now lycidas when i think such a charming sadness may never again give delightful tears  ah that i could recall thy nightingale into existence as i did thy drowned lamb exclaimed the amiable youth  thou never can dear companion it breathed a long and dying fall like the gentle airs moving the tops of the hollow reeds making a moaning melody  studious to charm his beloved with the voice of the nightingale the thoughts of lycidas produced a sleepless night the next day he gave amaryllis the care of his goats and promised an early return the sun declined and lycidas returned not amaryllis sighed at its farewell beam she sat her head reclining on her arm suddenly aerial notes floated in soft remote sounds the startled amaryllis exclaimed  the air sings in the clouds the notes seemed approaching to her she looked up at the myrtletree they warbled more musically clear she perceived lycidas he held something in his hands to his lips  have thou found another nightingale lycidas replied but by the accents of his harmonious mouth what miracle is this can thou give a vocal soul to a hollow reed  yes replied lycidas it was thou who did instruct me thou did resemble the voice of the nightingale to the light airs breathing on the hollow reeds all day i wandered for a nightingale and i found none i took a reed and made little entrances for my breath i said oh gentle reed i can give thee air if thou can yield me the voice of the nightingale i breathed and it was music  this first of flutes was their most valued acquisition for it bestowed a new pleasure and in the solitude of lovers pleasure is their only avarice lycidas gradually modulating his reed by his ear perceived the successive sounds of melody and at length the concords of harmony but often weary with trying musical sounds the eyes of amaryllis fired his soul and the rapt enthusiast tender or gay at such moments made his lively inflections and variety of accent imitate their sensations and echo their passions such is imitative music which says rousseau expresses all passions paints all pictures represents all objects and subjects all nature herself to its skilful imitations and thus conveys to the heart of man those sentiments proper to touch and to agitate  such was the progress of instrumental music  as they wept or laughed they marvelled how the air through a hollow reed could speak more persuasively to their hearts than their own voices they knew not that the imitations of art please more than nature herself when lycidas played amaryllis could not sit still and her gestures corresponded with the passions he inspired was amaryllis capricious lycidas breathed a long dissolving strain sounds associated in her mind with ideas of tenderness her ear arrested her steps and silenced her tongue while the sweetness of her physiognomy melted in the dew of her eye and expressed itself in many a passionate attitude was amaryllis plunged in the softest melancholy aerial tones rapid and voluble vibrated around till stealing the sense of thought from the pensive beauty they broke into gay melodies while responsive to their cheerful influence her light footsteps gave what lycidas termed the music to the eye and such was the origin of theatric dance  their enjoyments were only interrupted by his frequent absences whole days were sometimes passed in search of a wanton goat how terrible is the absence of him in whose presence alone the heart feels the sense of existence she thought this one night in a cave where lycidas was sleeping while the wakeful beauty hung enamoured over each interesting feature a suspended lamp was placed near  ah she continued even this pleasing light this soft moon of my chamber is the thought of his genius it is a pleasing idea of apuleius in his cupid and psyche that the lamp was first invented by a lover that he might for a longer time enjoy by night the object of his desire  it was from the pendent light of the glowworm in the illumined hedge that he stole the hint it is thus that borrowing every happy conception from nature he discovers around him the sources of enjoyment  the lamp threw its light on the even wall and the solitary flame strongly reflected the shadow of his face  ye gods exclaimed the fond maid behold two lycidases ye speaking features can ye not for ever dwell on that wall then would lycidas not entirely quit me in his absence how consoling even the shadow of what we love lycidas thy shade would to me prove a tender companion fugitive and cherished shadow live here when lycidas roves in the circling mountains  she took up her sheephook and affectionately tracing the shadow of her lover its sharp iron graved it on the wall lycidas turned and the lines remained unmoved  he is for ever there exclaimed the enraptured amaryllis lycidas awoke  who is here amaryllis  thyself thyself she cried in embracing him these eyes shall worship thee when thou art on the clifts whole suns from me the light shall give me thy presence in the mimic wonder behold thy halfclosed eye thy halfopened lips for ever smiling on that wall lycidas looked on the wall and on amaryllis and they embraced such was the origin of design it is singular that the origin of painting has ever been attributed to the oftenrepeated story of the corinthian maid sketching the shadow of her sleeping lover but this is only the origin of design and in fact is but a silhouette i have never been able to trace the origin of coloring to any recorded tradition   amaryllis in the absence of lycidas passed many hours in contemplating this first portrait of love but the familiarity of enjoyment discovered its imperfections  dismal shadow she cried thou please me because thou resemblest lycidas but lycidas would not charm me did he resemble thee where is the soft mutability of his cheek melancholy resemblance of a form of gaiety only when lycidas is dead will he resemble thee  she held in her lap a treasury of flowers which she was assorting to weave into a wreath for lycidas she took a rose and continued  this breathing rose is the hue of his cheek o shade i will place it on thy cheek this white lily is like the snow of his forehead that its splendid whiteness could for ever spread on thine these blue violets are the purple of his veins and she delicately laid them along the neck and this dark eye of the tulip is black as his brilliant eye and she fixed it there  entranced she gazed on the illusive shadow for a moment it was her lycidas his beautiful colors lived to her eye such was the first essay of coloring the tinted impressions which some of the flowers left behind gave them afterward a hint to express from various plants and minerals that variety of colors which gave birth to the more perfect parts of painting after this was written the notion was verified by two facts i discovered the one in the life of carlo maratti who when a child for want of colors made use of the juices of herbs and flowers the other in the history of the canary islands where the author writes that some of the majorcans were good artificers they built houses and painted them elegantly with the colors which they extracted from certain herbs and flowers upon the island the majorcans were then in the infancy of society     seated in the sultry silence of summer at the entrance of a grove they viewed their slocks retired beneath the umbrageous hedges  dear lycidas said the smiling maid how amiable the dewy mornings and the clear moons of summer i love at noontide to lay myself beside some rippling water and listen to its cooling murmurs mingling with the airy murmurs of a be often as they blend they lull my spirits with one rocking sound and i catch some halfdream it is in winter i feel unhappy the cave our fathers hewed is so round or so square one sees the termination of every thing nothing is left to the imagination it is not thus in nature she never imprisons the eye all her lines are waved and varied and enchanted how often i sigh when i view nothing of lise and motion before me but the solitary flame trembling on the opposite wall  lycidas replied  had i been idle last winter as thou were i too should have been melancholy in the cave then i made reeds for summer songs i added another aperture to my flutes and i produced a new music how many have thou broken in thy first lessons do not mind them amaryllis i am pleased when thou breakest them for to me it is delightful to amend thy reeds and to pass my fingers over the places thine have touched  she kissed lycidas and said  oh that our days may be blended as the air we played this morning two symphonious instruments yielding but one modulation the other evening waiting thy return beside the rivulet i thought it were happiness for us to resemble it when it receives a new stream the two streams can never be separated they touch and are for ever united  and i wish continued amaryllis that we could live in such a grove through the happy circle of the year  thou do nothing but wish said lycidas  had i such a grove in winter the aspect of nature would console me in thy absence observe how finely arched is the grove above us by the interwoven boughs as if placed in a regular order view the straight trunks of the palm trees mark the little openings around delighting the eye with various views and here as we sit this seems the only entrance of the grove on the hollow curves of these trees my foot has rested when i climbed till i was seated at their summit one day i ascended and descried thee on the great rock directing thy goats i saw thee urging the vagrants home and often kissing thy hand as thou did stretch it toward our valley approaching thou did sound thy reed then my heart bounded with the tender thought that thou did remember me when thou thoughtest that i could not see thee  while the voluble beauty was describing the grove the eye of lycidas had intensely followed the objects of her fancy and now he was lost in reverie the bunch of grapes he held in his hand remained unplucked when she ceased he spoke not he wandered from thought to thought he sat in motionless abstraction  art thou disordered my sweet lycidas not one smile dimples thy cheek the heaviness of sleep presses thy lids ah thou look on the earth and not on amaryllis  lycidas starting from his trance flung the grapes from his hand in rapture the creative smile of enthusiasm lighted up every feature his eye swam in a liquid fire a tremor of sensibility vibrated through his frame looking on amaryllis with complacency he said  i was only thinking  and why do thou think dear lycidas to think is to toil with thee i never think i only feel it is in thine absence i think and suffer in the enjoyment of thy presence when i lay my hand on thy beating heart when i seal my trembling lips on thy soft lips when i blend my breath with thy breath it is then i am all sensation ah then should a single thought intervene i should feel it an interruption of my existence  lycidas replied smiling  do thou not perceive that thou thyself art thinking while thou prattlest against the labor of thought  to think with thee lycidas seems no pain my thoughts embrace thy thoughts as my arms wind around thy arms in thine absence only thinking tortures for since i have known thee i abhor all that is solitary  after this conversation lycidas was constantly absent from amaryllis he had ever some prompt excuse a goat was missing she counted the herd and the number was just he fell down the rock and was lamed she examined his foot and it was unmarked by a bruise he was in pursuit of a nightingale but he never brought one home he had listened hours near a bed of reeds that his ear might discover a new music but he still could only play on one kind of reed the autumn was closing and his excuses of absence became every day more unsatisfactory  amaryllis sat deserted and her whole soul dreamed of lycidas her melancholy diffused itself over every surrounding object how nature has suddenly changed exclaimed the solitary virgin she murmured with the murmurs of the rivulet she sighed with the evening zephyr she flew to the portrait and on the face of the shadowy lycidas rolled living tears  the evening return of lycidas came unmarked by fondness pensive weary and silent a cold caress a rapid meal and a deep slumber it was now that first she perceived how in the presence of unsocial man one may find a terrible solitude  sometimes she thought of tracking his concealed retreat yet it was long ere she could persuade herself to abandon for one day the flock and the herd once she followed him in agony she pressed his rapid footsteps on the morning dews she came to a high rock from whence lycidas precipitated himself with ease to another and disappeared she returned to the valley to think and to mourn  at length the habitual reverie of melancholy thought and desponding curiosity presented a monstrous imagination to her disordered senses the terrific chimaera that breeds in the delirium of love she struck her lovely forehead the pulses of her temples rose burning to her touch her soul sickened her frame shivered she felt the pang of jealousy  she thinks lycidas may have discovered another amaryllis he flies to kiss other cheeks there are doubtless beings like ourselves on this earth other valleys other rocks and other shepherdesses ah if every valley should have its amaryllis then is lycidas for ever lost to me for all will adore lycidas though lycidas may adore none ah ingrate capricious as thy goats were there as many lycidases thou would be to me the only lycidas for i feel i have but one heart and one heart can love but once  every evening lycidas found his amaryllis in tears he said why do thou weep  lycidas can thou ask why i weep when thou shakest the flower do thou inquire why the trembling dews are scattered  lovelier than the flowers at thy seat in the grove has thy lycidas ever rudely touched thy softness  lycidas those flowers thy hands reared are faded once in gazing on them methought they had a voice i heard or seemed to hear thou were then kissing another amaryllis i turned in horror from those flowers how one can cherish and abhor the same object  another amaryllis exclaimed lycidas is there another on this earth i have seen the same plants and the same animals reproduce themselves but never have i seen an infant amaryllis i consider thee as a solitary beauty in nature there is but one sun one moon and one amaryllis  enamouring embraces gave to the virgins soul a new sensation of felicity that which in one day restores the lost happiness of years  chun sol giorno puo ristorar molt anni  petrarcha  drops of tears rolled on the fine carnation of her cheek  still thou weepest cried lycidas kissing them one by one  lycidas these are not like the tears i wept  are there then two kinds of tears  what know i but this oh lycidas that i could wish for ever to feel the strange delight of these sweet tears  when lycidas awoke the succeeding morning he quitted not amaryllis as of late an unanxious sleep restored the serenity of pleasure his soul moved in the calm of the passions his eye and his hand alike caressed and his voice had the melody of rapture for he anticipated a new enjoyment  he spoke  feel thou not the hoary morning with its frosty breath soon will it come with a naked head spread with ungenial snow the old year creeps on with the imperfect day is not the old year like our old fathers thou must quit thy grove  alas if thou forsakest me this winter the cave will be my sepulcher thou must bury me in it as we buried the father of my father  amaryllis thou shall no more live in a cave thou shall reside in a grove but it is a grove without leaves it was for this i quitted thee incessantly i toiled till my limbs could scarcely conduct me home i thought till even in thy presence my thoughts felt weary  a smile played on the pensive features of amaryllis an indistinct idea rushed across her mind  say what novel miracle has lycidas invented  come with me cried the youth rising with rapture  i cannot said amaryllis i once followed thee till i reached the great rock from whence thou flewest like the eagle that builds its aerie there  for thee a smoother passage is formed thou shall walk over the waters  what say thou can the foot repeat its steps on aught but the solid earth  lycidas returned to his seat and said  i must first inform thee of another discovery one day returning to the grove without leaves i found the rock had disparted i sought to enter by the lower part the broad stream opposed i swam across but thou can not swim  alas exclaimed amaryllis  i sat dejected on the banks as my eye reached the grove without leaves i sighed a longtailed bird now flew across the stream it floated in air by the undulations of its tail till then i had never observed the manner of its flight but we find every thing when we are deeply interested in its discovery and nature   proceed proceed cried the impatient amaryllis thou art too fond of reflections  i then perceived a large fish i observed the sharp fins cutting the wave its head steadily firm its tail moving gently from side to side suddenly i cried out i will make a fish i took planks i hollowed the trunk of a tree to bear us within as if we were the entrails of the fish i constructed the head the prow  and the tail a stern with a moveable helm  and i made two fins the oars  but then i found i could not direct the motion against the winds yet the bird steered against the winds i placed two pieces of my vest erect in the fish of wood and these were the wings the sails  and now amaryllis we can swim like a fish and fly like a bird the river wanders but for thee and thou shall walk on the surface of the waters sailing  in this invention of a sailing vessel i have blended the various traditions this was indeed one of my purposes yet however the account be faithful to truth it is certainly not the more valuable to the imagination the objects are less grateful than if they were formed by some happy fiction after this trifle was composed a friend pointed out to me a fine poem of gesners that of the first navigator that delicate writer there represents a lover meditating on the banks of a river desirous of crossing it to obtain a sight of his mistress he views floating on the stream a vast trunk of an old tree hollowed by age a timid rabbit escaped from the hunter wrapped in some green branches lies in it the winds blow it to the shore near the young lover this accident first teaches him to trust himself in a hollow wood no fiction can be more elegant he says an animal first taught me to swim in the trunk of a tree from animals i will learn the means to perfect this new invention i will make wooden feet wide as those of the swan and fix them at the side of the hollow trunk these form the oars the poet has called in the god of love and a nereid and the sovereign of the winds i have not however found it necessary to ask the aid of a divinity the mythology of poetry is perhaps too liberally employed by that amiable poet who while he really consulted nature often turned away from nature to art as may be observed in his own designs where the landscape taken from the localities of his native country is enchantingly picturesque with every charm of genius while in the same landscape his ancient figures copied from gems statues and other antique remains have an incongruous effect   end of part the first part the second lycidas now conducted amaryllis to the banks of the river she raised her hands in wonder at the view of the wooden fish tremblingly she entered lycidas unfurled the sail he pushed off the little bark and now they glide on the stream  be it thine dear partner of my inventions said the first navigator to conduct the tail of the fish  how proudly it elevates its head i will give motion to the fins in mute astonishment amaryllis turned the helm she looked around and then exclaimed  lycidas lo the mountains and the valleys move the earth itself wondering at thy happy audacity rises to pursue us fugitives from our native soil  thou ever yieldest to thy fancy amaryllis the earth moves not but we move  ah lycidas if in returning to our cherished home i find all departed from us where shall i look for our sheep and our goats if the mountains can leap into the river art thou certain the earth moves not surely what mimics motion so well has motion  like thee i thought amaryllis when i first quitted the shore like thee astonished i beheld the mountains tremble and the valleys glide my heart coiled within me impatiently i gained the shore i grasped it in eager joy i kissed it i wept over it cherished earth i cried on which my amaryllis treads never shall my feet again wander but soon i found it had never moved  amaryllis now watching the motion of the oars was again rapt in wonder the light waterdrops falling from the raised oars excited her first attention she desired to examine them  i thought she said thy fins had white feathers they glittered like the loose plumage of the dove scattered by the winds  how thou fanciest all thou viewest they are but the shining drops of water falling in the sunbeam and glittering as they fall among skilful rowers the art of flinging the water from their oars in long and light trails is termed feathering the oar from the appearance it bears with falling feathers   and now she wondered at the oars in the water leaning on one side the little bark overset and the two first navigators fell into the stream lycidas with one arm embraces the fainting amaryllis and with the other steers along the waves he sustains her drooping head and toiling in the river exhausted gains the opposite bank the touch of the solid earth restores him he stretches the recovering beauty on the velvet turf he awakens life by the warmth of his kisses and when her relumed eyes open the first object they rested on were the eyes of lycidas his tender embraces quell her fugitive terrors the boat floated slowly toward them  see amaryllis the wooden fish follows us it was thy error in trusting all thy weight on one side did i not tell thee we were as the entrails of the fish i viewed thy deep attention thou did look so beautiful with the fullness and softness of thine eyes that in gazing on thee i forgot the danger  lycidas well might i gaze i viewed another wonder in the stream the two fins which thou did lift in the air were straight but moving in the water they were bent and doubled  thou errest amaryllis behold them  he plunged them into the stream and the oar straight in the air was bent in the water he drew them out and examined them then looked on the oars and then on amaryllis her eye was full of fearful wonder  these are things said lycidas recovering from his alarm which the gods only understand  amaryllis by the tender solicitude of lycidas had received no other ill than the alarm of the sudden plunge into the stream he wrung the water from her fine tresses he kissed the drops hanging on her lids and shook the wet from their dress the sun darted along an azure heaven they gave no thought to the past but proceeded pursuing each other in sport  they reached a deep and luxuriant valley embosomed among the circling hills it seemed even in arcadia as if nature had sought to conceal the spot she fondly embellished in the center another miracle arrested the rapid steps of amaryllis she felt the same sensation the polished european even now feels at the view of a pyramid it was indeed but a rude edifice the first house the origin of architecture  they entered amaryllis walked around ascended returned and reascended she spoke only with the interjections of surprise and admiration lycidas explained the scene  what thou viewest amaryllis is for thy winter residence the cavern confined the fancy of thine eye i therefore raised this abode on the bosom of the earth itself that thus thou may question nature from hour to hour and face to face thy conversation in the grove inspired the invention this abode is but a grove despoiled of its foliage behold the straight trunks of the palm trees the pillars  view the vaulted arch the grove formed with its intermingled boughs the roof or ceiling  i have hewed the resting places thy foot found on the trunks of trees and the apertures around which solaced thine eye the stairs and windows  thou did observe the grove had but one proper entrance behold it thou can find no admittance but between these open piles the door  and all this i call a grove without leaves a house  it requires no testimonies to prove that the first models of architecture were natural objects trees rocks and other things which afforded animals a refuge formed our first attempts of imitation mr price in his essay on the picturesque with great probability says that  rocks of crumbling friable stone broken into detached pointed forms with openings and intricacies of every kind may be compared to similar openings and intricacies in gothic buildings of which indeed they probably gave the first idea vol ii p      it has been observed that gothic architecture is taken from a walk of trees whose branching heads are curiously imitated by the roof and we shall also find that the grecian orders form a more interesting imitation as we proceed in this romance  it is curious to observe if i may so express myself that nature is still so natural to us that even in this most luxurious age with all its pomp and all its refinements we still have had recourse to nature in our most splendid edifices a remarkable instance is that of a theater at paris constructed to represent a bower of trees and the interlacing of the branches form the ceiling mr jackson has noticed this building it was imitated by astley in his summer theater mr de saint pierre observes that the column is less pleasing than the palm tree after which it was imitated     this is but the first rude pile my hands have reared like the first shade thou did trace of my features when thou did discover the coloring thou were sensible of the imperfection i foretell new improvements sublime ideas inflame my soul and this imitation of nature shall still be enriched by ornaments which shall endear this rude edifice and make it the house of the heart  that day they delightfully wandered in this first house returning to the boat amaryllis promised to give no other motion to the fish of wood than the quiet action of the tail or rudder while she grasped it in her slender hand she kept her eyes on the fullorbed moon and sometimes stole a trembling glance on lycidas smiling he said amaryllis thou may move thine eyes and if thou smilest on me the oars will play more freely  may i move my eyes lycidas ah how sweetly is thy face silvered over by the moon how its beams break along the glittering waves when the surface of the waters is but lightly touched the moon looks as if it were swimming through the river when unruffled its silvery body seems to sleep along its liquid bed how musically soft the sound of thy cadenced oars dropping in the stream how wondrous and how sweet is all oh lycidas till now i never found a path in the stream surely the silence on the waters is more awful than the silence on the earth  returned to their valley they found they had been missed the bleating sheep from all parts uttered their small voices of complaint it was the first day their tender pastoress had deserted to want her affection was to them to suffer a revolution in nature some had straggled to the borders of the valley and trembled in the foreign path some lie panting and extenuate while some sat alone desolated knowing not where to go since now there was no one to follow not thus with the goats they fiercely butted at each other now ran in circles now wildly wandered up their native rocks every where the spirit of revolt prevailed exulting in a dangerous liberty  that night and the succeeding day lycidas consumed in the chase of his rebels and amaryllis in a thousand tender offices to her softhearted family this was the first trouble their happy occupations had known and they reflected  in seeking for new arts dear lycidas we neglect those of daily use  ah replied the inventive goatherd with the ardency of genius i wish i had not the care of goats soft indolence thou nurse of thought thou should be my choice stretched in some waving shade or by some genial blaze i would meditate on nature i would arrange the thousand pictures she has painted on my brain till from them i stole a thousand hints to form a thousand arts  my dear lycidas much i fear that thy thinking will to thee prove a source of great trouble the fever of curiosity scorches thy heart and thy cheeks lose their vermil fullness i remember when i pressed my finger on thy cheek how it sunk in the firm flesh no more thou do taste our simple happiness no more thou sportest on the fern heath often thou stealest to solitude and often my kiss awakens thee from a daydream  they were now desirous of residing in the house amaryllis in quitting the cavern lamented that she left behind her favorite objects the portrait of lycidas and some beautiful plants which grew at the entrance of the grove  care not for my shadow cried lycidas to the sorrowing maid thou can trace another on the wall of the house thou know my shadow always accompanies me  true but here thou smilest so enchantingly every feature so felicitously plays in thy intendering physiognomy surely when i drew thee thus asleep thou were dreaming one of the dreams of genius the invention of a new art seems painted on thy face  in vain lycidas assured her his features would remain the same in all places to convince her he laid himself down beside the wall but essayed in vain to express the same physiognomy amaryllis still mourned to leave the shadow of her lover  this portrait of lycidas by having been incessantly traced by the sharp hook of the passionate shepherdess had gradually become an alto relievo it stood prominent on the wall at that moment lycidas was employed in forming clay to fill up cavities in the boat half vexed that amaryllis consumed the hour in idle regrets he violently struck the ductile earth in sportive anger against the protuberant image behold another miracle the argillaceous matter received the full impression and faithfully preserved the physiognomy and the atlitude  thou have it now exclaimed lycidas now will my shadow wander with thee wherever thou rovest and this was the first effort of sculpture  behold another art cried amaryllis now i feel but one regret  to abandon the cherished plants that live where the grove opens  beautiful inspirer of my inventions in vain my talent toils to reach thy fancy thou meritest that i should bid the flowers start into birth beneath thy foot coloring thy steps but man cannot create he can only imitate  the first house was the source of their winters happiness it formed the incessant object of lycidass meditation it absorbed his faculties it was the passion of his imagination every day some new want prompted the invention of some new tool and at length he discovered marble gradual embellishments became visible and the new ornaments which had been insensibly formed one day struck with their united graces the thoughtful eye of amaryllis it had ceased to be the same house it might have been called a palace  lycidas said amaryllis i have marked thy constant occupations and i would not disturb thy happy labors by my complaints the invention of new arts costs me the loss of many kisses but my soul nourishing a spark of thy divine flame knows how to suffer thy absence even when thou art present what a scene of enchantment has arisen pillars of wood are changed to columns of marble the foot that sunk in the damp turf now glides on the smooth pavement here elegant beauty rises in a slender form there a massy grandeur reposes looking its immovability a certain disposition arranging all repeating on one side what charms on the other yet blending all the parts into one an uniform variety but how shall i name that secret something diffused through the whole the soul animating this edifice like the light which itself imperceivable makes all things perceived when our language yields not the fullness of expression we call one thing by another and this something diffused throughout this edifice is like music a silent music it is harmonious to the eye my sensations obscure themselves in language tell me what is this thou have raised with the mysterious magic of thy hand  it is a new art replied lycidas the forms thou viewest around i found in nature i discovered them in our own forms and this art is a memorial of human affection  explain thyself said amaryllis with fondness and curiosity  observe that column opposite  it is delicacy and lightness  it is thyself  lycidas smiled while the wondering amaryllis leant over him contemplating the column with the tremor of delight  yes it is thyself raised to thy memory i gave it the delicacy of the feminine character i refer the curious reader to vitruvius for a great number of such traditions i have omitted several of a pleasing nature as not entering into my plan when the ionians raised a temple to diana they sought for a novel grace to adorn the columns and as the doric had been formed on the model of a man they gave the ionic the delicacy of a females body by making it more slender and by the imitations noticed in the romance the ionic is a medium between the massive and the delicate orders between simplicity and richness it is properly used in churches and religious houses and in courts of justice and other places of tranquillity and devotion  see newtons splendid edition of vitruvius  it has all thy gracility it is a model of a woman with her ornaments the volutes at its head twining in spiral lines represent thy locks curling beneath thine ear the deep indented flutings that run down the trunk imitate the folds of thy flowing dress the base which winds like twisted cords resembles thy sandals that eloquent enthusiast the picturesque saint pierre writes  if we attentively observe we shall see that the forms which most delight us in art as those of antique vases and the proportions of the height and breadth in monuments have been all drawn from the human form it is known that the ionic column with its capital and its flutings was imitated from the headdress and the robe of the grecian females  i refer the reader to the plate prefixed to this volume which i designed as illustrative of all these traditions     but the columns opposite are richer than mine what means that beautiful ornament which looks like a rich foliage branching from the top such is the wellknown origin of the corinthian order the circumstance is elegantly described by vitruvius   it is designed for what it seems one day near the cave thou did leave a panicr on a young acanthus the panier was covered by a tile and the rich foliage of the plant grew around it and we admired how thy basket covered by a tile had as it were become a part of the acanthus itself forming a new and beautiful object examine it it is but a copy  wonderful lycidas but thyself where art thou  there replied the first architect pointing to a pillar of the doric order which is formed with the proportions and strength of the body of a man a naked simplicity rather than a finished elegance the doric was made seven times as high as thick and copied the proportions and the beauty of a robust man its solidity is employed by the moderns in large and strong buildings in the gates of cities the exterior of churches and wherever delicacy of ornament would be unsuitable  mark that plain unadorned column it was the first i raised the tuscan the most massive and the plainest as it was the first of the orders vitruvius calls it the rustic order and it ought only to be employed in country houses or marketplaces and the lower offices of palaces thomson did not forget these traditional origins of the orders in architecture the poet evidently alludes to them in the following happy lines of a poem so insensibly calumniated by the thoughtless or the tasteless criticism of johnson  first unadorned and nobly plain the manly doric rose the ionic then with decent matron grace her airy pillar heaved luxuriant last the rich corinthian spread her wanton wreath liberty part ii v     it has a rude and primitive simplicity for one never knows how to ornament a first production the origin of the first column was the trunk of a tree my great difficulty at first was to know how high i should make it the height of the tree was too great so i proportioned it to my own height those long arcades were imagined from a row of trees and this dome above us but imitates the vault of heaven  divine artist thou have not explained that secret something that silent music which so touches and so satisfies the soul  what thou fancifully call a silent music is the effect of a symmetrical proportion in art no inharmonious object is agreeable all must be balanced the height must be proportioned to the breadth the relative parts of a work are measured by the whole and the whole must be consonant to the parts such amaryllis are the concords even in marble  this i learnt from nature for it is exhibited in the human form there we trace an affinity between the soot the hand the finger and all its parts in every perfect work each individual member should enable us to judge of the magnitude of the work itself it is thy tapering arms winding like tendrils round my neck thy two souldissolving eyes and the regular graces of thy wellproportioned form that enchant from nature and from thee i learnt the gradual charm of unity in proportion and uniformity in variety  such was the origin of the orders of architecture  it was now spring the earth was mantled by a verdure that vested her rather with beauty than with warmth the echo seldom awakened in the cold season returned to delight the ear of amaryllis  lycidas had united to the modulation of instrumental the charm of vocal music but hitherto they were spontaneous and casual expressions of passion without measure or design and like the origin of human language little more than natural ejaculations of the heart of late they had taken a new form something they had of art and they became poetry he perceived that amaryllis felt an ecstasy of pleasure when in the snowy season reclined by the social blaze he brought to her recollection the scenery of summer the ideas of the sun the shades and the waters delighted her in the winter it was the cherished picture of nature in her absence and she felt the same pleasure in the vivid description as when she contemplated the portrait of lycidas on their separation she called these descriptions painting in thought lycidas gradually discovered that his chaunt was susceptible of order and that it communicated a pleasurable sensation when it solicited the ear by certain pauses and cadences this produced meter or blankverse they were exquisitely gratified when they found the art of describing one object by another as amaryllis termed it and this opened an eternal source of metaphors and images yet to this rude though not unpleasing poetry was still wanting a peculiar charm that artifice which at once combines the pleasing returns of uniformity with the diversifications of variety  this appeared when amaryllis one day listening to the echo inquired of lycidas  what is this mysterious flight that my voice takes what is echo  it is said lycidas the mirror of the voice  then it is not she continued the voice itself the liquid glass that reflects our forms is not a part of our forms  be not overcurious amaryllis for thee it is sufficient to sport with the mimic sound i cannot invent an echo the gods preserve their own secrets  the playful echo ever dclights me said amaryllis but when i call on thee and thou hear me not then in cruel mockery when i say lycidas lycidas it only replies das das thou see the echo is irrational for it never answers but by the last syllable  ye gods exclaimed the enthusiastic lycidas thou love the repeating accent of the echo i can invent an echo i will close my verses with a reverberating sound every line was now answered by an echoing line such was the origin of rhyme an italian poet ingeniously conceived this idea  tu sai pur che limagin della voce che risponde da i sassi ov echo alberga fu inventrice delle prime rhyme lapi del rucellai   it was in the luxuriance of summer that amaryllis perceived her abode had still some wants this spot selected by lycidas for its amenity and the forest trees was not stored with rural luxuries lycidas passed many hours in returning to their ancient cavern for its neighboring fruits every day he toiled beneath a panier filled with the arcadian food but whenever he neglected to bring a copious lap of the freshest flowers amaryllis tenderly chided him and often with a sigh complained to lycidas that their trees were without fruit and their soil without flowers  she had lamented so frequently that he never brought sufficient roses and hyacinths that one day having found a rosetree whose roots had been loosened in the soil he easily extracted it and threw it at the feet of amaryllis she exclaimed  beauteous family of flowers ye will all perish at once for your violated and tender society severed from your natal spots pine in a foreign air while ye yield your soothing odours no maternal earth will supply you with new sources of existence every breath of air ye fill with sweetness and in every breath ye are dying prodigal of your cherished existence a tender regret disturbs us in the moment of pleasure lycidas i will bury them in the sod that covers the lamb we buried last week  she made a cavity in the earth in which she deposited the rosetree the transplanted roses struck their roots in the soil the bush flourished to their wondering eye and graced their habitation with its solitary beauty another discovery more roses and more hyacinths every pleasing plant they met in their walks became domiciliated they passed hours in herbalising and in the succeeding summer the forest air was sweetened with new odours and a flowergarden embellished their solitude transplantation so natural an idea in an age of culture appears not to occur to the minds of those who have made little progress in the agricultural art the following anecdote seems to confirm this observation  niebuhr tells us in his travels through arabia that mr forskal often visited the kiaja and persuaded him to form a garden for plants near his house and to bring from the interior parts of the country the shrub which produces the balm of mecca the arabs looked upon this as a very happy thought and the more so because the balm is not to be obtained pure at jidda vol i p         but to have thus accidentally discovered the arts of planting and transplanting was not sufficient for the propagation of their trees their horticulture was still imperfect they perceived with equal disappointment and surprise that the vines most luxuriant in leaves were barren while others of thinner foliage were prodigal of fruit amaryllis wondered and lycidas reflected he observed that the vine yielding the most abundant fruit was one which a favorite goat was allowed to browze he observed he meditated he stole the hint he lopped the branches of the vines and it was the goat who first showed to man the art of pruning  the procuring of wild honey from the cavities of old trees and the clefts of rocks was often an uncertain pursuit and an insufficient resource another inquietude another want another invention  they watched a little populace of soraging bees busy on their ambrosial repast spoiling the farina of flowers or pressing the tops of the stamina and thus anticipating the cautious economy of nature the amusing sound when they plunge their little velvet heads in the calix of a flower and pierce through the resisting petal while the sudden silence expresses the ardent pillage did they track the vagrants to their waxen tower there a new idea of society gave a sublime emotion to our two solitaries they traced order in a multitude they viewed a city and its inhabitants and with a delicious joy amaryllis discovered the queenbee she exclaimed in contemplating their symmetrical solid and convenient cells those finely planned edifices for thousands of the living  lycidas thou must acknowledge the architecture of the little bees is more wonderful than thine  it is more perfect replied lycidas for these fabrics are just adapted to their inmates while in our palace there are a hundred things to add and to amend  they instructed themselves in the human passions of which they were strangers to many in meditating on this society innumerable offices of affection penetrated their hearts with the sensibility of humanity  lycidas having observed that the bees were ever settling on aromatic plants on the thyme the rosemary the sage and rested long on the flowers of the lime he planted on the southern steep of his valley numerous beds of balmy flowers and odoriferous herbs  want said lycidas and not caprice urges their restless flight they are not volatile but diligent i can afford the wanderers a resting spot perhaps they may make it a home and we will interchange our mutual industry  what he imagined succeeded the explorers of sweets soon discovered the new world the aromatic land inspired a thousand adventurers who constant to pleasure knew no other native spot than where pleasure was found the queen followed the colony they then built their cells and peopled with dark clusters the pendent boughs the voice of the be was musical beneath the solitary heaven of our lovers such was the origin of an apiary or be garden m saint pierre has given a hint how an aviary might have been formed it is in his delightful paul and virginia where paul brings to the spot most pleasing to virginia from the neighboring forests the nests of all kinds of birds the fathers and mothers of these birds followed their little ones and established themselves in this new colony   they had now much advanced in the art of painting but as they only employed their pencils from a spirit of gaiety and a passion for decoration the sublime inventions of the art were not yet conceived the ideal was unknown but the exactest imitation was practiced they knew well to copy the purple bloom of the fruit as it hung on the tree and the brilliant tint of the flower as it caught the sunbeam on its native stalk they had mutually attempted to paint their own portraits but the progress of such an elaborate piece had ever been interrupted by the tedious labor of the unskilled artist and the restlessness of the lively model with more success they copied animals and insects but love had inspired lycidas to adorn the corner of the apartment occupied by amaryllis there he continually sketched the thousand capricious images dancing in his brain the curious wall was gradually covered with fantastic forms and exhibited a constant spectacle of fancy now the bower of amaryllis was there elegantly festooned and the tendrils of vines were happily flourished by a stroke of the pencil now as his humor prompted the fibers of the leaves were transparently labored while on a delicate stem hung the finished petal of an unfinished flower sometimes he copied a silken white fillet with which amaryllis circled her headdress binding it with scarlet flowers glowing in the midst of their green leaves sometimes he laboriously finished chimerical figures which partly resembled human forms but frequently terminated in that of some animal or wore some ridiculous disproportion provoking laughter and sometimes the face of the volatile amaryllis ending with the plumage of a bird or the mottled wings of a butterfly it was now a torrent foaming on rocks and now a rivulet shaded with elms whose silvery line was poured through the transparent umbrage every object they admired in their walks on his return was sketched or finished on the wall twas now a tree a prospect or the clouds but the loves and the graces often guided his deliriums of imagination and the wall recorded the short annals of their lives and pictured the epochas of his various inventions there were seen the first oversetting of the fish of wood there himself breathing his first flute and amaryllis sketching his first shade the fantastic scenery airy or solemn sketched or elaborate inspired mirth fancy and love such was the origin of the playful arabesques or grotesque paintings the arabesques in a boudoir of raphael where he passed his delicious hours with his favorite mistress fornarina gave the hint of this incident he covered the wall with a number of little genii gamboling and frisking on stalks tendrils twigs and flourishes all marked by strong gesticulations there is also an allegorical picture emblematic of the violence of the passions and to the passions raphael became an enchanting victim the bust of his mistress is repeated several times among these fond and sportive recreations of the painter of ideal beauty in newtons splendid edition of vitruvius the curious reader will find the sentiments of the ancient architect on grotesque paintings  see p     it may be useful to inform some readers that grotesques are ornaments of mere caprice variegated with figures of animals foliage flowers and chimerical objects they have been censured as unnatural it is however easy to conceive how happily they can be arranged by a fine taste and a rich fancy there are some beautiful ones among the engravings of the herculaneum   around their house was an ornamented scenery but as they sometimes bewildered themselves in the neighboring valleys or were desirous of indicating some particular spot they invented local names which were derived from some circumstance one place was distinguished by the kiss and another where amaryllis in eluding lycidas as he chaced the laughing fugitive tumbled down the hill was called the fall a fine walk near the lake through hedges of the arbutus was known by the name of the strawberry walk and a valley luxuriant in flowers by the title of the summer seat there was a favorite spot called the ruins of may one morning in that month amaryllis lay there asleep lycidas passed and observed the indolent maid he hastened to the hedges which were then in full flower and despoiled them and having gathered a panier full of may blossoms he quietly covered the sleeping beauty with their fragrant snows she awoke in a cloud of steaming odours while her pleasuretwinkling eye wondered at the flowery vest that covered her chiding her playful lover for this waste of the young year the fact was recorded in the name given to the place thence called  the ruins of may a similar origin is that of most local names  what now remained to perfect the felicity of our two solitaries their earth was tinted with brilliant flowers their trees bowed their branches with delicious fruit their air was musical with the volant be they glided on the river with a happy audacity the melodies of the nightingale were in their flutes the consolation of absence was found in the pictured form and the gaiety of a playful pencil embodied their fantastic imaginations the charm of an artificial echo resounded in their verses while they traced in their palace the columns which memorised their affections the enchanting miraclcs of art long fascinated their eye vibrating in their hearts the tranquil emotions of beauty while the innocent voluptuousness which nature threw around them solicited their enjoyment often they now turned from the productions of nature and of art to gaze on each other an interior sensation an unknown desire a querulous anxiety existed in their hearts and every day their felicity was diminished  one day as they sat beside an expansive lake they beheld two swans sailing on the stream images of majesty of grace and of peace our lovers reclined admiring each form of elegance and the luminous whiteness of their plumage and all the variety and freedom of their animated attitudes the male was intent to attract the admiration of the female anxious to discover the concealed graces of his beauty yet anxious with pride he arranges his splendid plumage he throws the trailing water from his beak along his shining back and over his freshened wings with the fond solicitude of that being who knows the pleasure of being loved all his figure respires voluptuousness he approaches her he flaps his pinions and the feathery snow sparkles with a preluding caress they wind their sinuous necks around each other their wings yield a confused sound and some white feathers fall on the disturbed lake a continued embrace unites them they pursue each interchange of delight they feel all the shades of sensibility and faint in the ebriety of the senses at length the male is no more majestic he is only tender and lies indolently along the trembling waters again the female returns to her lover again inflames him again incites his last ardours and only quits him reluctantly but to plunge into the stream and to extinguish the fires that still glow in her agitated form buffons sublime description of the camel journeying through the desert has been distinguished by the eulogium of gibbon his description of the swan may deserve an equal though a different applause it abounds with the rich and voluptuous poetry of a philosophic imagination always exact yet always beautiful   when the lovers had gazed on the affectionate swans they turned to each other and sighed lycidas snatched some feathers of the swans as they floated by them and kissed them  how they know he cries to love and to render their love the source of their felicity o amaryllis why is not the sense of our existence the sense of our happiness shall we become old without having known enjoyment  children of nature the universal parent prepares for ye the maturity of happiness she gives ye the soft pains ye now suffer to render the fine pleasures she will bestow on ye more exquisite and pure it is only in a corrupt society curiosity
