j senex at the globe in salisburycourt and w tailor at the ship in paternoster row       mr whistons letter my lord since your lordship had so very considerable a share in the late debates in the house of peers in opposition to a clause for the toleration of the christian religion itself or of all that believed the holy scriptures and the common creed which i confess i had a great hand in preparing and recommending could it have been admitted and in behalf of a new athanasian test to be laid upon christians whereby with the people called quakers they were to profess faith in god the father and in jesus christ his eternal son the true god and in the holy spirit one god blessed for evermore since your lordship had also the like share in a late heavy imputation laid on dr c  in the same house of peers for omitting the holy spirit in doxologies where yet that imputation lay harder on my self nay indeed on st paul and all the apostles themselves than on dr c  he having only omitted the holy spirit in his doxologics sometimes but i in imitation of those apostles never making him the direct object of any doxology at all and since your lordships chaplain mr seaton has lately published an essay on the eternity of the son of god addressed to the laity of this city and written i must confess in a cool and sober manner but as it were in vindication of such your lordships proceedings i think it cannot on all these accounts be improper for me who so greatly dissent from your lordship and your chaplain in these matters to address this paper to your lordship and therein to lay before you and the christian world a fair collection of the sacred and primitive testimonies concerning this important point i mean whether god the father be the only eternal being the only eternal god or whether the son and holy spirit be also eternal beings or be coeternal with the father as all the real trinitarians assert i say real trinitarians only for as for the nominal or modal trinitarians which also include the sabellians and socinians and are now the most numerous who say the son and spirit are not really different from but are or make up together with the father the one eternal god there is no room for the question among them at all it being the absurdest thing in the world to suppose that god is not coeternal to himself though the expression be somewhat extraordinary now in order to satisfy your lordship and the world in this matter i shall beg leave at present to wave the common method of disputing and arguing and pleading and drawing uncertain consequences on either side and shall set down instead thereof a collection of those original texts and testimonies which relate to this important doctrine that so every one may with his own natural common sense and judgment and without fear of being imposed upon by modern inferences impartially pronounce on which side the superior evidence lies your lordship well knows that truth is best discovered by the open fair and solemn way of proceedings in courts of justice where the evidence for facts is still inquired into and examined from eye and earwitnesses or from the authentic records themselves produced in court where the judges determine of those facts entirely by that original evidence and where all that the pleaders allege about those facts goes for nothing any farther than it is thus proved now what was the doctrine of our blessed savior and his apostles or what was the christian faith in this matter is certainly at this day an ancient fact and no otherwise to be now known but by ancient evidence primitive witnesses and original records still remaining to these therefore do i solemnly appeal in the present question and by these and these only do i resolve to be determined therein and this method is so evidently fair and reasonable that i cannot but hope that your lordship and all equitable enquirers will also approve of it and be willing to be determined by it nor do i mean this with regard to the present doctrine or the real and strict coeternity of the son and holy spirit to the father only but with regard to all the like controverted points in christianity also which can i think be no other way so authentickly so satisfactorily and so peaceably determined among christians as by this procedure especially while in this method the meaning of doubtful words and phrases are to be stated no otherwise than by the ancient use of the same and no modern distinctions or evasions unsupported by antiquity will be admitted and where no later translations will be of weight any farther than they are supported by the primary sense of the original in the ages wherein the books themselves were written  i therefore upon this occasion in the most public and open manner in the behalf of my self and of others of my opinion as to the points now in dispute among us do before your lordship and before the christian world invite all the sober and learned athanasians to come into this proposal i mean that omitting all the passions the tricks the subtilties the distinctions and evasions of the pleaders or disputers of this world they will join with us in a calm a fair an authentic a friendly and a christian examination of these points in the bible and primitive antiquity and in drawing up after such an examination an upright impartial and full collection of all the ancient texts and testimonies before the days of athanasius which concern the same to be by joint consent laid before the world with the bare summing up the evidence on both sides as the judges themselves do in their courts without any other comments or colors of our own whatsoever  thus for example the whole christian church my lord did ever and does still unanimously own that there is but one eternal omnipotent invisible and almighty god the original cause and creator of all other beings while many of the trinitarians now affirm that the father son and holy spirit taken together are that one god and we on the other side assert that god the father and he alone is that one god here my lord we insist that the present trinitarians may produce all those original texts of scripture all those ancient creeds and all those primitive testimonies which affirm the former and we will be obliged to produce in the same manner all those original texts of scripture all those ancient creeds and all those primitive testimonies which affirm the latter and this is desired as to both sides without the admission of any novel distinctions evasions or inferences whatsoever that so christian people may have the cause wholly before them and may be enabled to determine sairly and impartially on which side the superior evidence appears to be by which superior evidence all certainly ought to be guided in such matters and the like procedure i would recommend in all parallel cases whatsoever  and indeed my lord this seems to me to be the only honest and christian method of disentangling these and the like points from the sophistry of captious arguments replies and rejoinders with which the writers of controversy do on all sides more or less perplex and puzzle but not properly satisfy their readers and this method i confess my lord i have had principally in my eye from the very beginning of my concern in the present controversy though the pamphlets written against me have sometimes turned me from that my main design and as it were forced me in some degree to comply with the common method i now therefore my lord intend to reassume what i at first proposed to my self and as i have lately which your lordship will see by the enclosed laid the state of the old christian doxologies before the world exactly as i found it in the new testament and in the most early antiquity without pretending from any reasonings of my own to introduce one single form different from what i there found upon record so do i here design to lay before your lordship and the world with equal fairness what i meet with in the first ages concerning this important point of the strict coeternity of the son and holy spirit to the father i say the strict coeternity only for as to the preexistence of our savior before all time and all ages even those the ancients called eternal times with st paul tit i   or before the world with all its creatures and ages began as our version well renders that passage this is not the question heb i   it being allowed on both sides that this world with all its creatures and ages whatsoever were made under the father by the son who must therefore of necessity be before the same without the least consequence to be thence deduced that he was therefore really eternal or truly coeternal with his father  nb i do not quote the smaller epistles of ignatius nor some pretended passages out of hippolytus dionysius alexandrinus etc they being liable to too many objections as to their genuineness to bear any weight in this or any such controversy whatsoever  i begin with those texts of scripture which your lordships chaplain mr seaton has cited for the eternity of the son and shall set them down both as they stand in our english bible and as they more authentickly appear in the septuagint version which alone was made use of by christ and his apostles to which i shall add what other passages occur in the bible or earliest antiquity that seem most to favor the same eternity till the very days of athanasius  prove viii      the lord possessed me created me lxxii the beginning of his ways before his

parallel names  and therefore is it that he is truly and agreeably called a being begotten and a being made and a being created because his substance is not any thing unbegotten    0 god therefore begat him without any change in himself his will going before      whereas therefore there is but one unbegotten being and one begotten the holy spirit cannot he called the son of god nor his

certain rational power which is called by the holy spirit the glory of the lord sometimes the son sometimes wisdom sometimes an angel sometimes god sometimes the lord and the word sometimes he calls himself the general of the host when he appeared in the form of a man to joshua the son of nun and he is called by all these names because of his ministering to his fathers will and because he was begotten voluntarily of the father  but the production which really proceeded from the father before all creatures was with the father and to him did the father speak as the word declares by solomon for in the beginning before all creatures this very offspring was produced by god which by solomon is styled wisdom alluding to prove viii    etc where it is said god created wisdom the beginning  his ways for his works  p     then said trypho let him be owned by you of the gentiles as lord and christ and god as the scriptures declare by you i say who have all obtained the name of christians from

he was a true god or truly god before the world began  apud cave histor literar part ii p     nb this melito wrote a book now lost concerning the creation and generation of christ  tatian   god was in the beginning but we have received this notion that this beginning was the power of the word for the lord of the universe being he in from all things subsist was alone if we regard the creation which was not yet made but if we regard this that all the power of visible and invisible beings subsisted in him all things were with him for with him in metaphysick existence the word himself which was in him subsisted now by his mere will the word came forth but the word proceeding from him who did not thereby become empty became the firstborn work of the father him we know to be the beginning of the world    0 the heavenly word was made a spirit by the father and the word from his rational power according to the image of the father that begat him  theophilus of antioch ad autolyc ii p    god therefore having his word inserted in his own bowels begat him with his wisdom by emission from him before the creation of the universe  p  00 when it pleased god to make whatsoever he had determined then he begat his word by sending him forth the firstborn of the whole creation etc  athenagoras legate        0 if you have a mind out of your depth of understanding to consider what this son means i will briefly inform you he is the first production of the father not as a being made out of nothing for god who from the beginning was an eternal mind had in himself his word or reason being eternally rational but in such manner as when all material beings of unformed matter or earth as their substratum had lighter or heavier parts mixed together he proceeded out to them that they might exist both in idea and reality the prophetic spirit also agrees to this account for says he the lord created me the beginning of his ways for his works  irenaeus v    that his production his firstbegotten word may descend upon his workmanship  tertull adv prax   they say indeed that genesis in the hebrew begins thus in the beginning god made himself a son but suppose that be not certain yet other arguments there are which support my opinion taken from the economy of god in which he was before the constitution of the world until the generation of his son for before all things god was alone etc     hearken therefore to wisdom as to a second person created first we have this the lord created me the beginning of his ways for his works before he made the earth before the mountains were fastened nay he begat me before all the hills     this is the complete nativity of the word in his procession from the father at first created by him so far as thought under the name of wisdom the lord created me the beginning of his ways  adv hermog   because god is both a father and a judge yet was he not therefore always a father and a judge because he was always god for he could not be a father before he had a son nor a judge before there was any sin now there was a time when there was no sin and he had no son the former made him a judge and the latter a father  adv hermog   what other characteristick is there of god than eternity what other meaning is there of eternity than to have always been heretofore and to continue always in being hereafter by that great privilege of no beginning and no end if this be a property of god it must be peculiar to god alone whose property it is for although there be that are called gods whether in heaven or in earth so far as the name extends yet there is but one god the father of whom are all things etc      to conclude as soon as he perceived wisdom was necessary for the making of the world he presently creates her and begets her in himself the lord says wisdom created me the beginning of his ways for his works before the world he founded me before he made the earth before the mountains were fastened he begat me before all the hills  clemens alexan ad

eusebius who by direction from the council of constantinople wrote against athanasiuss great friend the heretic marcellus charges his affirming the son to be  unbegotten as a grand branch of his heresy and to be  eternal as another branch of the same heresy and directly implying the same with unbegotten  ibid the same eusebius says but perhaps thou art afraid that if thou allowest the father and son to be two substances thou should introduce two principles and should deny the divine monarchy learn therefore that since there is but one god without any origin and without generation and that the son is begotten of him there is but one principle and one monarchy and one kingdom since the son himself reckons the father to be his origin for god is the head of christ as the apostle says  demonst evang iv   the father existed before the son and had a subsistence before his generation as being alone unbegotten  cap    god the word was alone begotten of him by a communication from him that begat him who was the unbegotten  first and the greater being and he was declared god of god and called the christ and the anointed  c    therefore o god he has anointed thee who is the supreme and greater being and also thy god so that he who anointed is a great deal prior to him that was anointed being the god of the universe and especially of him who was anointed see maufaucon praeliminar in psalm p     v   the son had not a coexistence with the father without beginning the one being unbegotten the other begotten and the one being the father the other the son and every body will confess that a father does preexist and has an earlier subsistence than a son  vid maufaucon praelimin eusebius in psalm p    the son is the perfect creature of him that is perfect the wise building of him that is wise  he is a being made  ap epiphan haeres    arius in his private letter to his great patron eusebius of nicomedia before the council of nice affirms that this eusebius of caesarea and theodosius and paulinus and athanasius and gregorius and aetius and all the eastern bishops say that god existed before his son without any beginning excepting philogonius and hellanicus and macarius who were no better than uncatechizd heretics  athanas orat ii contr arian let them learn to read after a due manner also what is said in the proverbs which it self has a right meaning for it is written the lord created me the beginning of his ways for his works  nb there is one record ancienter than the council of nice so very remarkable in this case that i cannot forbear to set it down entirely it is a public letter from the presbyters and deacons of alexandria sent on the behalf of the arians to their patriarch alexander who afterward condemned them in these words  the presbyters and deacons to the blessed father our bishop alexander send greeting in the lord  apud athanas de synod arim and seleuc op vol i p         and epiphan haeres lxix   p         our faith which we have received from our forefathers and which blessed father we have learned from you also is this we own but one god who is alone unbegotten who is alone eternal who is alone without beginning who is alone the true god who alone has immortality who alone is wise who alone is good who alone is the potentate who is the judge the orderer and disposer of all things immutable and unalterable righteous and good the god of the law and the prophets and of the new covenant who begat his only begotten son before the world began by whom he made the ages and the universe begat him we mean not in appearance only but reality giving him his subsistence by his own will the immutable and unalterable and perfect creature of god but not as one of the ordinary creatures a being begotten by him but not as one of the ordinary beings which were begotten not that this being begotten was an emanation as was the doctrine of valentinus nor as manichaeus supposed is the being begotten a consubstantial part of the father nor as sabellius who divided the unity and called him both son and father nor as hieraeas light from a light or as one lamp divided into two nor as one that before was yet afterward was begotten or created into a son as even you your self blessed father in the midst of the church and in the assembly of the clergy have frequently rejected those who introduced these opinions but as we say that he was created by the will of god before time and before the world began and that he received his life and his being and all his glory from the father for the father when he made him heir of all things did not deprive himself of any thing which he has in himself without being begotten for he is the fountain of all things wherefore there are three substances and god himself who is the cause of all things is alone without beginning but the son being begotten by the father before time and created and founded before the world began was not before he was begotten but he alone as begotten before time by the father did really subsist for he is not eternal or coeternal or unbegotten as the father is nor has he his existence together with the father as some say who after a sort introduce two unbegotten principles but god is so before all things as the only being and the beginning of all things wherefore he is before his son as we have learned from you when you have preached in the midst of the church in as much therefore as he has his being and all his glory and his life from god and all things are delivered to him thence is god his origin and governor for he governs him as his god and as being prior to him but if that expression from him and that from the womb and that i came out from the father and come are understood as implying his being a consubstantial part of him as an emanation the father is a compound being capable of division and mutable and indeed according to them a body and so as far as their notions extend the incorporeal god is liable to corporeal affections  hist eccl i    sozomen also relates that when this dispute was started at alexandria this alexander knew not at first which side to take and that it was a good while before he yielded to those that said our savior was  consubstantial and coeternal with the father  theodor hist eccl i    the council of nice it self were so far from denying the creation of the son that the words of st paul who styles him the firstborn of the whole creation were by eusebius at first inserted into that creed which he brought into the council and which he informs us the emperor and the whole council agreed to be right though that clause was afterward omitted as not sufficiently favorable to the designs against the arians at that time they were also so far from affirming the real coeternity or proper eternal generation of the son that they only asserted the metaphysick existence of the word before his generation as eusebius shows in the only original account we have of that matter in these words and farther says eusebius there the anathema denounced against such as say he was not before he was begotten did not appear unreasonable since it is confessed by all that he was the son of god even before his generation according to the flesh nay besides this our emperor beloved of god confirmed by reason that even as to his divine generation he was before all ages seeing that before he was actually begotten he was potentially in his father when not yet begotten the father being always a father as he was always a king and a savior and every thing potentially being always thus invariably and unalterably the same  these my lord are the principal original texts and testimonies which concern the important subject before us till the very days of athanasius himself  and now to sum up the evidence on both sides with what clearness i can the evidence for the coeternity of the son to the father which has been above alleged i mean if as we ought to do we take the septuagint version whence christ and his apostles and the ancient fathers always quoted the old testament to be of more authority than our own or any modern ones in such matters comes to no more than this viz that our savior was created or begotten by his father in or before the beginning of the world before all the ages heb i   or that first constitution of things which was made or ordained by him under the father that he was to be the father of the future age or world to come heb ii   which we call the last age or days of the messiah that his origin was of old from the beginning of the world that he was in being and was with god his father in the very beginning of things nay had glory with his father before the world was that he was before all things that he was the first and will be the last that he was alpha and will be omega and that some of these expressions are the same or very like to those by which the absolute eternity of the father is in other places supposed to be expressed which last observation however is only here taken for granted without proof it no way appearing that the sacred writers meddle beyond our faculties with any such absolute eternity either a part ante or a part post as the schoolmen have since done and yet without the proof of that point all this evidence is very inconsiderable  it must also be remembered that the ancient christians ever allowed that the expressions in the old testament concerning the invisible father whenever there was a visible person appeared were spoken by the son as the image of that invisible god or as representing and personating the father as his minister and vicegerent among men and that they never looked on them as true in the highest sense of the son himself but of the father only nor did they ever draw such consequences from those texts as do the moderns  melchisedek is indeed said to have neither beginning of days nor end of life when he is represented as a type of christs earliest origin and latest duration but this certainly without the least pretense to any proper eternity of his at all so that the known books of the old and new testament as understood before the days of athanasius seem to have no proper evidence at all for the real eternity of the son of god as for polycarps and justins expressions of christ that he is the  the eternal priest or high priest no wise man will thence gather any thing about the real eternity of the son before he was an high priest the author of the recognitions also speaks of the eternity of the son and calls him the eternal christ but then it is well known that he did not thereby mean his real coeternity a part ante with his father nay it has appeared already that of all the ancients he is the most express for his being a creature and he therefore hereby rather gives us a rule how we ought to explain such words in other ancient authors while they seldom or never mean by such expressions more than from the beginning of the world or to the end of it irenaeus does indeed say not only that christ was gods eternal word but that he was unmade or as i suppose he means not made out of nothing as he supposed men to be that he did always coexist with god and was ever with him and avoided saying that god created him which the rest used freely to say in those ages all this makes it very probable that this father did believe the eternity of the son in some sort or other but then it must not be dissembled that even irenaeus as we have seen owns him a derived being produced by his father before all other beings which seems hardly reconcilable to an absolute coeternity and that this sort of eternity of the word which we meet with in some such philosophers of the second third and fourth century is quite another thing from the real coeternity of the son under our present consideration as is most obvious in the ancient accounts of that matter their notion was plainly this that all other beings were made out of nothing but that the son was in a subtle manner in his father virtually potentially or as his internal word and wisdom from all eternity and that a little before the creation and not sooner this word was in an ineffable manner begotten or created out of his substance into a real subsisting being or person so that the testimonies for this sort of eternity which alone we find even till a good while after the council of nice it self are a demonstration that the real coeternity of the son with the father or his proper eternal generation was then utterly unknown among christians nor does even this metaphysick this virtual or potential or internal eternity of the son ever appear in the sacred writings in the ancient creeds or liturgies or in any of the apostolical fathers whereby it is plain that it is no part of the sacred the apostolical or the christian doctrine and no more than a conjecture or hypothesis of some ancient christian philosopers whether clement of alexandria ever believed even in his younger years before he was thoroughly instructed in christianity that christ was really eternal it is not certain because the epithet eternal in the former passage cited from him does not always denote a real eternity and may belong to the father and not to the son and if clement did once call him the eternal light in a poem the latitude of such writings especially of that romantic piece ascribed to him into which this phrase is inserted still more plainly forbids us to draw any such settled conclusion from it especially when he elsewhere most plainly said he was the first created wisdom of god and in another work directly depressed him into the rank of a creature as we have already seen so that unless we believe such authors had a fancy that a common creature or the world it self might be coeternal to its creator we must not quote them for the sons proper coeternity to his father and as to the seemingly most express testimonies of eusebius who calls the generation of the son  eternal and says the son was always and  beginningless and at all times with the father that he was elder than all time and all ages before and still before all ages that he subsisted from endless ages or rather before all ages that he was before all was the ancientest being of all time and of all ages that he reigned with his father from beginningless ages and that of the pesbyters and deacons of alexandria that god begat him before eternal times they here according to the ancient style denote no more than that he was before the world began as we are fully assured by many other clearer and plainer passages of the same authors wherein they directly and absolutely deny the sons coeternity with the father notwithstanding as we shall see hereafter  and as to some other of the testimonies omitted in this sum of the evidence they are so little to the purpose that the insisting on them shows how scarce the proofs are on that side  vid jud v   to conclude this head as the greek language has three ways of speaking which are sometimes rendered eternal the first  or  or  or  the second  and the third  the first of which does seldom or never signify a proper eternity the second not always and the third and that alone always does so it is very remarkable that the bible and apostolical fathers never in this case of the antiquity of the son use any but the first none of those before the council of nice more than the first and very rarely the second while athanasius and his followers and none before them directly ventured on the third way of speaking and called the son coeternal which how it could happen if the proper co eternity of the son to the father were then all along the known doctrine of christianity i do by no means understand briefly in the fourth century we find this coeternity plainly asserted we find obscure intimations about a subtle sort of eternity in the third and latter part of the second but in the former part of the second and the first century we lose all certain footsteps of any eternity whatsoever which observation renders this evidence for the coeternity even though we had no opposite evidence to weigh on the other side exceeding weak and precarious  but then as to the original evidence against this coeternity of the son and for his voluntary generation or creation by the power of the father before the world began the sum of it is as follows  that the son was not an underivd unoriginated independent and in that sense an eternal being but truly derived from and produced or begotten by the father is the unanimous voice of all christian antiquity both in and after the apostolical age and is not directly denied by any athanasian at this day now how a confessedly derived produced and begotten being an onlybegotten son should be really coeternal with his underivd unbegotten and necessarilyexisting author producer and father i cannot possibly understand  that the son was also voluntarily begotten by the power of the father we have the plain and numerous testimonies of the apostles themselves in their constitutions of ignatius of the author of the recognitions of clement of justin martyr of tatian of tertullian of novatian of lactantius of eusebius and of the presbyters and deacons of alexandria without the least syllable that any one christian thought of his being derived from the father as the moderns pretend by necessity of nature  that he was also created by god the father is also most evident in all sacred and christian antiquity this doctrine begins from solomon in the old testament as explained by the christian revelation and is continued by the son of sirach and philo the jew to the writers of the new testament peter paul john hermas the apostles in general in their constitutions all these in the first century thence it passes down to ignatius to the author of the recognitions of clement to justin martyr melito tatian and athenagoras in the second century and from all these it comes down to clement of alexandria tertullian origin gregory of neocoesarea novatian cyprian dionysius of alexandria theognostus and methodius in the  d century to lactantius and eusebius and to the alexandrian presbyters and deacons nay even to athanasius himself in the fourth century and this so far as we know without any one persons excepting against the word created as improper till athanasius without any ones asserting that the son was uncreated till he did it and with the direct assertion of several that he was a creature a being made by the father though vastly superior to all other creatures or beings made by him  that the voluntary generation or creation of the son for i take them to mean the same thing was a little before the creation of the world also is the only natural import of almost all and the direct assertion of some of the testimonies without the contradiction of any one christian writer also that i know of till the fourth century or the days of athanasius  that the body of the church even in the beginning of the fourth century nay even at and some years after the council of nice it self knew nothing of any real eternity of the son nor denied that he was a being begotten or created by the will and power of god a little before the beginning of the world is very plain from the testimonies here produced so that it is hard to say what original evidence the real trinitarians have gone upon when they have so long made the world believe that the son is truly coeternal with the father and this as a prime article established at the council of nice nay as a fundamental doctrine of christianity it self since whatever authority there may be for the potential or metaphysick there seems to be directly none at all for this real coeternity or proper eternal generation till a good while after the council of nice nor would the great and learned eusebius when he wrote by the direction of the council of constantinople and several years after that of nice have ventured openly to charge marcellus with heresy for saying that christ was  eternal if that his eternity had been the known determination of the council of nice or indeed the known doctrine of the church either in that or in the foregoing ages of the gospel  that this coeternity of the son is a very strange doctrine to such as have the unity of god for the foundation of their religion such as all the patriarchs the jews and the christians ever had will be granted by all that therefore there was a great occasion for a clear and express declaration of this eternity of the son if it were true is very evident while yet neither the scriptures nor the apostolical constitutions nor any ancient creeds whatsoever have any one such clear declaration nay have many such clear declarations concerning one only true or eternal god romans i  0   timothy     one only eternal power and godhead one only king of ages or eternal immortal invisible the only wise god as supposes the contrary especially while they add to those declarations that this one god is no other than the father of our lord jesus christ  thus all the old creeds or confessions of faith do begin with this as the first doctrine of christianity i believe in one god the father or as the baptismal creed itself expresses it constitut     i believe in one unbegotten being the only true god almighty the father of christ while what they say of the son has not the least intimation of either his coequality or coeternity but the contrary which is particularly the case of the original creed beforementioned where the article concerning the son begins thus i believe in the lord jesus christ the only begotten son of god the firstborn of the whole creation who before the ages was begotten by the good pleasure of the father which seems to me an authentic a sacred and an undeniable testimony against any real coeternity of the son to the father  nor indeed my lord are the expressions all along used in the foregoing collection of texts and testimonies capable of any fair sense consistent with this coeternity since many of them directly confute the same thus the apostolical constitutions affirm that god the father is eternally one only or the only eternal being that those are heretics who say as do the trinitarians in effect that god is three or manifold or that there are three gods coeternal with one another the apostles paul and john by calling christ the firstborn of the whole creation and the beginning of the creation of god do in the most plain usual and obvious sense of the words and as they were understood in the first ages especially if we consider the allusion these passages bear to the text in the proverbs as then understood by all the lord created me the beginning of his ways directly affirm that christ was the first being god created the author to the hebrews directly affirms that god made christ which in the fourth century was reckoned so heterodox that this epistle was in some places seldom read in public and that partly out of the dread of such an expression as philastrius assures us de haeret c      st peter is also introduced in that very ancient book called the preaching of peter as declaring that god made his firstborn son st hermas directly asserts that the holy spirit which was placed in a body or the word of god incarnate was created the first of all beings the apostolical constitutions enjoin us to dedicate our selves to the eternal god not through his coeternal word as the athanasians would certainly have said but through that word which was in the beginning as the greatest antiquity of the son then known in the church ignatius and the author of the recognitions of clement assure us that the very substance of our savior was not the unbegotten substance of the father but was it self begotten by the divine power the author of the recognitions affirms that christ was himself a made being and that the will of god preceded his generation justin martyr who always indeed avoided those expressions himself of a creature and a made being did not yet in the least find fault with trypho the jew when he declared that he understood that both he and the scriptures quoted by him meant that the god of the jews made our lord and god christ jesus nor does this justin among his numerous expressions concerning the sons praeexisting state of which he is so very full ever venture to say any thing that looks like his real coeternity with the father tertullian who yet favored the sons metapyhysick eternity as much as any directly affirms there was a time when god was not a father and had not a son clement of alexandria whatever he had said in his younger years did at last own that christ was the first created wisdom of god and was to be reckoned as a creature origin did also plainly and clearly own that he was one of the creatures of god though the ancientest of em all even so ancient that he cared not to assign the date of his first generation or creation and the reason seems to have been that he had a fancy that the world it self though created by god might possibly be coeternal with its creator gregory of naeocaesarea did also directly profess that christ was a creature or a being made by god novatian also or the acute but unknown author of the book concerning the trinity affirms that god the father is the only eternal god to whom no other being can be so much as compared that the son was then begotten when it pleased the father who and who alone was prior to him and that as a necessary consequence from his being his father dionysius of alexandria directly affirms christ to have been a creature and supposes not only a difference of the subsistences of the father and son but a diversity of substance an inferiority of power and a difference of glory so that he as well as many others seems not to have had so much as a notion of a metaphysick eternity theognostus also declared that the son was a creature lactantius is express for the generation or creation of the son a little before the world was made  the great eusebius whom the athanasians used sometimes to hale over to their party as if he believed the coeternity of the son is so fully understood since the later publication of some of his works long lost that he is now generally allowed as he was in his own age to be clearly against it nor is there room for any dispute since he directly says the father was prior nay a great deal prior to the son and charged marcellus as introducing an heretical notion when he asserted that the son was  eternal which assertion he directly took to be the same as unbegotten of all which opinions of eusebius the very learned monfaucon has given so full an account in his preliminaries to eusebiuss psalms that i reckon none of the truly learned will any more pretend he was an athanasian nor will any one doubt of the opinion of many of the bishops in the east and in egypt hardly indeed of alexander of alexandria and of the council of nices own opinion against the proper coeternity collection of ancient monuments by me who carefully peruses the original records here and elsewhere published relating to that age which yet was generally disposed to advance the dignity and antiquity of the son as much as possible i now proceed to the other point the coeternity of the holy spirit  the texts and testimonies which prove that the holy spirit was created or made under the father by the son before the world began and against his coeternity paul christ through  the eternal or holy spirit so twelve or thirteen of the copies read of the text offered himself without spot to god  peter   pet     the spirit of christ  apostles constitut vi    one god the father of one son not of many the maker of one comforter by christ  vii    i am also to be baptized unto the holy ghost that is the comforter who wrought in all the saints from the beginning of the world  justin apol i    the spirit spoke in the prophets as from the divine word that moved them  ibid    plato read that it was said by moses that the spirit of god moved on the face of the waters he assigns the third place to the spirit that is said to have moved on the water when he says but the third sort of offices belong to the third person  athenagoras legate   all things are held together by that spirit which is derived from him  theophilus of antioch ad antotyc i p    he begat him together with his wisdom and sent him out before the beginning of the world  this person then being the spirit of god and the origin of things and wisdom and the power of the most high descended upon the prophets and by them spoke what concerned the making of the world and all other things for the prophets were not in being when the world was made but that wisdom which was in him which was the wisdom of god and his holy word which is always present with him etc  irenaeus i    by his word and spirit he makes and orders and governs all things  iv    there do minister to the father his own offspring and his own figuration that is the son and holy spirit his word and wisdom     there are ever present with god his word and wisdom the son and spirit by whom and in whom he made all things freely and spontaneously to whom also he spoke saying let us make man after our image and after our likeness  ibid and that wisdom which is the spirit was with god before the entire constitution of things he says by solomon god by wisdom has founded the earth by prudence has he prepared the heaven by his understanding the abysses brake forth and the clouds dropped down dew and again the lord created me the beginning of his ways for his works before the world he founded me in the beginning before he made the earth before the fountains of waters came before the mountains were fastened he begat me before all the hills etc  v   man was made by the hands of the father i e by the son and holy spirit after the likeness of god  author of the recognations      we say the son of god is the only begotten being derived from no other origin but begotten or born of him after an ineffable manner in like manner do we speak of the comforter  iii    whereas then there is one unbegotten being and one begotten the holy spirit cannot be called a son nor the firstbegotten for he was made by a being that was himself made but he is recounted in subordination to the father and the son as the first perfect effect of the power of the second being  tertull adv prax i suppose the spirit is derived from no other origin than from the father by the son  origin comment in joan p          we must enquire whether it follows from this place which affirms that all things were made by the word that the holy spirit was made by him also for i suppose he that says the holy spirit is a being made and admits of this assertion that all things were made by the word must of necessity grant that the holy spirit was made by him and that by consequence  nb the word was more ancient than he but he that will not admit that the holy spirit was made by christ must by consequence say he is unbegotten if he withal judges what is said in the gospel to be true  we who are persuaded that the father son and holy spirit are three substances and do believe there is nothing unbegotten but the father do admit this notion as most agreeable to piety and truth that when all things are said to be made by the word the holy spirit is the most honorable and first in order of those beings which the father made by christ etc  eusebius de eccles theolog iii   now the son alone is honored with the paternal divinity and has the power of making and creating all things that are made visible and invisible and even is the producer of the existence of the spirit the comforter himself for all things were made by him and without him not one thing was made and by him were all things created both those in heaven and those on earth whether they be visible or invisible  now the son is the only begotten god who is in the bosom of the father but the spirit the comforter is neither god nor the son of god because he did not receive his generation from the father in the same manner as did the son but is one of those beings which were made by the son for all things were made by him and without him not one thing was made these are then the mysteries of the catholic and holy church delivered by the divine oracles while marcelius confounding all things  introduces one substance with three persons and three names therein saying that god and the word which is in him and the holy spirit are all one  these my lord are the chief among the primitive texts and testimonies concerning the origin of the holy spirit which are so much on one side even till long after the council of nice that i have not found it necessary to divide them under two heads as i did those of the son since the only valuable testimony that may seem to favor the real eternity of the holy spirit which is that in the epistle to the hebrews of the eternal spirit uses only the word  which seldom or never signifies a proper eternity since so many of the copies have not there even that epithet but the usual one of holy instead of eternal spirit and since it is not certain that this place belongs to the third person at all but perhaps to the divine nature or word it self in christ bull defens fid nicaen sect i   which grotius and bishop bull have showed several times to have the character of an holy spirit so that i have no occasion here to sum up the evidence on both sides at all as to the coeternity of the holy spirit to the father or even as to his equal antiquity with the son for either of which there is not that i know of one proper or direct testimony sacred or primitive now extant in the records of the christian church till long after the council of nice in the latter days of athanasius himself  and now my lord i beg that your lordship will please soberly to review the evidence that is here produced before you and the world and will suppose your self in the high court of chancery in the same capacity as your noble father formerly presided there and will put the case that your lordship had an exactly parallel cause before you that the witnesses were as numerous and as plain on each side as these here produced appear to be and no otherwise and that your lordship were obliged to proceed exactly secundum allegata and probata which is the known rule of that and all other like courts of justice and equity among us and i thereupon appeal to your lordship supposing you had no bias on either side as no upright judge ought to have whether you could possibly with a safe conscience determine on the side representing the athanasians whether in a point where the general light of nature and common sense is so strong against the athanasian doctrine the testimonies for it comparatively so few and so uncertain and those against it so very many and so very pregnant whether i say your lordship could possibly with a safe conscience pronounce from this evidence that the son of god and his holy spirit are strictly coeternal to the supreme god the father as the athanasians affirm or whether you would not be forced to declare in agreement with the voice of natural the patriarchal the jewish and the original christian religion that there is but one eternal being one eternal god and that he is no other than the father of our lord jesus christ  and here my lord give me leave to wish heartily to wish that these ancient texts and testimonies thus plainly produced before you in this one important article might so far influence your lordship as to engage you to endeavor that the same method might be taken in the other branches of this and all other the like controversies among christians that your lordship who has had long so considerable a hand in the public management of affairs sacred and ecclesiastical as well as temporal and civil in this nation might be a happy means of bringing all the parts of our old genuine christianity to such a fair open and impartial examination as i have here proposed and endeavored to exemplify in these papers that so party faction and prejudice laid aside all honest and sober christians might in a peaceable manner unite together into such societies for promoting primitive christianity as has been formerly exemplified at my house or however might jointly prosecute the same pious designs for the discovery and restoration of the pure and holy religion of our savior christ as it was once delivered to the saints by such other christian methods as they should judge might better tend to the same excellent end  it has hitherto been your lordships great glory to have supported and encouraged that church of england in which you was educated and the world has great reason to believe by your daily religious attendance on the churchs liturgy at home as well as by your alike devout weekly attendance on the same public service at church either of which in our age i am sorry to say it is but too uncommon in persons of your lordships quality that you are in earnest in such your support and encouragement thereof or that you do it because you believe this church to be truly agreeable to the primitive state of the gospel would it not therefore my lord be still more highly honorable for your lordship to be a means of making a more careful review of our doctrine worship practice and discipline that so the same church which has long been the glory and bulwark of the protestant religion even in it is present imperfect state may first of all the rest be exactly conformed to the perfection of the christian settlement and so may be the great exemplar and pattern of all the other churches as they become gradually sensible of the necessity of such a farther reformation all the modern churches and among them our own are to be sure very unwilling to allow that they stand in any great need of a farther reformation but as your lordship will easily observe that the learned members of every one of these modern churches declare such a farther reformation to be necessary in all other churches but their own so am i very sure that the truly learned and impartial of every one of them who have carefully compared the present settlements with that of the first three centuries of christianity do privately know how little soever they may publicly confess that every one of the present churches without exception do stand in no small need of such a farther reformation i beg leave my lord to conclude here very nearly in the words with which i formerly ended my fourth volume of primitive christianity revived  i do here solemnly appeal as to the truth and fairness of my quotations and assertions here and elsewhere to archbishop wake bishop hooper bishop smalridge bishop potter bishop chandler l c j king sir isaac newton dr bentley dr whitby dr clarke dr hare dr marshal dr waterland mr wall mr gale mr reeves and the other great masters of primitive antiquity and claim it as the right of truth and religion that they speak their minds fairly and fully as they will answer it to our common lord another day when no political prudential or temporal regards will be admitted against the plain demands of conscience and sincerity and i humbly move those in authority that they procure this whole matter to be impartially and publicly examined as the other popish doctrines were at the beginning of the reformation and if the common opinions appear not only destitute of but contrary to the evidence of scripture and the first centuries as i am fully persuaded they will that then care be taken to cast them out of the church and to amend and reform all our public offices creeds and articles and reduce them all to the primitive standards i also humbly move that in order to these and the like amendments and improvements in our ecclesiastical establishment the pretensions of that wonderful book still extant the apostolical constitutions be examined with the like care and in the same public manner and so far as it shall appear to be a genuine uncorrupted apostolical work by clemens romanus with the addition of the most authentic original jewish and gentile public liturgies as i am fully persuaded it will it may then be allowed its due weight in the amendment of the doctrine discipline government worship and canons of the church or rather that it may entirely be admitted as an original rule and standard in those matters as all christians who believe them genuine and for the main incorrupt are immediately obliged to do especially since the leaving these constitutions and setting up other doctrines and orders in their stead seem to have been the very causes of almost all the antichristian corruptions of these last   00 or   00 years together but if all these my honest and wellmeant endeavors and desires be rejected and instead of any reformation i my self be traduced and abused and persecuted i can only acquiesce in the sense of having sincerely with some trouble and hazard to my self in this world discharged my duty and patiently wait for my reward in that which is to come for as to those anathemas or names of distinction and reproach which in this case i must expect i value them not at all as having long accustomed my self to govern both my belief and my life by the original standards of christianity without regard to the contrary opinions and practices of these later and corrupter ages and so liberavi animam meam  i am my lord with great respect  your lordships most humble and obedient servant will whiston july  0      books printed for j senex in
