a brief view of the figures and explication of the metaphors contained in scripture  by john brown minister of the gospel at haddington  john v    search the scriptures  hos xii  0 i have used similitudes by the ministry of the prophets  edinburgh printed by and for gavin alston mdcclxxxii  the preface the advantage of a clear comprehensive and regular view of the figures the types and the predictions of scripture is obvious in the first we observe the surprising eloquence of heaven and discern almost every form in nature a guide to and an illustrator of inspired truth by the second we perceive the whole substance of the gospel of christ truly exhibited in ancient shadows persons and things  in laws apparently carnal and trifling in the third we observe how astonishingly inspired predictions properly arranged and compared with the history of nations and churches do illustrate each other and modern events as with the evidence of miracles confirm our faith in the oracles of god the usefulness of what i have attempted with respect to all the three must be lest to the providence of god  the subsequent meditations relate to the figures of sacred writ to avoid too peremptory parallels and to awaken devotion they are cast into the present form the emblems the signification of which appeared uncertain or diversified are repeated under different heads to shun interfering with types many rich emblems as of zion priests etc are wholly omitted or but slightly touched to shun a tiresome length and a sinking dullness that which was just before hinted on a similar emblem is not seldom passed over and the history of emblems is lest to be collected from the account of the objects which they represent nor on this are ought but hints offered and the enlargement is left to the readers own meditation what friendly indulgence is requisite to pardon mistakes the peruser must judge meanwhile it is hoped he will remember that the espial of faults is much easier work than to avoid them  the contents book i  a general view of the figures of scripture language p        book ii  explication of metaphors respecting persons viz god p     christ     the holy ghost  0   holy

contains a whole system of divine truth represented in scripturemetaphors  a brief view of the figures and explication of metaphors contained in scripture book i scripture language in general in the manner of the east the language of inspiration abounds with the most striking and instructive figures in noble and candid simplicity  in bold allusion not all the writings of men can vie with these oracles of god here  as one would expect in the idiom of godhead the principal truths are brought down to the weakest capacity that ignorance may have nothing to plead for excuse others chiefly predictions are often wrapped up in figures obscure and hard to be understood thus till the fulfillment the learned are forced to acknowledge their ignorance and malicious opposers rendered incapable to stop the predicted event  the figures of sacred language are either simple or complex the former without changing the native sense of the words embellish the style enliven the representation or illustrate the subject the latter while they ennoble the style and illustrate the subject do also convert the terms from their ordinary signification to another connected with it  simple figures are   a repetition of the same term or phrase whether in the same or in different sentences of a chapter or section as of my psalm xviii       my god psalm xxii   and cxviii    my help psalm cxxi      whatsoever things are phil iv   his mercy endures for ever psalm cxxxvi lord our lord etc psalm viii       diversifying of the sense while the sound is nearly retained thus walk in the flesh and war after the flesh agree pretty much in found but differ vastly in sense   changing of the sense of a word in the same sentence thus good in matthew xix    signifies first what is good and useful in a limited sense and then what is infinitely and originally good fruit of the vine matthew xxvi    both signifies natural wine and eternal happiness   conformation of the sound of the terms to the mournful the joyful the terrible deterstable or amiable nature of the subject thus the portion of the wicked is described in words sounding forth terror psalm xi     the last day in most dreadful language   pet iii  0      outcries of admiration abhorrence derision commendation wishing pity joy grief as how great is his goodness zech ix    o wretched man that i am etc romans vii    o woman great is thy says matthew xv      corrections of what was just before asserted as yet not i but christ lives in me gal ii  0 yet not i but the grace of god   cor xv  0   in promises the reward and especially that which is terrible in a threatening complaint or oath is sometimes partly suppressed as he shall be chief ana captain   samuel v   i will drive him out genesis iii    will thou cast me off psalm vi   let me cease to exist if i lie psalm lxxxix      interrupting addresses as of nehemiah to god chap iv     of god by joel to the hebrews chap ii       of david to the mountains of gilboa to the daughters of israel to jonathan   samuel i               introduction of speeches real or feigned as of the chosen ruler of judah is iii   of their women is iv   of the firtrees and of the dead is xiv     of hell and destruction job xxviii    when these speeches are wicked they are sometimes expressed not as uttered by the author but as they truly meant thus sinful means of relief are called a covenant with hell and agreement with death is xxviii    flattering prophecies are called deceits is xxx  0 false witnesses are called sons of belial   kings xxi  0  0 questions expressive of absurdity wonder doubt demonstration expostulation anger insult grief negation pity desire refusal prohibition as how can a man be born when he is old john iii   how excellent is thy loving kindness psalm xxxvi   shall sarah that is ninety years old bear genesis xvii    is anything too hard for the lord genesis xviii    etc    appeals to those who are argued against as of the apostles to the jewish rulers acts iv    of paul to the galatians chap iii      retortion or throwing back an accusation or objection on the starter of it so god throws back the charge of injustice on the jews who charged him with it ezekiel xviii the syrophenician woman pleads the character of a dog thrown out against her  as an argument for mercy matthew xv       to repel the question by what authority he acted jesus posed the inquirers whether the baptism of john was from heaven or of men matthew xxi           prevention of objections by answering them before they be started thus the objection of gods deserting his church is prevented is xlix          an apparent yielding of that which an opposer pleads in order to show its absurdity or its insufficiency to establish the point in dispute so paul grants the jews to have great knowledge of the law and a capacity to instruct others  in order to show them how their sin in breaking the law was aggravated romans ii        james grants the ungodly professor that he had faith but shows that the devils also believed and trembled jam ii       assignation of the reason of an action or name thus paul was not ashamed of the gospel because it was the power of god for salvation to believers and it was so because therein the righteousness of god was revealed romans i       the law silenceth and condemns all men because by it is the knowledge of sin and therefore by the deeds of it shall no flesh be justified romans iii     0 no man can be saved by the law because it works wrath in our corrupt nature against god and condemns us to his just wrath romans iv          lively descriptions which as it were present the objects to our eyes and other senses as of tophet is xxx    of goliath   samuel xvii      of gods compassion jer xxxi  0 hos xi        digressions in which the speaker for a time turns aside from his immediate subjects and descants upon an object occasionally mentioned thus the apostles often turn aside to discourse concerning jesus christ as rev i      col i           transitions in which one part of the sentence respects that which went before and another what follows thus covet earnestly the best gifts respects what precedes and i show you a more excellent way that which follows   cor xii       contrasts in which subjects dissimilar are compared in order to mark clearly the nature value or unworthiness of the one so the condition of the wicked is contrasted with that of the righteous psalm i gods kindness and mens unfruitfulness and wickedness are contrasted is v      men and the holy ghost are contrasted acts v    0 comparison of things like or unlike in order to argue from the one to the other thus christ argues from the lesser to the greater matthew vi  0 and vii    and that god is to feared rather than men matthew x       induction by which compound things are represented in their various parts and here there is generally an ascending as to the object or the language thus the desolation of a country is described from the case of the fields the inhabitants people priest servant master seller buyer etc is xxiv       gods just judgment is represented in his rewarding the righteous and punishing the wicked romans ii      the resurrection is described as partly to happiness and partly to damnation john v       christs state is described from the debased and exalted circumstances of it phil i     0 thus the sin or the judgment of men is often described in a variety of particulars ezekiel xxii and xxiii    crowding of various qualities or things into one sentence as of sacrifices rams bullocks lambs hegoats vain oblations new moons sabbaths assemblies is i          of foreknowledge predestination calling justificatin glorification romans viii     0    redoubld representations in which objects are representd first more obscurely and then more plainly as har the right attend to my cry give car to my prayer psalm xvii   water and the spirit john iii   thy silver is become dross thy wine is mixed with water thy princes are rebellious and companions of thieves is i          circumlocutions in which for modesty or to sweeten or heighten the language the proper name of an object is avoided and an indirect description is given in its stead so a chamber pot is called a vessel wherein there is no pleasure jer xxii     urine is called the waters of the feet   kings xviii    heb death is called the king of terrors job xviii       references in which the words or sense of another speaker or writer are quoted or alluded to here the words are sometimes quoted in a sense which they did not originally seem to bear and sometimes the terms or the sense of diverse passages are conjunctly quoted into one  quotations or allusions abound in the new testament matthew i    and xxi     acts vii    etc etc concerning which many excellent observations may be found in carpzows defense of the bible  complex figures are metonymy synecdoche meiosis hyperbole irony metaphor  by metonymy the name of one object is given to another because of some connection not similitude betwixt them thus   the name of the matter the author the cause or instrument is given to that which is produced from or by it or the name of the effect is given to the author cause or instrument thus the wood in the houses and furniture of jerusalem is called a forest jer xxi    ezekiel xx    the temple for its plenty of cedarwood that grew in lebanon is called lebanon zech xi   a heavenly frame is called the spirit rev i  0 the name of a father as of jacob moab etc is given to his posterity is xliii    and

because he is the author of it genesis xlix    esaus taking canaanitish wives is called a grief i e a cause of grief genesis xxvi    the gospel is called the power of god i e the instrument of exerting it romans i    victory over the world is called faith as faith obtains it   john v   the transgression of israel is called samaria and the high places of judah jerusalem because these cities chiefly promoted wickedness and idolatry mic i   wisdom and knowledge are called stability because they are the means of it is xxxiii     the name of a subject is given to its adjunct and of an adjunct to its subject thus a city a country the earth the world is put for the inhabitants of it jer iv    genesis vi    a cup for that which is contained in it   cor xi    this cup etc psalm xxxiii   a nest for the pullets in it deuteronomy xxii    the heart for the desires or other things contained in it psalm lxii   pour out your hearts the name of a possessor is given to what is possessed so christs people are called himself matthew xxv        acts ix     cor xii    so the lord i e what offerings belonged to him is called levis inheritance deuteronomy x   the name of the thing signified is given to the sign so the wine in the lords supper is called christs blood or the new testament in it matthew xxvi    and of the sign to the thing signified the sovereign rule is called a scepter genesis xlix  0 the name of the quality is given to its subject so a scarlet and crimson colored thing is called scarlet and crimson is i    the name of that which is contained is given to that which contains it so fields are called the upper and nether springs josh xv      names are put for the person or thing named so the name of christ or of god often signifies precisely christ or god himself acts iv    deuteronomy xxviii      persons and things are named according to appearance not reality so angels are called men genesis xviii satan is called samuel   samuel xxviii      0 error is called

roman empire the gentiles the wicked the antichristians luke ii     john ii   and v    rev xiii   every creature for men mark xvi    or the plural number for the singular as children for child genesis xxi     more restricted terms are put for such as are more extensive as one for all of the kind psalm i   yesterday for time past heb xiii   a limited number as thrice seven or ten times for frequently   cor xii   psalm cxix     a thousand five thousand for an uncertain number is xxx      a whole person thing place or time is put for an adjunct or part of it so christ is said to die to be buried when only his body died and was buried john xix    and ii    world is put for canaan romans iv    north for caldea jer i    for ever for a long time dan ii     a part of a person thing place or time is put for the whole of it so souls denote human persons acts ii    resurrection is put for christs whole appearance in our nature acts i    hour for a period of time john iv     by meiosis a great deal less is expressed than is really signified thus in the negative precepts much more is intended than is literally expressed exodus xx        by hyperbole things are represented as far more insignificant great glorious or numerous than they really are so the hebrew spies are represented as grasshoppers numb xiii    the top of a tower or wall is said to reach to heaven genesis xi   deuteronomy xi   the histories of all christs works could not be contained rather perused by the world john xxi    the israelites are represented as in number like to the sand on the sea shore or dust of the earth genesis xiii    and xxii    so contentions are called wars jam iv   plenty of milk honey and butter or oil is represented as rivers of it job xxix   saul and jonathan are represented as swifter than eagles and stronger than lions   samuel i    the terms of this figure must always be understood with due limitation  by irony words are uttered with such an air or other circumstance as makes them bear a signification quite contrary to their common one as let them the false gods rise up and help you deuteronomy xxxii    bless god and die job ii    rejoice o young man etc eccl xi   sleep on now etc matthew xxvi    cry aloud for he is a god etc   kings xviii    go up and prosper for the lord shall deliver it etc   kings xxii    when the irony is extremely sharp and reproachful it is called a sarcasm as a goodly price etc zech xi    how glorious was the king of israel to day   samuel vi  0 he trusted in god psalm xxii    by metaphor the names qualities and actions proper to some persons or things are ascribed to other persons or things because of some likeness between them these of rational beings are ascribed to other rational beings so satan is called a god ministers angels etc those of inanimate things to other inanimate things so gods purpose or gospel is called a foundation etc these of living creatures to things without life so the creation is said to groan to travail to will etc those of things without life to such as have it so christ is called a way a door the truth etc  that by comparing the volumes of nature with the oracles of god we may be always and everywhere surrounded with spiritual monitors no figure is more frequent than this nor is there almost any thing in nature from which it is not drawn particularly   from rational beings as god holy angels devils chiefly from men in their parts soul body flesh blood bones head face eyes ears nose mouth cheeks locks hair neck shoulder back belly hands loins bowels navel bosom knees legs feet in

testament institutions as from adam david solomon israel priests levites canaan jerusalem zion tabernacle temple holy of holies altar mercyseat sacrifices first fruits circumcision sprinkling of blood anointing with oil new moons passover feast of tabernacles baptism etc  to understand metaphors it must be observed that the foundation thereof is likeness between the things from which the metaphor is drawn and that to which it is applied when this likeness is exhibited in one or a few expressions it is a simple metaphor when it is pursued with a variety of expressions or there is a continued assemblage of metaphors it is called an allegory when the resemblance is harsh and far fetched as to set a voice it is a catachresis when it is couched in a short saying obscure and ambiguous it is called a riddle when it is couched in a short saying commonly used it is termed a proverb when the metaphoric representation is delivered in form of a history it is a parable   because every thing has various qualities and operations one thing may be the metaphorical emblem of persons or things different or contrary so a lion is the emblem of god of christ of satan and of men good and bad   the difference between the emblem and the object of the metaphor that is between that from which the metaphor is drawn and that which it exhibits renders it impossible for any metaphor fully to represent its object and absurd to expect that an universal similitude betwixt the emblem and the object should ever be found   hence it sollows that to squeeze metaphors by running the parallel further than truth and decency with respect to the emblem and object will admit is not to illustrate but to discredit and darken the mysteries of god   nay in the sacred metaphors one particular is generally the principal thing thereby exhibited this by the attentive reader or preacher should from the circumstances of the text or context be especially enquired after and considered  book ii metaphors

affection toward his creatures things respecting man almost innumerable are divinely constituted the emblems of his perfections and works he is called the head of christ to him as man and mediator he

gave it to the jews and sent his prophets to demand that they should give him the glory due to his name these being injuriously maltreated he sent his son whom it might have been expected they would reverence and regard but they murdered him that they might live as they listed for these things god miserably destroyed the jewish nation and gave the gospel to the gentiles that they might bring forth fruits of good works answerable to it    it is compared to the hiring of laborers at different hours to work in a vineyard and giving all equal wages matthew xx        in the morning of the patriarchal in the noontide of the ceremonial at the ninth hour of the apostolic age in the eleventh hour of the future millennium or thousand years reign of the saints multitudes are divinely invited
