essays on the principles of morality and natural religion in two parts  edinburgh printed by r fleming for a kincaid and a donaldson  m dcc li  advertisement it is proper to acquaint the reader before he enters on the following essays that they are not thrown together without connection the first by the investigation of a particular fact is designed to illustrate the nature of man as a social being the next considers him as the subject of morality and as morality supposes freedom of action this introduces the third essay which is a disquisition on liberty and necessity these make the first part of the work the rest of the essays ushered in by that on belief hang upon each other a plan is prosecuted in support of the authority of our senses external and internal where it is occasionally shown that our reasonings on some of the most important subjects rest ultimately upon sense and feeling this is illustrated in a variety of instances and from these the author would gladly hope that he has thrown new light upon the principles of human knowledge  all to prepare the way for a proof of the existence and perfections of the deity which is the chief aim in this undertaking the authors manner of thinking may in some points be esteemed bold and new but freedom of thought will not displease those who are led in their inquiries by the love of truth to such only he writes and with such he will at least have the merit of a good aim of having searched for truth and endeavored to promote the cause of virtue and natural religion  essays on the principles of morality and natural religion  part i  essay i of our attachment to objects of distress a noted french author who makes critical reflections upon poetry and painting undertakes a subject attempted by others unsuccessfully which is to account for the strong attachment we have to objects of distress not real objects only but even fictitious it is not easy says he to account for the pleasure we take in poetry and painting which has often a strong resemblance to affliction and of which the symptoms are sometimes the same with those of the most lively sorrow the arts of poetry and painting are never more applauded than when they succeed in giving pain a secret charm attaches us to representations of this nature at the very time our heart full of anguish rises up against its proper pleasure i dare undertake this paradox continues our author and to explain the foundation of this sort of pleasure which we have in poetry and painting an undertaking that may appear bold if not rash seeing it promises to account to every man for what passes in his own breast and for the secret springs of his approbation and dislike our author is extremely sensible of the difficulty of his subject and no wonder for it has a deep foundation in human nature  let us follow him in this difficult undertaking he lays it down as a preliminary that our wants and necessities are our only motives to action and that in relieving us from them consists all natural pleasure and in this by the way he agrees with mr lock in his chapter of power sect    and    this account of our natural pleasures shall be afterward examined what we have at present to attend to is the following fundamental proposition laid down by our author that man by nature is designed an active being that inaction whether of body or mind draws on languor and disgust and that this is a cogent motive to fly to any sort of occupation for relief thus adds he we fly by instinct to every object that can excite our passions and keep us in agitation not rebuted by the pain such objects often give us which causes vexatious days and sleepless nights but man notwithstanding suffers more by being without passions than by the agitation they occasion this is the sum of his first section in the second he goes on to apply his principle to particular cases the first he gives is that of compassion whereby we are naturally impelled to dwell upon the miseries and distresses of our fellow creatures though thereby we come to be partakers of their sufferings an impulse that he observes is entirely owing to the above principle which makes us choose occupation however painful rather than be without action another is that of public executions we go in crowds says he to a spectacle the most horrid that man can behold to see a poor wretch broke upon the wheel burnt alive or his intrails torn out the more dreadful the scene the more numerous the spectators yet one might foresee even without experience that the cruel circumstances of the execution the deep groans and anguish of a fellow creature must make an impression the pain of which is not to be effaced but by a long course of time but the attraction of agitation is far more strong upon most people than the joint powers of reflection and experience he goes on to mention the strange delight the roman people had in the entertainments of the amphitheatre criminals exposed to be torn to pieces by wild beasts and gladiators in troops set out to butcher one another he takes this occasion to make the following observation upon the english nation so tender hearted is that people that they observe humanity toward their greatest criminals they allow of no such thing as torture alleging it better to let a criminal go unpunished than to expose an innocent person to those torments which are authorized in other christian countries to extort a confession from the guilty yet this people so respectful of their kind have an infinite pleasure in prizefighting bullbeating and such other savage spectacles he concludes with showing that it is this very horror of inaction which makes people every day precipitate themselves into play and deliver themselves over to cards and dice none but fools and sharpers says he are moved to play by hope of gain the generality of mankind are directed by another motive they neglect those diversions where skill and address are required choosing rather to risque their fortunes at games of mere chance which keep their minds in continual motion and where every throw is decisive  this is our authors account of the matter fairly stated it has i acknowledge an air of truth but the following considerations convince me that is not solid in the first place if the pain of inaction be the motive which carries us to such spectacles as are above mentioned we must expect to find them frequented by none but those who are oppressed with idleness but this will not be found the truth of the matter all sorts of people flock to such spectacles pictures of danger or of distress have a secret charm which attracts men from the most serious occupations and operates equally upon the active and the indolent in the next place were there nothing in these spectacles to attract the mind abstracting from the pain of inaction there would be no such thing as a preference of one object to another upon any other ground than that of agitation and the more the mind was agitated the greater would be the attraction of the object but this is contrary to experience there are many objects of horror and distaste which agitate the mind exceedingly that even the idlest fly from and a more apt instance need not be given than what our author himself cites from livy lib    who speaking of antiochus epiphanes has the following words gladiatorum munus romanae consuetudinis primo majore cum terrore hominum insuetorum ad tale spectaculum quam voluptate dedit deinde saepius dando et familiare oculis gratumque id spectaculum fecit et armorum studium plerisque juvenum accendit such bloody spectacles behoved undoubtedly to make at first a greater impression than afterward when by repetition they were rendered familiar yet this circumstance was so far from being an attraction to the grecians that it raised in them aversion and horror upon the same account the beargarden which is one of the chief entertainments of the english is held in abhorrence by the french and other polite nations it is too savage an entertainment to be relished by those of a refined taste  if man is considered as a being whose only view in all his actions is either to attain pleasure or to avoid pain we must conclude pleasure and pain to be his only impulses to action upon that supposition it would be hard if not impossible to give any satisfactory account why we should choose with our eyes open to frequent entertainments which must necessarily give us pain but when we more attentively examine human nature we discover many and various impulses to action independent of pleasure and pain let us follow out this thought because it may probably lead to a solution of the problem  when we attend to the impressions made by external objects or to any of our impressions we find few of them so simple as to be altogether without modification impressions are either strong or weak distinct or confused etc there is no division of impressions more comprehensive than into agreeable or disagreeable some slight impressions there may be which give us little or no pleasure or pain but these may be neglected in the present inquiry the bulk of our impressions may certainly be distinguished into pleasant and painful it is unnecessary and would perhaps be in vain to search for the cause of this difference among our impressions more we cannot say than that such is the constitution of our nature so contrived by the author of all things in order to answer wise and good purposes  there is another circumstance to be attended to in these impressions that desire enters into some of them aversion into others with regard to some objects we feel a desire of possessing and enjoying them other objects raise our aversion and move us to avoid them at the same time desire and aversion are not separate impressions but modifications only each making a part of the total impression raised by the agreeable or disagreeable object the pleasure for example of a fine garden and the desire of possessing it are not different impressions but only parts of that entire impression which is caused by the object the impression made by any object is one though it may be annalized into parts it does not belong to the present subject to inquire in what instances desire is raised by agreeable objects for desire does not accompany agreeable impressions in every instance but it must be carefully attended to that aversion does not make a part or enter into the composition of every painful impression objects of horror and terror loathsome objects and many others raise aversion but there are many impressions some of them of the most painful sort which have no degree of aversion in their composition grief is a most painful passion or impression and yet is the farthest of any thing from being mixed with any degree of aversion on the contrary we cling to the object which raises our grief and love to dwell upon it compassion is an instance of the like nature objects of distress raise no aversion in us though they give us pain desire always makes a part of the impression desire to afford relief  in infancy appetite and passion and the desires and aversions accompanying them are our sole impulses to action but in the progress of life when we learn to distinguish the objects around us as contributing to pleasure or pain we acquire by degrees impulses to action of a different sort selflove is a strong motive to search about for every thing that may conduce to happiness selflove operates by means of reflection and experience and every object so soon as discovered to contribute to our happiness raises of course a desire of possessing hence it is that pleasure and pain are the only motives to action so far as selflove is concerned but our appetites and affections as above explained are very different in their nature these operate by direct impulse without the intervention of reason and answer to what is called instinct in brute creatures as they are not influenced by any sort of reasoning the view of shunning misery or acquiring happiness makes no part of the impulsive cause it is true that the gratification of our affections and appetites is for the most part attended with pleasure and it is also true that in giving way to a particular appetite the view of pleasure may by a reflex act become an additional motive to the action but these things must not be confounded with the direct impulse arising from the appetite or affection which as i have said operates blindly and in the way of instinct without any view to consequences  and to ascertain the distinction betwixt actions directed by selflove and actions directed by particular appetites and passions it must be further remarked that though for the most part pleasure is the consequence of indulging appetites and passions it is not necessarily nor indeed universally so if the latter be made out the former will be evident because there cannot be a necessary connection betwixt two things which are in some instances separated that pleasure is not always the consequence of indulging our appetites and passions will be plain from induction revenge gratified against the man we hate is attended with pleasure it is a very different case where we have taken offense at a man we love friendship will not allow me however offended to hurt my friend i cannot find in my heart to do him mischief but i would have him made sensible of the wrong he has done me revenge thus denied a vent recoils and preys upon the vitals of the person offended it displays itself in peevishness and bad humor which must work and ferment till time or acknowledgment of the wrong carry it off this sort of revenge is turned against the man himself who is offended and examples there are of persons in this pettish humor working great mischief to themselves in order to make the offenders sensible of the wrong thus nothing is more common than to find a young woman disappointed in love ready to throw herself away upon the first worthless fellow that will ask her the question this indeed is indulging the passion of revenge but without any concomitant pleasure or satisfaction far from it the greater the degree of indulgence the greater the pain my next instance will be still more satisfactory every one must have observed that when the passion of grief is at its height the very nature of it is to shun and fly from every thing which tends to give ease or comfort he rushes on to misery by a sort of sympathy with the person for whom he is grieved why should i be happy when my friend is no more is the language of this passion in these circumstances the man is truly a selftormentor and here we have a singular phoenomenon in human nature an appetite after pain an inclination to render ones self miserable this goes further than even selfmurder a crime that is never perpetrated but in order to put an end to misery when it rises to such an height as to be insupportable  we now see how imperfect the description is of human nature given by mr lock and by our french author they acknowledge no motive to action but what arises from selflove measures laid down to attain pleasure or to shun pain our particular appetites and affections and the desires and aversions involved in them are left entirely out of the system and yet we may say with some degree of probability that we are more influenced by these than by selflove we further discover by this inquiry what is of great importance to the subject in hand that as happiness is not always the impulsive motive to action so neither is it always the effect of an indulged passion nay we find this very singular phoenomenon in human nature a direct appetite or desire in some instances after pain so various is human nature and so complicated its acting powers that it is not readily to be taken in at one view  and now we return to our subject after having unfolded those principles of action with which it is connected it may be gathered from what is above laid down that nature which designed us for society has connected us strongly together by a participation of the joys and miseries of our fellow creatures we have a strong sympathy with them we partake of their afflictions we grieve with them and for them and in many instances their misfortunes affect us equally with our own let it not therefore appear surprising that people instead of shunning objects of misery choose to dwell upon them for this is truly as natural as indulging grief for our own misfortunes and it must be observed at the same time that this is wisely ordered by providence were the social affections mixed with any degree of aversion even when we suffer under them we should be inclined upon the first notice of an object of distress to drive it from our sight and mind instead of affording relief  nor ought we to judge of this principle as any way vicious or faulty for besides that it is the great cement of human society we ought to consider that as no state is exempt from misfortunes mutual sympathy must greatly promote the security and happiness of mankind and it is a much more comfortable situation that the prosperity and preservation of each individual should be the care of the whole species than that every man as the single inhabitant of a desert island should be left to stand or fall by himself without prospect of regard or assistance from others nor is this all when we consider our own character and actions in a reflex view we cannot help approving of this tenderness and sympathy in our nature we are pleased with ourselves for being so constituted we are conscious of inward merit and this is a continual source of satisfaction  to open this subject a little further it must be observed that naturally we have a strong desire to be acquainted with the history of our fellow creatures we judge of their actions approve or disapprove condemn or acquit and in this the busy mind has a wonderful delight nay we go further we enter deep into their concerns take a side we partake of joys and distresses with those we favor and show a proportional aversion to others this turn of mind makes history novels and plays the most universal and favorite entertainments and indeed this is no more than what is to be expected from man as a sociable creature and we may venture to affirm that the most sociable have the greatest share of this sort of curiosity and the strongest attachment to such entertainments  tragedy is an imitation or representation of human characters and actions it is a feigned history which generally makes a stronger impression than what is real because if it be a work of genius incidents will be chosen to make the deepest impressions and will be so conducted as to keep the mind in continual suspense and agitation beyond what commonly happens in real life by a well wrought tragedy all the social passions are roused the first scene is scarce ended before we are engaged we take a sudden affection to some of the personages represented we come to be attached to them as to our bosomfriends and hope and fear for them as if the whole were a true history instead of a fable  to a dry philosopher unacquainted with theatrical entertainments it may appear surprising that imitation should have such an effect upon the mind and that the want of truth and reality should not prevent the operation of our passions but whatever may be the physical cause one thing is evident that this aptitude of the mind of man to receive impressions from feigned as well as from real objects contributes to the noblest purposes of life nothing conduces so much to improve the mind and confirm it in virtue as being continually employed in surveying the actions of others entering into the concerns of the virtuous approving of their conduct condemning vice and showing an abhorrence at it for the mind acquires strength by exercise as well as the body but were there no opportunity for this sort of discipline but from scenes of real life the generality of men would be little the better for it because such scenes do but rarely occur they are not frequent even in history but in compositions where liberty is allowed of fiction it must be want of genius if the mind is not sufficiently exercised till it acquire the greatest sensibility and the most confirmed habits of virtue  thus tragedy engages our affections not less than true history friendship concern for the virtuous abhorrence of the vicious compassion hope fear and the whole train of the social passions are roused and exercised by both of them equally  this may appear to be a fair account of the attachment we have to theatrical entertainments but when the subject is more narrowly examined some difficulties occur to which the principles above laid down will scarce afford a satisfactory answer it is no wonder that young people flock to such entertainments the love of novelty desire of occupation beauty of action are strong attractions and if one is once engaged of whatever age by entering into the interests of the personages represented the attraction turns strong beyond measure and the story must be followed out whatever be the consequence the foresight of running ones self into grief and affliction will not disengage but people generally turn wise by experience and it may appear surprising when distress is the never failing effect of such entertainments that persons of riper judgment should not shun them altogether does selflove ly asleep in this case which is for ordinary so active a principle when one considers the matter a priori he will not hesitate to draw a conclusion to this purpose that as repeated experience must at the long run make us wise enough to keep out of harms way deep tragedies for that reason will be little frequented by persons of reflection yet the contrary is true in fact the deepest tragedies being the most frequented by persons of all ages especially by those of delicate feelings upon whom the strongest impressions are made a man of that character who has scarce got the better of the deep distress he was thrown into the night before by a well acted tragedy does in his closet coolly and deliberately resolve to go to the next entertainment of the kind without feeling the smallest obstruction from selflove  this leads to a speculation perhaps one of the most curious that belongs to human nature contrary to what is generally understood the above is a palpable proof that even selflove does not always operate to avoid pain and distress in examining how this is brought about there will be discovered an admirable contrivance in human nature to give free scope to the social affections let us review what is above laid down in the first place that of the painful passions some are accompanied with aversion some with desire in the next place that of the painful passions accompanied with desire the gratification of some produces pleasure such as hunger and thirst revenge etc others pain and distress such as grief now upon the strictest examination the following proposition will be found to hold true in fact that the painful passions which in the direct feeling are free from any degree of aversion have as little of it in the reflex act or to express the thing more familiarly when we reflect upon the pain we have suffered by our concern for others there is no degree of aversion mixed with the reflection more than with the pain itself which is the immediate effect of the object for illustrations sake let us compare the pain which arises from compassion with any bodily pain cutting ones flesh is not only accompanied with strong aversion in the direct feeling but with an aversion equally strong in reflecting upon the action afterward we feel no such aversion in reflecting upon the mental pains above described on the contrary when we reflect upon the pain which the misfortune of a friend gave us the reflection is accompanied with an eminent degree of satisfaction we approve of ourselves for suffering with our friend value ourselves the more for that suffering and are ready to undergo cheerfully the like distress upon the like occasion  when we examine those particular passions which though painful not only in the first impression but also in the gratification if i may call it so are yet accompanied with no aversion we find they are all of the social kind arising from that eminent principle of sympathy which is the cement of human society the social passions are accompanied with appetite for indulgence when they give us pain not less than when they give us pleasure we submit willingly to such painful passions and reckon it no hardship to suffer under them in this constitution we have the consciousness of regularity and order and that it is right and meet we should suffer after this manner thus the moral affections even such of them as produce pain both in the first feeling and in the indulgence of the passion are none of them attended with any degree of aversion not even in reflecting upon the distress they often bring us under and this observation tends to set the moral affections in a very distinguished point of view in opposition to those that are either malevolent or merely selfish  many and admirable are the springs of action in human nature and not one more admirable than what is now unfolded compassion is a most valuable principle which connects people in society by ties stronger than those of blood yet compassion is a painful emotion and is often accompanied with pain in the indulgence were it accompanied with any degree of aversion even in reflecting upon the distress it occasions after the distress is over that aversion would by degrees blunt the passion and at length cure us of what we would be apt to reckon a weakness or disease but the author of our nature has not left his work imperfect he has given us this noble principle entire without a counterbalance so as to have a vigorous and universal operation far from having any aversion to pain occasioned by the social principles we reflect upon such pain with satisfaction and are willing to submit to it upon all occasions with cheerfulness and heartliking just as much as if it were a real pleasure  and now the cause of the attachment we have to tragedy is fairly laid open and comes out in the strongest light the social passions put in motion by it are often the occasion of distress to the spectators but our nature is so happily constituted that distress occasioned by the exercise of the social passions is not an object of the smallest aversion to us even when we reflect coolly and deliberately upon it selflove does not carry us to shun affliction of this sort on the contrary we are so framed as willingly and cheerfully to submit to it upon all occasions as if it were a real and substantial good and thus tragedy is allowed to seize the mind with all the different charms which arise from the exercise of the social passions without the least obstacle from selflove  had our author reflected on the sympathising principle by which we are led as by a secret charm to partake of the miseries of others he would have had no occasion of recurring to so imperfect a principle as that of aversion to inaction to explain this seeming paradox that a man should voluntarily choose to give himself pain without entering deep into philosophy he might have had hints in abundance from common life to explain it in every corner persons are to be met with of such a sympathising temper as to choose to spend their lives with the diseased and distressed they partake with them in their afflictions enter heartily into their concerns and sigh and groan with them these pass their lives in sadness and despondency without having any other satisfaction than what arises upon the reflection of having done their duty  and if this account of the matter be just we may be assured that those who are most compassionate in their temper will be fondest of tragedy which affords them a large field for indulging the passion and indeed admirable are the effects brought about by this means for passions as they gather strength by indulgence so they decay by want of exercise persons in prosperity unacquainted with distress and misery are apt to grow hardhearted tragedy is an admirable resource in such a case it serves to humanize the temper by supplying feigned objects of pity which have nearly the same effect to exercise the passion that real objects have and thus it is that we are carried by a natural impulse to deal deep in affliction occasioned by representations of feigned misfortunes and the passion of pity alone would make us throng to such representations were there nothing else to attract the mind or to afford satisfaction  it is owing to curiosity that public executions are so much frequented sensible people endeavor to correct an appetite which upon indulgence gives pain and aversion and upon reflection is attended with no degree of selfapprobation hence it is that such spectacles are the entertainment of the vulgar chiefly who allow themselves blindly to be led by the present instinct with little attention whether it be conducive to their good or not  and as for prizefighting and gladiatorian shows nothing animates and inspires us more than examples of courage and bravery we catch the spirit of the actor and turn bold and intrepid as he appears to be on the other hand we enter into the distresses of the vanquished and have a sympathy for them in proportion to the gallantry of their behavior no wonder then that such shows are frequented by persons of the best taste we are led by the same principle that makes us fond of perusing the lives of heroes and of conquerors and it may be observed bytheby that such spectacles have an admirable good effect in training up the youth to boldness and resolution in this therefore i see not that foreigners have reason to condemn the english taste spectacles of this sort deserve encouragement from the state and to be made an object of public policy  as for gaming i cannot bring myself to think that there is any pleasure in having the mind kept in suspense and as it were upon the rack which must be the case of those who venture their money at games of hazard inaction and idleness are not by far so hard to bear i am satisfied that the love of money is at the bottom nor is it a solid objection that people will neglect games of skill and address to venture their money at hazard for this may be owing to indolence diffidence or impatience there is indeed a curious speculation with regard to this article of gaming that pleasure and pain attend good and bad success at play independent of the money lost or win it is a plain case that good luck raises our spirits as bad luck depresses them without regard to consequences and it seems extremely clear that our concern at game when we play for trifles is owing to this very thing what may be the root of this affection is not so obvious but as it is not necessarily connected with our present theme i shall leave it to be investigated by others  essay ii of the foundation and principles of the law of nature introduction superficial knowledge produces the boldest adventurers because it gives no check to the imagination when fired by a new thought writers of this stamp lay down plans contrive models and are hurried on to execution by the pleasure of novelty without considering whether after all there is any solid foundation to support the spacious edifice it redounds not a little to the honor of some late inquirers after truth that subduing this bent of nature they have submitted to the slow and more painful study of facts and experiments natural philosophy in all its branches is advanced by this laborious method the accurate mr lock has pursued the same track in the science of logicks and has been followed by several ingenious writers but it seems to fare hard with the mistressscience that less deference is paid to her than to her handmaids every author exhibits a system of morals such as best suits his taste and fancy he frames regulations for human conduct without considering whether they arise out of human nature or can be accommodated to it and hence many airy systems that relate not more to man than to many other beings authors of a warm imagination and benevolent turn of mind exalt man to the angelic nature and compose laws for his conduct so refined as to be far above the reach of humanity others of a contrary disposition forcing down all men to a level with the very lowest of their kind assign them laws more suitable to brutes than to rational beings in abstract science philosophers may more innocently indulge their fancies the worst that can happen is to mislead us in matters where error has little influence on practice but they who deal in moral philosophy ought to be cautious for their errors seldom fail to have a bad tendency the exalting of nature above its standard is apt to disgust the mind conscious of its weakness and of its inability to attain such an uncommon degree of perfection the debasing of nature tends to break the balance of the affections by adding weight to the selfish and irregular appetites a cruel effect this but not the only bad one the many clashing opinions about morality are apt to tempt readers who have any hollowness of heart to shake off all principles and to give way to every appetite as it comes uppermost and then adieu to a just tenor of life and consistency of conduct  these considerations give the author of this essay a just concern to proceed with the utmost circumspection in his inquiries and to try his conclusions by their true touchstone that of facts and experiments had this method been strictly followed the world would not have been perplexed with many various and inconsistent systems which unhappily have rendered morality a difficult and intricate science an attempt to restore it to its original simplicity and authority must be approved of however short one falls in the execution authors differ about the origin of the laws of nature and they differ about the laws themselves it will perhaps be found that there is less difference about the former in reality than in appearance it were to be wished that the different opinions about the latter could be as happily reconciled but as the author acknowledges this to be above his reach he must take up with a less agreeable task which is to attempt a plan of the laws of nature drawn from their proper source without regarding authority  chap i of the foundation of the law of nature in searching for the foundation of the laws of our nature the following reflections readily occur in the first place two things cannot be more intimately connected than a being and its actions for the connection is that of cause and effect such as the being is such must its actions be in the next place the several classes into which nature has distributed living creatures are not more distinguishable by an external form than by an internal constitution which manifests itself in a certain uniformity of conduct peculiar to each species in the third place any action conformable to the common nature of the species is considered by us as regular and good it is acting according to order and according to nature but if there exists a being with a constitution different from that of its kind the actions of this being though agreeable to its own peculiar constitution will to us appear whimsical and disorderly we shall have a feeling of disgust as if we saw a man with two heads or four hands these reflections lead us to the foundation of the laws of our nature they are to be derived from the common nature of man of which every person partakes who is not a monster  but as the above conclusion is the groundwork of all morality it may not be improper to bestow a few more words upon it looking around we find creatures of very different kinds both as to their external and internal constitutions each species having a peculiar nature must have a peculiar rule of action resulting from its nature we find this to hold in fact and it is extreme agreeable to observe how accurately the laws of each species arising from its nature are adjusted to its external frame and to the circumstances in which it is placed so as to procure the conveniences of life in the best manner and to produce regularity and consistency of conduct to give but one instance the laws which govern sociable creatures differ widely from those which govern the savage and solitary nothing more natural nor more orderly among solitary creatures who have no mutual connection than to make food one of another but for creatures in society to live after this manner behoved to be the effect of jarring and inconsistent principles no such disorderly appearance is to be met with upon the face of this globe there is as above observed a harmony betwixt the internal and external constitution of the several classes of animals and this harmony obtains so universally as to afford a delightful prospect of deep design regularly carried into execution the common nature of every class of beings is felt by us as perfect and therefore if in any instance a particular being swerve from the common nature of its kind the action upon that account is accompanied with a sense of disorder and wrong thus as we have a sense of right from every action which is conformable to this common nature the laws which ought to govern every animal are to be derived from no other source than the common nature of the species in a word it is according to order that the different sorts of living creatures should be governed by laws adapted to their peculiar nature we consider it as fit and proper that it should be so and it is a beautiful scene to find creatures acting according to their nature and thereby acting uniformly and according to a just tenor of life  the force of this reasoning cannot at any rate be resisted by those who admit of final causes we make no difficulty to pronounce that a species of beings are made for such and such an end who are of such and such a nature a lion is made to purchase the means of life by his claws why because such is his nature and constitution a man is made to purchase the means of life by the help of others in society why because from the constitution both of his body and mind he cannot live comfortably but in society it is thus we discover for what end we were designed by nature or the author of nature and the same chain of reasoning points out to us the laws by which we ought to regulate our actions for acting according to nature is acting so as to answer the end of our creation  chap ii of the moral sense having shown that the nature of man is the only foundation of the laws that ought to govern his actions it will be necessary to trace out human nature with all the accuracy possible so far as regards the present subject if we can happily accomplish this undertaking it will be easy in the synthetical method to deduce the laws which ought to regulate our conduct and we shall examine in the first place after what manner we are related to beings and things about us for this speculation will lead to the point in view  as we are placed in a great world surrounded with beings and things some beneficial others hurtful we are so constituted that scarce any of the objects of perception are indifferent to us they either give us pleasure or pain sounds tastes and smells are either agreeable or disagreeable and the thing is most of all remarkable is the objects of sight which affect us in a more lively manner than the objects of any other external sense thus a spreading oak a verdant plain a large river are objects which afford great delight a rotten carcass a distorted figure create aversion which in some instances goes the length of horror  with regard to objects of sight whatever gives pleasure is said to be beautiful whatever gives pain is said to be ugly the terms beauty and ugliness in their original signification are confined to objects of sight and indeed such objects being more highly agreeable or disagreeable than others deserve well to be distinguished by a proper name but though this is the proper meaning of the terms beauty and ugliness yet as it happens with words which convey a more lively idea than ordinary the terms are applied in a figurative sense to almost every thing which carries a high relish or disgust though not the object of sight where these feelings have not a proper name of their own thus we talk of a beautiful theorem a beautiful thought and a beautiful action and this way of speaking has by common use become so familiar that it is scarce reckoned a figurative expression  the pleasure and pain which arise from objects considered simply as existing without relation to any end proposed or any designing agent are to be placed in the lowest rank or order of beauty and ugliness but when external objects such as works of art are considered with relation to some end proposed we feel a higher degree of pleasure or pain thus a building regular in all its parts pleases the eye upon the very first view but considered as a house for dwelling in which is the end proposed it pleases still more supposing it to be well fitted to its end a similar sensation arises in observing the operations of a well ordered state where the parts are nicely adjusted to the ends of security and happiness  this perception of beauty in works of art or design which is produced not barely by a sight of the object but by viewing the object in a certain light as fitted to some use and as related to some end includes in it what is termed approbation for approbation when applied to works of art means precisely our being pleased with them or conceiving them beautiful in the view of being fitted to their end approbation and disapprobation do not apply to the first or lowest class of beautiful and ugly objects to say that we approve of a sweet taste or of a flowing river is really saying no more than barely that we are pleased with such objects but the term is justly applied to works of art because it means more than being pleased with such an object merely as existing it imports a peculiar beauty which is perceived upon considering the object as fitted to the use intended  it must be further observed to avoid obscurity that the beauty which arises from the relation of an object to its end is independent of the end itself whether good or bad whether beneficial or hurtful for the feeling arises merely from considering its fitness to the end proposed whatever that end be  when we take the end itself under consideration there is discovered a distinct modification of beauty and ugliness of a higher kind than the two former a beneficial end proposed strikes us with a very peculiar pleasure and approbation belongs also to this feeling thus the mechanism of a ship is beautiful in the view of means well fitted to an end but the end itself of carrying on commerce and procuring so many conveniences to mankind exalts the object and heightens our approbation and pleasure by an end i mean that to which any thing is fitted which it serves to procure and bring about whether it be an ultimate end or subordinate to something further hence what is considered as an end in one view may be considered as a means in another but so far as it is considered as an end the degree of its beauty depends upon the degree of its usefulness the feeling of approbation here terminates upon the thing itself in many instances abstracted from the intention of an agent which intention coming into view as good or bad gives rise to a modification of beauty or deformity different from those above set forth as shall be presently explained let it be only kept in view that as the end or use of a thing is an object of greater dignity and importance than the means the approbation bestowed on the former rises higher than that bestowed on the latter  these three orders of beauty may be blended together in many different ways to have very different effects if an object in itself beautiful be ill fitted to its end it will upon the whole be disagreeable this may be exemplified in a house regular in its architecture and beautiful to the eye but incommodious for dwelling if there is in an object an aptitude to a bad end it will upon the whole be disagreeable though it have the second modification of beauty in the greatest perfection a constitution of government formed with the most perfect art for enslaving the people may be an instance of this if the end proposed is good but the object not well fitted to the end it will be beautiful or ugly as the goodness of the end or unfitness of the means are prevalent of this instances will occur at first view without being suggested  the above modifications of beauty and deformity apply to all objects animate and inanimate a voluntary agent is an object which produces a peculiar modification of beauty and deformity which may readily be distinguished in the feeling from all others the actions of living creatures are more interesting than the actions of matter the instincts and principles of action of the former give us more delight than the blind powers of the latter or in other words are more beautiful no one can doubt of this fact who is in any degree conversant with the poets in homer every thing lives even darts and arrows are endued with voluntary motion and we are sensible that nothing animates a poem more than the frequent use of this figure  and hence a new modification of the beauty and deformity of actions considered as proceeding from intention deliberation and choice this modification which is of the utmost importance in the science of morals concerns principally human actions for we discover little of intention deliberation and choice in the actions of inferior creatures human actions are not only agreeable or disagreeable beautiful or deformed in the different views above mentioned but are further distinguished in our feeling as fit right and meet to be done or as unfit unmeet and wrong to be done these are simple feelings capable of no definition and which cannot otherways be explained than by making use of the words that are appropriated to them but let any man attentively examine what passes in his mind when the object of his thought is an action proceeding from deliberate intention and he will soon discover the meaning of these words and the feelings which they denote let him but attend to a deliberate action suggested by filial piety or one suggested by gratitude such actions will not only be agreeable to him and appear beautiful but will be agreeable and beautiful as fit right and meet to be done he will approve of the action in that quality and he will approve of the actor for having done his duty this peculiar feeling or modification of beauty and deformity in human actions is known by the name of moral beauty and moral deformity in it consists the morality and immorality of human actions and the power or faculty by which we perceive this difference among actions passes under the name of the moral sense  it is but a superficial account which is given of morality by most writers that it depends upon approbation and disapprobation for it is evident that these terms are applicable to works of art and to objects beneficial and hurtful as well as to morality it ought further to have been observed that the approbation or disapprobation of actions are feelings very distinguishable from what relate to the objects now mentioned some actions are approved of as good and as fit right and meet to be done others are disapproved of as bad and unfit unmeet and wrong to be done in the one case we approve of the actor as a good man in the other disapprove of him as a bad man these feelings dont apply to objects as fitted to an end nor even to the end itself except as proceeding from deliberate intention when a piece of work is well executed we approve of the artificer for his skill not for his goodness several things inanimate as well as animate serve to extreme good ends we approve of these ends as useful in themselves but not as morally fit and right where they are not considered as the result of intention  of all objects whatever human actions are the most highly delightful or disgustful and afford the greatest degree of beauty or deformity in these every modification concurs the fitness or unfitness of the means the goodness or badness of the end the intention of the actor which gives them the peculiar character of fit right and meet or unfit wrong and unmeet  thus we find the nature of man so constituted as to approve of certain actions and to disapprove of others to consider some actions as fit right and meet to be done and to consider others as unfit unmeet and wrong what distinguishes actions to make them objects of the one or other feeling will be explained in the following chapter and perhaps it will further appear with regard to some of our actions that the approbation or disapprobation bestowed has a more peculiar modification than has been hitherto observed to be a foundation for the well known terms of duty and obligation and consequently for a rule of conduct which in the strictest sense may be termed a law but at present it is sufficient to have explained in general that we are so constituted as to perceive or feel a beauty and deformity and a right and wrong in actions and this is what strongly characterises the laws which govern the actions of mankind with regard to all other beings we have no data to discover the laws of their nature other than their frame and constitution we have the same data to discover the laws of our own nature and we have over and above a peculiar feeling of approbation or disapprobation to point out to us what we ought to do and what we ought not to do and one thing is extremely remarkable which will be explained afterward that the laws which are fitted to the nature of man and to his external circumstances are the same which we approve of by the moral sense  chap iii of duty and obligation though these terms are of the utmost importance in morals i know not that any author has attempted to explain them by pointing out those principles or feelings which they express this defect i shall endeavor to supply by tracing these terms to their proper source without which the system of morals cannot be complete because they point out to us the most precise and essential branch of morality  lord shaftesbury to whom the world is much indebted for his inestimable writings has clearly and convincingly made out that virtue is the good and vice the ill of every one but he has not proved virtue to be our duty otherways than by showing it to be our interest which does not come up to the idea of duty for this term plainly implies somewhat indispensible in our conduct what we ought to do what we ought to submit to now a man may be considered as foolish for acting against his interest but he cannot be considered as wicked or vicious his lordship indeed in his essay upon virtue page     points at an explanation of duty and obligation by asserting the subordinacy of the selfaffections to the social but though he states this as a proposition to be made out he drops it in the after part of his work and never again brings it into view  mr hutchison in his essay upon beauty and virtue page  0   founds the morality of actions on a certain quality of actions which procures approbation and love to the agent but this account of morality is imperfect because it excludes justice and every thing which may be strictly called duty the man who confining himself to strict duty is true to his word and avoids harming others is a just and moral man is entitled to some share of esteem but will never be the object of love or friendship he must show a disposition to the good of mankind at least of his friends and neighbors he must exert acts of humanity and benevolence before he can hope to procure the affection of others  but it is principally to be observed that in this account of morality the terms right obligation duty ought and should have no distinct meaning which shows that the entire foundation of morality is not taken in by this author it is true that toward the close of his work he endeavors to explain the meaning of the term obligation but as criticizing upon authors those especially who have laid themselves out to advance the cause of virtue is not the most agreeable task i would not choose to spend time in showing that he is unsuccessful in his attempt the slightest attention to the subject will make it evident for his whole account of obligation is no more than either a motive from selfinterest sufficient to determine all those who duly consider it to a certain course of action which surely is not moral obligation a determination without regard to our own interest to approve actions and to perform them which determination shall also make us displeased with ourselves and uneasy upon having acted contrary to it in which sense he says there is naturally an obligation upon all men to benevolence but this account falls far short of the whole idea of obligation and leaves no distinction betwixt it and a simple approbation or disapprobation of the moral sense feelings that attend many actions which by no means come under the notion of obligation or duty  neither is the author of the treatise upon human nature more successful when he endeavors to resolve the moral sense into pure sympathy vol   part    according to this author there is no more in morality but approving or disapproving of an action after we discover by reflection that it tends to the good or hurt of society this would be by far too faint a principle to control our irregular appetites and passions it would scarce be sufficient to restrain us from encroaching upon our friends and neighbors and with regard to strangers would be the weakest of all restraints we shall by and by show that morality has a more solid foundation in the mean time it is of importance to observe that upon this authors system as well as hutchisons the noted terms of duty obligation ought and should etc are perfectly unintelligible  we shall now proceed to explain these terms by pointing out the precise feelings which they express and in performing this task there will be discovered a wonderful and beautiful contrivance of the author of our nature to give authority to morality by putting the selfaffections in a due subordination to the social the moral sense has in part been explained above that by it we perceive some actions under the modification of being fit right and meet to be done and others under the modification of being unfit unmeet and wrong when this observation is applied to particulars it is an evident fact that we have a sense of fitness in kindly and beneficent actions we approve of ourselves and others for performing actions of this kind as on the other hand we disapprove of the unsociable peevish and hardhearted but with regard to one set of actions there is a further modification of the moral sense actions directed against others by which they are hurt or prejudged in their persons in their fame or in their goods are the objects of a peculiar feeling they are perceived and felt not only as unfit to be done but as absolutely wrong to be done and what at any rate we ought not to do what is here asserted is a matter of fact which can admit of no other proof than an appeal to every mans own feelings lay prejudice aside and give fair play to the emotions of the heart i ask no other concession there is no man however irregular in his life and manners however poisoned by a wrong education but must be sensible of this fact and indeed the words which are to be found in all languages and which are perfectly understood in the communication of sentiments are an evident demonstration of it duty obligation ought and should in their common meaning would be empty sounds unless upon supposition of such a feeling  the case is the same with regard to gratitude to benefactors and performing of engagements we feel these as our duty in the strictest sense and as what we are indispensibly obliged to we dont consider them as in any measure under our own power we have the feeling of necessity and of being bound and tied to performance almost equally as if we were under some external compulsion  it is fit here to be remarked that benevolent and generous actions are not the object of this peculiar feeling hence such actions though considered as fit and right to be done are not however considered to be our duty but as virtuous actions beyond what is strictly our duty benevolence and generosity are more beautiful and more attractive of love and esteem than justice yet not being so necessary to the support of society they are left upon the general footing of approbatory pleasure while justice faith truth without which society could not at all subsist are the objects of the above peculiar feeling to take away all shadow of liberty and to put us under a necessity of performance  doctor butler a manly and acute writer has gone further than any other to assign a just foundation for moral duty he considers preface to the latter editions of his sermons conscience or reflection as one principle of action which compared with the rest as they stand together in the nature of man plainly bears upon it marks of authority over all the rest and claims the absolute direction of them all to allow or forbid their gratification and his proof of this proposition is that a disapprobation of reflection is in itself a principle manifestly superior to a mere propension had this admirable author handled the subject more professedly than he had occasion to do in a preface it is more than likely he would have brought it out into its clearest light but he has not said enough to afford that light which the subject is capable of for it may be observed in the first place that a disapprobation of reflection is far from being the whole of the matter such disapprobation is applied to moroseness selfishness and many other partial affections which are however not considered in a strict sense as contrary to our duty and it may be doubted whether a disapprobation of reflection is in every case a principle superior to a mere propension we disapprove of a man who neglects his private affairs and gives himself up to love hunting or any other amusement nay he disapproves of himself yet from this we cannot fairly conclude that he is guilty of any breach of duty or that it is unlawful for him to follow his propension we may observe in the next place what will be afterward explained that conscience or the moral sense is none of our principles of action but their guide and director it is still of greater importance to observe that the authority of conscience does not merely consist in an act of reflection it proceeds from a direct feeling which we have upon presenting the object without the intervention of any sort of reflection and the authority lies in this circumstance that we feel and perceive the action to be our duty and what we are indispensibly bound to perform it is in this manner that the moral sense with regard to some actions plainly bears upon it the marks of authority over all our appetites and affections it is the voice of god within us which commands our strictest obedience just as much as when his will is declared by express revelation  what is above laid down is an analysis of the moral sense but not the whole of it a very important branch still remains to be unfolded and indeed the more we search into the works of nature the more opportunity there is to admire the wisdom and goodness of the sovereign architect in the matters above mentioned performing of promises gratitude and abstaining from harming others we have not only the peculiar feeling and sense of duty and obligation in transgressing these duties we have not only the feeling of vice and wickedness but we have further the sense of merited punishment and dread of its being inflicted upon us this dread may be but slight in the more venial transgressions but in crimes of a deep dye it rises to a degree of anguish and despair hence that remorse of conscience which histories are full of upon the commission of certain crimes and which proves the most severe of all tortures this dread of merited punishment operates for the most part so strongly upon the imagination that every unusual accident every extraordinary misfortune is considered as a punishment purposely inflicted for the crime committed while the guilty person is in prosperity he makes a shift to blunt the stings of his conscience but no sooner does he fall into distress or into any depression of mind than his conscience lays fast hold of him his crime stares him in the face and every accidental misfortune is converted into a real punishment and they said one to another we are verily guilty concerning our brother in that we saw the anguish of his soul when he besought us and we would not hear therefore is this distress come upon us and reuben answered them saying spoke i not unto you saying do not sin against the child and you would not hear therefore behold also his blood is required genesis chap xlii ver         one material circumstance is here to be remarked which makes a further difference betwixt the primary and secondary virtues as justice and the other primary virtues are more essential to society than generosity benevolence or any other secondary virtue they are likeways more universal friendship generosity softness of manners form particular characters and serve to distinguish one man from another but the sense of justice and of the other primary virtues is universal it belongs to man as such though it exists in very different degrees of strength there perhaps never was a human creature absolutely void of it and it makes a delightful appearance in the human constitution that even where this sense is weak as it is in some individuals it notwithstanding retains its authority as the director of their conduct if there is any sense of justice or of abstaining from injury it must distinguish right from wrong what we ought to do from what we ought not to do and by that very distinguishing feeling justly claims to be our guide and governor this consideration may serve to justify human laws which make no distinction among men as endued with a stronger or weaker sense of morality  and here we must pause a moment to indulge some degree of admiration upon this part of the human system man is evidently intended to live in society and because there can be no society among creatures who prey upon one another it was necessary in the first place to provide against mutual injuries further man is the weakest of all creatures separately and the very strongest in society therefore mutual assistance is the principal end of society and to this end it was necessary that there should be mutual trust and reliance upon engagements and that favors received should be thankfully repaid now nothing can be more finely adjusted than the human heart to answer these purposes it is not sufficient that we approve of every action which is essential to the preservation of society it is not sufficient that we disapprove of every action which tends to its dissolution a simple sense of approbation or disapprobation will scarce be sufficient to give these actions the sanction of a law but the approbation in this case has the peculiar feeling of duty that these actions are what we ought to perform and what we are indispensibly bound to perform this circumstance converts into a law what without it can only be considered as a rational measure and a prudential rule of action nor is any thing omitted to give it the most complete character of a law the transgression is attended with apprehension of punishment nay with actual punishment as every misfortune which befalls the transgressor is considered by him as a punishment nor is this the whole of the matter sympathy with our fellow creatures is a principle implanted in the breast of every man we cannot hurt another without suffering for it which is an additional punishment and we are still further punished for our injustice or ingratitude by incurring thereby the aversion and hatred of mankind  chap iv of the different orders of moral beauty it is a fact which will be universally admitted that no man thinks so highly of himself or of another for having done a just as for having done a generous action yet every one must be sensible that justice is more essential than generosity to the order and preservation of society and why we should place the greater merit upon the less essential action may appear unaccountable this matter deserves to be examined because it gives a further opening to the science of morals  upon a small degree of reflection it will appear that the whole system of morals is founded upon the supposition of liberty of action doctor butler preface to his sermons page    says our constitution is put into our own power we are charged with it and therefore are accountable for any disorder or violation of it  if actions were understood to be necessary and no way under our power or control we could never conceive them as fit or unfit to be done as what we are indispensibly bound to do or not to do to have such a feeling of human actions upon the supposition of necessity would be as inconsistent as to have such a feeling of the actions of matter the celebrated dispute about liberty and necessity is reserved to be discussed in a following essay but without entering upon that subject at present one fact is certain that in acting we have a feeling of liberty and independency we never do a wrong however strong the motive be which is not attended with a severe reflection that we might have done otherways and ought to have done otherways nay during the very action in the very time of it we have a sense or feeling of wrong and that we ought to forbear so that the moral sense both in the direct feeling and in the act of reflection plainly supposes and implies liberty of action  this if we mistake not will clear the difficulty above stated if in the moral sense be involved liberty of action there must of consequence be the highest sense or feeling of morality where liberty is greatest now in judging of human actions those actions which are essential to the order and preservation of society are considered to be in a good measure necessary it is our strict duty to be just and honest we are bound by a law in our nature which we ought not to transgress no such feeling of duty or obligation attends those actions which come under the denomination of generosity greatness of mind heroism justice therefore is considered as less free than generosity and upon that very account we ascribe less merit to the former than to the latter we ascribe no merit at all to an action which is altogether involuntary and we ascribe more or less merit in proportion as the action is more or less voluntary  thus there is discovered two ranks or classes of moral actions which are different in their nature and different as to the laws by which they are enforced those of the first rank being essential to the subsistence of society are entirely withdrawn from our election and choice they are perceived as indispensibly obligatory upon us and the transgression of the laws which regulate this branch of our conduct is attended with severe and neverfailing punishment in a word there is not a characteristic of positive law which is not applicable in the strictest sense to these laws of nature with this material difference that the sanctions of these laws are greatly more efficacious than any have been that invented to enforce municipal laws those of the second rank which contribute to the improvement of society but are not strictly necessary to its subsistence are left to our own choice they have not the character of moral necessity impressed upon them nor is the forbearance of them attended with the feeling of guilt on the other hand the actions which belong to this rank are the objects of the strongest feelings of moral beauty of the highest degree of approbation both from ourselves and others offices of undeserved kindness requital of good for evil generous toils and sufferings for the good of our country come under this class these are not made our duty there is no motive to the performance which in any proper sense can be called a law but there are the strongest motives that can consist with perfect freedom the performance is rewarded with a consciousness of selfmerit and with the praise and admiration of all the world which are the highest and most refined pleasures that human nature is susceptible of  there is so much of enthusiasm in this branch of moral beauty that it is not wonderful to find persons of a free and generous turn of mind captivated with it who are less attentive to the virtues of the first class the magnanimous who cannot bear restraint are more guided by generosity than justice yet as pain is a stronger motive to action than pleasure the remorse which attends a breach of strict duty is with the bulk of mankind a more powerful incitement to honesty than praise and selfapprobation are to generosity and there cannot be a more pregnant instance of wisdom than this part of the human constitution it being far more essential to society that all men be just and honest than that they be patriots and heroes  the sum of what is above laid down is that with regard to actions of the first rank the pain of transgressing the law is much greater than the pleasure which results from obeying it the contrary is the case of actions of the second rank the pleasure arising from the performance is much greater than the pain of neglect among the vices opposite to the primary virtues the most striking appearances of moral deformity are found among the secondary virtues the most striking appearances of moral beauty  chap v of the principles of action in the three foregoing chapters we have taken some pains to inquire into the moral sense and to annalise it into its different feelings our present task must be to inquire into those principles in our nature which move us to action these are different subjects for the moral sense properly speaking is not a principle which moves us to action its province is to instruct us which of our principles of action we may indulge and which of them we must restrain it is the voice of god within us informing us of our duty  in a treatise upon the law of nature it is of great importance to trace out the principles by which we are led to action we have above observed that the laws of nature can be no other than rules of action adapted to our nature now our nature so far as concerns action is made up of appetites passions and affections which are the principles of action and of the moral sense by which these principles are governed and directed no action therefore is a duty to the performance of which we are not prompted by some natural principle to make such an action our duty would be to lay down a rule of conduct contrary to our nature or that has no foundation in our nature conscience or the moral sense may restrain us from actions to which we are incited by a natural principle but conscience or the moral sense is not in any case the sole principle or motive of action nature has assigned it a different province this is a truth which has been little attended to by those who have given us systems of natural laws no wonder therefore they have wandered so far from truth let it be kept close in view and it will put an end to many a controversy about these laws for example if it be laid down as a primary law of nature that we are strictly bound to advance the good of all regarding our own interest no further than as it makes a part of the general happiness we may safely reject such a law as inconsistent with our nature unless it be made appear that there is a principle of benevolence in man which prompts him to an equal pursuit of the happiness of all to found this disinterested scheme wholly upon the moral sense would be a fruitless endeavor the moral sense as above observed is our guide only not our mover approbation or disapprobation of these actions to which by some natural principle we are antecedently directed is all that can result from it if it be laid down on the other hand that we ought only to regard ourselves in all our actions and that it is folly if not vice to concern ourselves for others such a law can never be admitted unless upon the supposition that selflove is our only principle of action  it is probable that in the following particular man differs from the brute creation brutes are entirely governed by principles of action which in them obtain the name of instincts they blindly follow their instincts and are led by that instinct which is strongest for the time it is meet and fit they should act after this manner because it is acting according to the whole of their nature but for man to allow himself to be led implicitly by instinct or his principles of action without check or control is not acting according to the whole of his nature he is endued with a moral sense or conscience to check and control his principles of action and to instruct him which of them he may indulge and which of them he ought to restrain this account of the brute creation is undoubtedly true in the main whether so in every particular is of no importance to the present subject being only suggested by way of contrast to illustrate the peculiar nature of man  afull account of our principles of action would be an endless theme but as it is proposed to confine the present short essay to the laws which govern social life we shall have no occasion to inquire into any principles of action but what are directed upon others dropping these which have self alone for their object and in this inquiry we set out with a most important question seiz in what sense we are to hold a principle of universal benevolence as belonging to human nature when we consider a single man abstracted from all circumstances and all connections we are not conscious of any benevolence to him we feel nothing within us that prompts us to advance his happiness if one is agreeable at first sight and attracts any degree of affection it is owing to looks manner or behavior and for evidence of this we are as apt to be disgusted at first sight as to be pleased man is by nature a shy and timorous animal every new object gives an impression of fear till upon better acquaintance it is discovered to be harmless thus an infant clings to its nurse upon the sight of a new face and this natural dread is not removed but by long experience if every human creature did produce affection in every other at first sight children by natural instinct would be fond of strangers but no such instinct discovers itself fondness is confined to the nurse the parents and those who are most about the child till by degrees it opens to a sense of larger connections this argument may be illustrated by a very low but very apt instance dogs have by nature an affection for the human species and upon this account puppies run to the first man they see show marks of fondness and play about his feet there is no such general fondness of man to man by nature particular circumstances are always required to produce and call it forth distress indeed never fails to beget sympathy the misery of the most unknown is a painful object and we are prompted by nature to afford relief but when there is nothing to call forth our sympathy where there are no peculiar circumstances to interest us or beget a connection we rest in a state of indifference and are not conscious of wishing either good or ill to the person those moralists therefore who require us to lay aside all partial affection and to act upon a principle of general equal benevolence to all men require us to act upon a principle which in truth has no place in our nature  notwithstanding of this it may be justly said that man is endued with a principle of universal benevolence for the happiness of mankind is an object agreeable to the mind in contemplation and good men have a sensible pleasure in every study or pursuit by which they can promote it it must indeed be acknowledged that benevolence is not equally directed to all men but gradually decreases according to the distance of the object till it dwindle away to nothing but here comes in a happy contrivance of nature to supply the want of benevolence toward distant objects which is to give power to an abstract term such as our religion our country our government or even mankind to raise benevolence or public spirit in the mind the particular objects under each of these classes considered singly and apart may have little or no force to produce affection but when comprehended under one general term they become an object that dilates and warms the heart and in this way man is enabled to embrace in his affection all mankind and thereby prompted to public spirited actions  he must have a great share of indifference in his temper who can reflect upon this branch of human nature without some degree of emotion there is perhaps not one scene to be met with in the natural or moral world where more of design and of consummate wisdom are displayed than in this under consideration the authors who impressed with reverence for human nature have endeavored to exalt it to the highest pitch could none of them stretch their imagination beyond a principle of equal and universal benevolence and a very fine scheme it is in idea but unluckily it is entirely of the utopian kind altogether unfit for life and action it has escaped the consideration of these authors that man is by nature of a limited capacity and that his affection by multiplication of objects instead of being increased is split into parts and weakened by division a principle of universal equal benevolence by dividing the attention and affection instead of promoting benevolent actions would in reality be an obstruction to them the mind would be distracted by the multiplicity of objects that have an equal influence so as to be eternally at a loss where to set out but the human system is better adjusted than to admit of such disproportion betwixt ability and affection the principal objects of mans love are his friends and relations he has to spare for his neighbors his affection lessens gradually in proportion to the distance of the object till it vanish altogether but were this the whole of human nature with regard to benevolence man would be but an abject creature by a very happy contrivance objects which because of their distance have little or no influence are made by accumulation and by being gathered together in one general view to have the very strongest effect exceeding in many instances the most lively affection that is bestowed upon particular objects by this happy contrivance the attention of the mind and its affections are preserved entire to be bestowed upon general objects instead of being dissipated by an endless division nothing more ennobles human nature than this principle or spring of action and at the same time nothing is more wonderful than that a general term to which a very faint if any idea is affixt should be the foundation of a more intense affection than is bestowed for the most part upon particular objects how attractive soever when we talk of our country our religion our government the ideas annexed to these general terms are at best obscure and indistinct general terms are extremely useful in language serving like mathematical signs to communicate our thoughts in a summary way but the use of them is not confined to language they serve for a much nobler purpose to excite us to generous and benevolent actions of the most exalted kind not confined to particulars but grasping whole societies towns countries kingdoms nay all mankind by this curious mechanism the defect of our nature is amply remedied distant objects otherways insensible are rendered conspicuous accumulation makes them great and greatness brings them near the eye the affection is preserved to be bestowed entire as upon a single object and to say all in one word this system of benevolence which is really founded in human nature and not the invention of man is infinitely better contrived to advance the good and happiness of mankind than any utopian system that ever has been produced by the warmest imagination  upon the opposite system of absolute selfishness there is no occasion to lose a moment it is evidently chimerical because it has no foundation in human nature it is not more certain that there exists the creature man than that he has principles of action directed entirely upon others some to do them good and others to do them mischief who can doubt of this when friendship compassion gratitude on the one hand and on the other malice and resentment are considered it has indeed been observed that we indulge such passions and affections merely for our own gratification but no person can relish this observation who is in any measure acquainted with human nature the social affections are in fact the source of the deepest afflictions as well as of the most exalted pleasures as has been fully laid open in the foregoing essay in a word we are evidently formed by nature for society and for indulging the social as well as the selfish passions and therefore to contend that we ought only to regard ourselves and to be influenced by no principles but what are selfish is directly to fly in the face of nature and to lay down a rule of conduct inconsistent with our nature  these systems being laid aside as widely erring from the nature of man the way lies open to come at what are his true and genuine principles of action the first thing that nature consults is the preservation of her creatures hence the love of life is made the strongest of all instincts upon the same foundation pain is in a greater degree the object of aversion than pleasure is of desire pain warns us of what tends to our dissolution and so is a strong guard to selfpreservation pleasure is often sought after unwarily and by means dangerous to health and life pain comes in as a monitor of our danger and nature consulting our preservation in the first place and our gratification only in the second wisely gives pain more force to draw us back than it gives pleasure to push us forward  the second principle of action is selflove or desire of our own happiness and good this is a stronger principle than benevolence or love bestowed upon others and in that respect is wisely ordered because every man has more power knowledge and opportunity to promote his own good than that of others thus the good of individuals is principally trusted to their own care it is agreeable to the limited nature of such a creature as man that it should be so and consequently it is wisely ordered that every man should have the strongest affection for himself  the above principles have self for their object the following regard others fidelity is undoubtedly a principle of action not of the weakest sort performance of promises the standing true to engagements and in general the executing of trusts come under this head therefore friendship belongs to this principle which supposes a mutual engagement and also love to children who by nature are entrusted to our care  gratitude is a fourth principle of action universally acknowledged and benevolence possesses the last place diversified by its objects and exerting itself more vigorously or more faintly in proportion to the distance of particular objects and the grandeur of those that are general this principle of action has one remarkable modification that it operates with much greater force to relieve those in distress than to promote positive good in the case of distress sympathy comes to its aid and in that circumstance it acquires the name of compassion  these several principles of action are ordered with admirable wisdom to promote the general good in the best and most effectual manner we act for the general good when we act upon these principles even when it is not our immediate aim the general good is an object too sublime and too remote to be the sole impulsive motive to action it is better ordered that in most instances individuals should have a limited aim which they can readily accomplish to every man is assigned his own task and if every man do his duty the general good will be promoted much more successfully than if it were the aim in every single action  the above mentioned principles of action belong to man as such and constitute what may be called the common nature of man many other principles exert themselves upon particular objects in the instinctive manner without the intervention of any sort of reasoning or reflection which also belong to man as such appetite for food lust etc other particular appetites passions and affections such as ambition avarice envy love of novelty of grandeur etc constitute the peculiar nature of individuals because these are diversified among individuals in very different degrees it belongs to the science of ethics to treat of these particular principles of action all that needs here be observed of them is that it is the aim of the general principle of selflove to obtain gratification to these particular principles  chap vi of the source of the laws of nature according to some authors having thus at full length explained the nature of man so far as concerns the present subject it may not be disagreeable to the reader to have some relaxation before he enters upon the remaining part of the work we shall fill up this interval with a view of some opinions about the foundation of the laws of nature which we cannot help judging to be inaccurate if not erroneous the episode is at the same time strictly connected with the principal subject because truth is always best illustrated by opposing it to error that morality depends entirely on the will of god and that his will creates the only obligation we ly under to be virtuous is the opinion of several writers this opinion in one sense is true but far from being true in their sense who inculcate it and true or false it does not advance us a single step in the knowledge of our duty for what does it avail to know that morality depends upon the will of god till we once know what his will is if it be said there is an original revelation of it to us in our nature this can only mean that our nature itself makes us feel the distinction betwixt virtue and vice which is the very doctrine above laid down but say they god from the purity and rectitude of his nature cannot but approve of good actions and disapprove of such as are otherways here they dont consider that this argument supposes a distinction betwixt virtue and vice antecedent to the will of god for if abstracting from his will virtue and vice were indifferent which is supposed in the proposition we have no data from the purity of gods nature or from any other principle to conclude that virtue is more the object of his choice than vice but further the very supposition of the purity and rectitude of the nature of the divine being presupposes a taste feeling or knowledge in us of an essential difference betwixt virtue and vice therefore it can never be said in any proper sense that our only obligation to virtue is the will of god seeing it is true that abstracting altogether from his will there is an obligation to virtue founded in the very frame of our nature  in one sense indeed it is true that morality depends upon the will of god who made us such as we are with a moral sense to distinguish virtue from vice but this is saying no more but that it is gods will or that it is agreeable to him we should be virtuous it is another thing to maintain that man is indifferent to virtue and vice and that he is under no obligation to the one more than to the other unless so far as he is determined by the arbitrary will of a superior or sovereign that a being may be so framed as to answer this description may be yielded but taking man as he is endued with a moral sense it is a direct contradiction to hold that he is under no obligation to virtue other than the mere will of god in this sense morality no more depends upon the will of god than upon our own will  we shall next take a view of a doctrine which may be set in opposition to the foregoing and that is dr clarkes demonstration of the unalterable obligation of moral duty his proposition is that from the eternal and necessary differences of things there naturally and necessarily arise certain moral obligations which are of themselves incumbent on all rational creatures antecedent to all positive institution and to all expectation of reward or punishment and this proposition he demonstrates in the following manner that there is a fitness of certain circumstances to certain persons and an unfitness of others antecedent to positive laws and that from the different relations of different things there arises a fitness and unfitness of certain behavior of some persons for instance god is superior to man and therefore it is fit that man should worship him  if this demonstration as it is called be the only or principal foundation of morals unlucky it is that a doctrine of such importance should have so long been hid from the public the ancients however carried the obligation of morals perhaps as far as this eminent divine does and now that the important discovery is made it is not likely to do great service considering how little the bulk of mankind are able to enter into abstruse reasoning and how little influence such reasoning generally has after it is apprehended  but abstruseness is not the only imperfection of this celebrated argument it appears to me altogether inconclusive laying aside perception and feeling upon which the doctor founds no part of his demonstration i should be utterly at a loss from any given relation betwixt persons to draw a conclusion of the fitness or unfitness of a certain course of behavior god is our superior and therefore it is fit we should worship him but here i put the question upon what principle of reason does this conclusion rest where is the connecting proposition by means of which the inference is drawn here the doctor must be utterly at a loss for the truth of the matter is that the terms fitness and unfitness in their present signification depend entirely upon the moral sense fitness and unfitness with regard to a certain end or purpose are qualities of actions which may be gathered from experience but fitness or unfitness of actions as importing right or wrong as denoting what we ought to do or abstain from have truly no meaning unless upon supposition of a moral sense which this learned divine never once dreams of taking into his argument the doctors error therefore is a common one that he endeavors to substitute reason in place of feeling the fitness of worshipping our creator was obvious to him as it is to every man because it is founded in our very nature it is equally obvious with the preference of honesty to dishonesty his only mistake is that overlooking the law written in his own heart he vainly imagines that his metaphysical argument is just because the consequence he draws from it happens to be true and to satisfy even his most devoted disciples that this is the case let us only suppose that man by nature had no approbatory or disapprobatory feeling of actions it could never be evinced by any abstract argument whatever that the worship of the deity is his duty or in the moral sense of fitness that it is more fit for him to be honest than to be dishonest  and upon this head we will take the liberty to add because it is of importance to the subject in general that supposing our duty could be made plain to us by an abstract chain of reasoning yet we have good ground to conclude from analogy that the author of nature has not left our actions to be directed by so weak a principle as reason and a weak principle it must be to the bulk of mankind who have little capacity to enter into abstract reasoning whatever effect it may have upon the learned and contemplative nature has dealt more kindly by us we are compelled by strong and evident feelings to perform all the different duties of life selfpreservation is not left to the conduct of reason but is guarded by the strongest instinct which makes us carefully or rather mechanically avoid every appearance of danger the propagation of the species is enforced by the most importunate of all appetites and the care of our offspring by a lively and constant affection is nature so deficient as to leave the duty we owe our neighbor which stands in the first rank of duties to be directed by cool reasoning this is not according to the analogy of nature nor is it fact witness compassion friendship benevolence and all the tribe of the social affections neither is common justice left upon this footing the most useful though not the most exalted virtue the transgression of it is attended with a severe feeling of disapprobation and also enforced by other feelings still more cogent and authoritative  a late author woolaston  whom i shall just mention by the way gives a whimsical system of morals he endeavors to reduce all crimes to that of telling a lie and because telling a lie is immoral he concludes that the several crimes he mentions are immoral robbery for example is acting or telling a lie because it is in effect saying that the goods i seize are mine adultery is acting or telling a lie because it is in effect maintaining that my neighbors wife is not his but mine but not to insist upon the folly of giving all crimes the same character and confounding their nature it appears evident that in this argument the very thing is taken for granted which is to be proved for why is it a virtual lie to rob one of his goods is it not by imposing upon mankind who must presume those goods to be mine which i take as my own but does not this evidently presuppose a difference betwixt meum and tuum and that i ought not to make free with anothers property without his consent for what other reason are the goods presumed to be mine but that it is unlawful to meddle with what belongs to another the same observation will apply to all his other transmutations for in acting or telling the lie it is constantly taken for granted that the action is wrong in itself and this very wrong is the circumstance which is supposed in the reasoning to impose upon the spectators the error therefore of this author is of the same nature with dr clarks in his system above examined it is an evident petitio principii the very thing is taken for granted which is undertaken to be proved with regard to the present subject we have no occasion further to observe of this curious author that when he draws so strong consequences from telling a lie it was to be expected he should have set in the clearest light the immorality of that action but this he does not so much as attempt leaving it upon the conviction of ones own mind this indeed he might safely do but not more safely than to leave upon the same conviction all the other crimes he treats of  chap vii of justice and injustice justice is that moral virtue which guards property and gives authority to covenants and as it is made out above that justice being essentially necessary to the maintenance of society is one of those primary virtues which are enforced by the strongest natural laws it would be unnecessary to say more upon the subject were it not for a doctrine espoused by the author of a treatise upon human nature that justice so far from being one of the primary virtues is not even a natural virtue but established in society by a sort of tacit convention founded upon a notion of public interest the figure which this author deservedly makes in the learned world is too considerable to admit of his being past over in silence and as it is of great importance to creatures who live in society to have justice established upon its most solid foundation a chapter expressly upon this subject may perhaps not be unacceptable to the reader  our authors doctrine so far as it concerns that branch of justice by which property is secured comes to this that in a state of nature there can be no such thing as property and that the idea of property arises after justice is established by convention whereby every one is secured in his possessions in opposition to this singular doctrine there is no difficulty to make out that we have an idea of property antecedent to any sort of agreement or convention that property is founded on a natural principle and that violation of property is attended with remorse and a sense of breach of duty in following out this subject it will appear how admirably the springs of human nature are adapted one to another and to external circumstances  man is by nature fitted for labor and his enjoyment lies in action to this internal constitution his external circumstances are finely adapted the surface of this globe does scarce yield spontaneously food for the greatest savages but by labor and industry it is made to furnish not only the conveniences but even the luxuries of life in this situation it is wisely ordered that man should labor for himself and his family by providing a stock of necessaries for them before he think of serving others the great principle of selfpreservation directs him to this course now this very disposition of providing against want which is common to man with many other creatures involves the idea of property the ground i cultivate and the house i build must be considered as mine otherways i labor to no purpose there is a peculiar connection betwixt a man and the fruits of his industry felt by every one which is the very thing we call property were all the conveniences of life like air and water provided to our hand without labor or were we disposed to labor for the public without any selfish affections there would be no sense of property at least such a sense would be superfluous and unnecessary but when selfpreservation the most eminent of our principles of action directs every individual to labor for himself in the first place man without a sense or feeling of property would be an absurd being every man therefore must have a notion of property with regard to the things acquired by his own labor for this is the very meaning of working for ones self property so far is necessarily connected with selfpreservation but the idea of property is essentially the same whether it relate to myself or to another there is no difference but what is felt in surveying the goods of any two indifferent persons and were it consistent for a man to have the idea of his own property without having a notion of property in another such a man would be a very imperfect being and altogether unqualified for society if it could be made out that such is the constitution of mankind in general i should be much disposed to believe that we were made by a fortuitous concourse of atoms but the constitution of man is more wisely framed and more happily adjusted to his external circumstances not only man but all provident creatures who have the hording quality are endued with the sense or feeling of property which effectually secures each individual in the enjoyment of the fruits of its own labor and accordingly we find in perusing the history of mankind as far back as we have any traces of it that there never has been among any people or tribe such a thing as the possession of goods in common for even before agriculture was invented when men lived upon the natural fruits of the earth though the plenty of pasture made separate possessions unnecessary yet individuals had their own cattle and enjoyed the produce of their cattle separately  and it must not be overlooked that this sense of property is fortified by another principle every man has a peculiar affection for what he possesses exclusive of others and for what he calls his own he applies his skill and industry with great alacrity to improve his own subject his affection to it grows with the time of his possession and he puts a much greater value upon it than upon any subject of the same kind that belongs to another  here then is property established by the constitution of our nature antecedent to all human conventions we are led by nature to consider goods acquired by our industry and labor as belonging to us and as our own we have the sense or feeling of property and conceive these goods to be our own just as much as we conceive our hands our feet and our other members to be our own and we have a sense or feeling equally clear of the property of others what is here asserted is a matter of fact of which there can be no other decisive evidence than to appeal to every mans own feelings at the same time we need scarce any other proof of this fact than that yours and mine are terms familiar with the greatest savages and even with children they must have feelings which correspond to these terms otherways the terms would not be intelligible to them  but this is not all that is involved in the sense or feeling of property we not only suffer pain in having our goods taken from us by force for that would happen were they destroyed or lost by accident we have the feeling of wrong and injustice the person who robs us has the same feeling and every mortal who beholds the action considers it as vicious and contrary to right  but it is not sufficient to have overturned the foundation of our authors doctrine we will proceed to make some observations upon it to show how ill it hangs together  and in the first place he appears to reason not altogether consistently in making out his system he founds justice on a general sense of common interest vol   p     and yet at no greater distance than a few pages he endeavors to make out vol   p     and does it successfully that public interest is a motive too remote and too sublime to affect the generality of mankind and to operate with any force in actions so contrary to private interest as are frequently those of justice and common honesty  in the second place abstracting from the sense of property it does not appear that a sense of common interest would necessarily lead to such a regulation as that every man should have the undisturbed enjoyment of what he has acquired by his industry or good fortune supposing no sense of property i do not see it inconsistent with society to have a lacedemonian constitution that every man may lawfully take what by address he can make himself master of without force or violence the depriving us of that to which we have no affection would be doing little more than drinking in our brook or breathing in our air at any rate such a refined regulation would never be considered of importance enough to be established upon the very commencement of society it must come late if at all and be the effect of long experience and great refinement in the art of living it is very true that abstaining from the goods of others is a regulation without which society cannot well subsist but the necessity of this regulation arises from the sense of property without which a man would suffer little pain in losing his goods and would have no feeling of wrong or injustice there does not appear any way to evade the force of the above reasoning other than peremptorily to deny the reality of the sense of property others may but our author i think cannot with a good grace do it an appeal may be safely made to his own authority for is it not evidently this sense which has suggested to him the necessity in the institution of every society to secure individuals in their possessions he cannot but be sensible that abstracting from the affection for property the necessity would be just nothing at all but our feelings operate silently and imperceptibly and there is nothing more common than to strain for farfetched arguments in support of conclusions which are suggested by the simplest and most obvious feelings  a third observation is that since our author resolves all virtue into sympathy why should he withold the same principle from being the foundation of justice why should not sympathy give us a painful sensation in depriving our neighbor of the goods he has acquired by industry as well as in depriving him of his life or limb for it is a fact too evident to be denied that many men are more uneasy at the loss of their goods than at the loss of a member  and in the last place were justice only founded on a general sense of common interest it behoved to be the weakest feeling in human nature especially where injustice committed against a stranger is with whom we are not connected by any degree of benevolence now this is contrary to all experience the sense of injustice is one of the strongest that belongs to humanity and is attended with many peculiar modifications viz a feeling of acting contrary to the strictest obligations of duty and a feeling of merited punishment for the wrong committed had our author but once reflected upon these peculiar feelings he never could have been satisfied with the slight foundation he gives to justice for these feelings are altogether unaccountable upon his system  that branch of justice which regards promises and covenants appears also to have a most solid foundation in human nature notwithstanding of what is laid down by our author in two distinct propositions page  0   that a promise would not be intelligible before human conventions had established it and that even if it were intelligible it would not be attended with any moral obligation as man is framed for society mutual trust and confidence without which there can be no society enter into the character of the human species correspondent to these are the principles of veracity and fidelity and in this particular among many it is admirable to observe how accurately these principles are adapted to each other veracity and fidelity would be of no significancy were men not disposed to have faith and to rely upon what is said to them whether in the way of evidence or engagement faith and trust on the other hand would be very hurtful principles were mankind void of veracity and fidelity for upon that supposition the world would be overrun with fraud and deceit supposing a society once established the security of property as well as of life is indeed essentially necessary to its continuance and preservation for were men in danger from their fellows the condition of man behoved to be the same with that of savage animals who upon that very account shun all manner of commerce but fidelity and veracity are still more essential to society because without these principles there cannot be such a thing as society at all it could never have a beginning it is justly observed by our author that man in a solitary state is the most helpless of beings and that by society alone he is enabled to supply his defects and to acquire a superiority over his fellow creatures that by conjunction of forces our power is augmented by partition of employments we work to better purpose and by mutual succor we acquire security but without mutual fidelity and trust we could enjoy none of these advantages without them we could not have any comfortable intercourse with one another so that they are necessary even to the constitution of society hence it is that treachery is the vilest of crimes and what mankind have ever held in the utmost abhorrence it is worse than murder because it forms a character and is directed against all mankind whereas murder is only a transitory act directed against a single person infidelity is of the same species with treachery the essence of both crimes is the same to wit breach of trust treachery has only this aggravating circumstance that it turns the confidence reposed in me against the friend who trusts me now breach of promise is a species of infidelity and therefore our author has but a single choice he must either maintain that treachery is no crime or that breach of promise is a crime and in fact that it is so every man must bear evidence to himself the performance of a deliberate promise has in all ages been considered as a duty we have that sense and feeling of a promise as what we are bound to perform by a strict obligation and the breach of promise is attended with the same natural stings which attend other crimes sciz remorse and merited punishment  it is evident from the above that it is but an imperfect conception of a promise to consider it as our author does vol   p  0   with relation only to the person who makes the promise in this internal act two persons are concerned the person who makes the promise and the person to whom the promise is made were there by nature no trust nor reliance upon promises breach of promise would be a matter of indifferency therefore the essence of a promise consists in keeping faith the reliance upon us produced by our own act constitutes the obligation we feel ourselves bound to perform we consider it as our duty and when we violate our engagement we have a sense of moral turpitude in disappointing the person who relied upon our faith  we shall close this subject concerning the foundation of justice with a general reflection running over every branch of our duty what concerns ourselves as well as our neighbors we find that nature has been more provident than to trust us entirely to the guidance of cool reason it is observed above that our duty is enforced by instinct and appetite as well as it is directed by reason now if man be a social being and justice essential to society it is not according to the analogy of nature that we should be left to investigate this branch of our duty by a chain of reasoning especially where the reasoning turns upon so remote an object as that of public good may we not apply to justice what is so beautifully reasoned concerning society in a dialogue upon happiness p      if society be thus agreeable to our nature is there nothing within us to excite and lead us to it no impulse no preparation of faculties it would be strange if there should not if we are fitted by our nature for society if pity benevolence friendship love the general dislike of solitude and desire of company are natural affections all of them conducive to society it would be strange if there should be no natural affections no preparation of faculties to direct us to do justice which is so essential to society but nature has not failed us here more than in the other parts of our constitution we have a feeling of property we have a feeling of obligation to perform our engagements and we have a feeling of wrong in encroaching upon property and in being untrue to our engagements society could not subsist without these affections more than it could subsist without the social affections properly so called we have reason a priori to conclude equally in favors of both and we find upon examination our conclusion to be just  chap viii of the primary laws of nature we are now come to the thing principally intended in this essay which is to give a general view of the primary laws of nature action ought to be the end and aim of all our inquiries without which moral as well as metaphysical reasonings are but empty speculation and as life and manners are more peculiarly the object of the moral science it was to be expected that the weight and importance of the subject should have brought authors to one way of thinking but it is lamentable to find the world divided about these primary laws almost as much as they commonly are about the most airy and abstract points some authors acknowledge no principle in man but what is altogether selfish and it is curious to observe how they wrest and torture every social principle to give it the appearance of selfishness others exalt human nature much bove its just standard give no quarter to selfishness but consider man as bound to direct every action to the good of the whole and not to prefer his own interest to that of others the celebrated lord shaftesbury goes so far as not to admit of any thing like partial benevolence holding that if it is not entire and directed to the whole species it is not benevolence at all it is not difficult to assign a cause for such difference in opinion though it may appear strange that authors should differ so widely upon a subject which every man ought to be acquainted with because the subject is his own constitution there is nothing more common in philosophy as well as in life and action than to build castles in the air impatient of the slow and cold method of induction we fly to systems which every writer takes the liberty of framing according to his own taste and fancy fond of the fabric which he himself has erected it is far from his thoughts to subject it to examination by trying whether it will stand the test of stubborn facts men of narrow minds and contracted principles naturally fall in with the selfish system the system of universal benevolence attracts the generous and warmhearted in the midst of various and opposite opinions the purpose of this essay is to search for truth by the patient method of induction and after what is above laid down it will not be difficult to find it  let us only recapitulate that the principles of action furnish motives to action and that the moral sense is given as an instructor to regulate our actions to enforce one motive to restrain another and to prefer one to another when they are in competition hence the laws of nature may be defined to be rules of our conduct and behavior founded on natural principles approved of by the moral sense and enforced by natural rewards and punishments  in searching for these laws it must be obvious that we may safely indulge every principle of action where the action is not disapproved of by the moral sense and that we ought to perform every action which the moral sense informs us to be our duty from this short proposition may be readily deduced all the laws of nature which govern human actions though in the present essay the duty which a man owes to himself where others are not concerned is not comprehended  and with regard to our general principles of action selfpreservation being the leading principle it is hard to say that any means strictly speaking are unlawful to attain that end if two men in a shipwreck get hold at the same instant of a plank which is not bulky enough to support both it is lawful for the one to thrust off the other in order to save his own life this action is not condemned by the moral sense it is not attended with any feeling of wrong in like manner it is lawful for a man to seize upon food wherever he can find it to keep himself from dying of hunger  upon the same principle it is lawful for a man to save a member of his own body at the expense of anothers member if both cannot be saved a man will scarce have any consciousness of wrong in so doing but it will hardly be allowed in morality to save a member at the expense of anothers life this matter however is not to be reduced to any accurate rule the determination of questions of this kind must necessarily vary according to the circumstances of the persons concerned and according to the temper and disposition of the actor  the second general principle in point of rank is selflove which being a more powerful principle than benevolence it naturally assumes the preference and we meet with no obstruction from the moral sense when we prefer our own interest to that of others the same will hold with regard to our particular appetites passions and affections but here comes a remarkable limitation that we are not to indulge selflove at the expense of harming others whether in their persons goods or reputation the moral sense in every case selfpreservation excepted lays us under an absolute restraint with regard to these particulars this restraint is felt as our indispensible duty and the transgression of this duty never fails to be attended with remorse and a dread of merited punishment and this is wisely ordered society could not be preserved without such a law and even abstracting from society the law is essentially necessary to attain the ends proposed by the two great principles of action selfpreservation and selflove no man could be secure of his life a moment far less of his happiness if men worse than savage beasts preyed upon one another  the third principle which is that of fidelity is also in the strictest sense a law of nature we are bound to take care of our children to perform our promises and to stand true to our engagements it need only be observed upon this head that the obligation is indispensible and yields to no other principle or law of nature if it be not selfpreservation alone  gratitude the fourth principle is likeways to be ranked among the laws of nature we feel it in the strictest sense as our duty the transgression of this law is not only attended with selfdisapprobation but with hatred and contempt from others  benevolence the last principle may be indulged at pleasure and without restraint unless where it comes in competition with a strict obligation if it is directed to advance the happiness of others it is not to be ranked strictly speaking among our duties because though actions of this kind are highly rewarded by selfapprobation and the love of others yet the neglect of them is not attended with remorse or punishment it is true that a person of a sociable and generous temper will be strongly impelled to actions of this kind and will feel pain and uneasiness upon reflecting that he has not been so useful to his friends his country or mankind as he might have been but this uneasiness does not arise to what is properly called remorse or selfcondemnation though it may in some instances approach to it there is undoubtedly a distinction here though it be not easy to ascertain the precise limits of feelings that are so much allied to one another any more than it is to fix the exact boundary betwixt light and darkness or to distinguish the very last shade of any color in tints that run into each other to instance in another case which belongs to the same head of benevolence we are obliged to provide for our children it is strict duty and the neglect of it causes remorse in the case of an only brother suppose or some very near friend who depends entirely on our help we feel somewhat of the same kind of obligation though in a weaker degree and thus through other connections it diminishes by successive gradations till at last the motive to benevolence is lost in simple approbation without any obligatory feeling this is universally the course which nature holds her transitions are soft and gentle she makes things approximate so nicely one to another as to leave no gap or chasm where the object of these feelings can be clearly and fully distinguished it may be safely asserted that in the general case of procuring positive good to others or advancing happiness it is selfapprobation and not strict obligation that is felt but where the object of benevolence is distress there it becomes a duty provided it is in our power to afford relief without hurting ourselves the neglect of such an action is certainly attended with remorse and selfcondemnation though possibly not of so strong a kind as where we betray our trust or are the authors of positive mischief to others thus charity is by all mankind considered as a duty to which we are strictly bound  these are the outlines of the laws which govern our actions comprehending both what we may do and what we ought to do and now dropping the former to be indulged by every one at pleasure without restraint we shall confine ourselves to the latter as the more proper subject of laws both natural and municipal and no more seems to be requisite in this matter than clearly to point out our duty by informing us of what we ought to do and what we ought not to do seeing actions which come not under the character of duty may be safely left to our own choice with regard then to what may be called our duty the first and primary law is the law of restraint by which we are prohibited to hurt others in their persons goods or whatever else is dear to them the second is a positive law that we ought to relieve those in distress the omission of this duty does not coeteris paribus affect us so strongly with the sense of wrong as the transgression does of the former law because the creating of positive pain has a greater effect upon the mind than merely the forbearing to relieve others from pain as there is a closer connection in the imagination betwixt a man and his actions than betwixt a man and any action he forbears to do fidelity comes in the third place as a positive duty comprehending the care of our offspring performance of promises executing trusts etc gratitude takes up the fourth place of positive duty and that branch of benevolence having for its object the advancing the good of others takes up the last place which if at all to be ranked among our duties is then only to be ranked when it is applied to those who are nearly connected with us and to general objects such as our town our religion our government  these several laws are admirably adjusted to our nature and circumstances and tend in the most perfect manner to promote the ends of society in the first place as man is limited with regard to power and capacity the above laws are accommodated to his nature ordering and forbidding nothing but what falls within his compass in the second place peace and security in society are amply provided for by tying up the hands as it were of every man from harming others in the third place man is prompted to the utmost of his ability to be useful to others it is his positive duty to relieve the distressed and perform his engagements and he is incited to do all the good he can by the pleasure of the action by benevolence and gratitude from the persons obliged and lastly in competition betwixt himself and others though his principles of action directed upon himself may be stronger than those directed upon others the superior rewards bestowed by the constitution of our nature upon the latter may be deemed a sufficient counterbalance to give an ascendent to the social affections  it may seem strange that the municipal law of all countries is so little regardful of the laws of nature as to adopt but a very few of them there never was a positive law in any country to punish ingratitude if it was not among the ancient persians there is no positive law to enforce compassion and to relieve those in distress if the maintenance of the poor be excepted which in some countries is provided for by law no notice is taken of breach of friendship by statute nor of the duty we owe our children further than of supporting them while they are under age but municipal laws being of human invention are of no great extent they cannot reach the heart nor its intentions further than as expressed by outward acts and these are to be judged of cautiously and with reserve because they form a language dark and at best full of ambiguities at the same time the object of human laws is man considered singly in the quality of a citizen when society is formed and government submitted to every private right is given up inconsistent with society and government but in every other respect individuals reserve their independency and their private rights whether a man be virtuous is not the concern of the society at least not of its laws but only whether he transgress those regulations which are necessary to the preservation of society in this view great attention is given by the legislature in every country to enforce the natural law of restraint from mutual hurt and injury the like attention is given to enforce the natural obligation of fidelity at least so far as relates to commerce for infidelity in love and friendship are left to the natural law ingratitude is not punished by human laws because it may be guarded against by positive engagements nor hardheartedness with regard to objects of distress because society may subsist without such a law and mankind are scarce yet arrived at such refinement in manners as to have an abhorrence of this crime sufficient to make it an object of human punishment  there is another substantial reason which confines human laws within a much narrower compass than the laws of nature it is essential to human laws that they be clear plain and readily applicable to particular cases without which judges would be arbitrary and law made a handle for oppression for this reason none of our actions can be the object of positive law but what are reducible to a precise rule ingratitude therefore cannot be the object of human laws because the quality of the crime depends upon a multiplicity of circumstances which can never be reduced to a precise rule duty to our children friends and relations is with regard to most circumstances in the same case the duty of relieving the distressed in like manner depends upon many circumstances the nature of the distress the connection betwixt the parties the opportunity and ability of affording relief the abstinence from mutual harm and the performance of promises are capable to be brought under a precise rule and these only are the objects of human laws  chap ix of the law of nations if we can trust history the original inhabitants of this earth were a brutish and savage race and we have little reason to doubt of the fact when even at this day we find the same sort of people in distant corners who have no communication with the rest of mankind the state of nature is accordingly represented by all writers as a state of war nothing going on but rapine and bloodshed from this picture of the first men one would be apt to conclude that man by nature is a wild and rapacious animal little better than a beast of prey but for his inclination to society which moulds him gradually into a rational creature if this conclusion be just we cannot help being in some pain for the principles above laid down brutish manners imply brutish principles of action and from this view of the original state of mankind it may seem that moral virtues are not natural but acquired by means of education and example in a well regulated society in a word that the whole moral part of our system is artificial as justice is represented by a late writer  but to be satisfied of the fallacy of this conclusion we need only look back to what has already been said upon the moral sense if the feeling of beauty and deformity in external existences be natural to man the feeling of beauty and deformity and of a right and wrong in actions is equally so and indeed whatever be the influence of education and example it is an evident truth that they can never have the power of creating any one sense or feeling they may well have the effect of cherishing and improving the plants of natures formation but they cannot introduce any new or original plant whatever we must therefore attribute the above appearances to some other cause than want of the moral sense and these appearances may easily be accounted for from peculiar circumstances that are sufficient to overbalance the most vigorous operations of the moral sense and to produce in a good measure the same effects which would result from a total absence of that sense let us point out these circumstances for the subject is worthy of our strictest attention the original situation of mankind will in the first place be attended to when the earth was uncultivated and in a great measure barren when there was a scarcity of instruments for raising habitations and a greater scarcity of manufactures to supply the necessities of life in this state man was a most indigent creature and upon the principle of selfpreservation entitled to supply his wants the best way he could without any obstruction from the moral sense thus there behoved to be a constant opposition of interests and of consequence perpetual discord at the same time there being no established rules of conduct to appeal to nor judges to apply rules to particular cases wars of old behoved to be at least as frequent as law suits are at present in this state barbarity roughness and cruelty formed the character of the human species for in the practice and habit of war the malevolent principles gain strength and vigor as the benevolent principles do by the arts of peace and to this consideration may be added that man is by nature shy and timorous and consequently cruel when he gets the upperhand the security obtained in society puts an end in a great measure to our fears man becomes a magnanimous and generous creature not easily daunted and therefore not easily provoked to acts of cruelty  it may be observed in the next place that the rude and illiterate are governed by their appetites and passions more than by general principles we have our first impressions from particular objects it is by education and practice that we acquire a facility in forming complex ideas and abstract propositions the ideas of a common interest of a country of a people of a society under government of public good are complex and not soon acquired even by the thinking part of mankind they are scarce ever to be acquired by the rude and illiterate and consequently do not readily become the object of any of their affections ones own interest considered in general is too complex an object for the bulk of mankind and therefore it is that the particular appetites and passions are stronger motives to action with the ignorant and unthinking than the principle of selflove or even than of selfpreservation when it is not incited by some particular object which threatens danger and the same must hold more strongly with regard to the affections of benevolence charity and such like when there is no particular object in view but only in general the good of others  man is a complex machine composed of various principles of motion which may be conceived as so many springs and weights counteracting and balancing one another these being accurately adjusted the movement of life is beautiful because regular and uniform but if some springs or weights be withdrawn those which remain acting now without opposition from their antagonist forces will disorder the balance and derange the whole machine remove those principles of action which operate by reflection and whose objects are complex and general ideas and the necessary consequence will be to double the force of the appetites and passions pointing at particular objects which is always the case with those who act by sense and not by reflection they are tyrannised by passion and appetite and have no consistent rule of conduct no wonder that the moral sense is of no sufficient authority to command obedience in such a case this is the character of savages we have no reason then to conclude from the above picture that even the greatest savages are destitute of the moral sense their defect rather lies in the weakness of their general principles of action which terminate in objects too complex for savages readily to comprehend this defect is remedied by education and reflection and then it is that the moral sense in concert with these general principles acquires its full authority which is openly recognized and cheerfully submitted to  the contemplation is beautiful when we compare our gradual improvement in knowledge and in morality we begin with surveying particular objects and lay in a stock of simple ideas our affections keep pace being all directed to particular objects and during this period we are governed principally by our passions and appetites so soon as we begin to form complex and general ideas these also become the objects of our affections then it is that love to our country begins to exert itself benevolence to our neighbors and acquaintances affection to our relations as such we acquire by degrees the taste of public good and of being useful in life the pleasures of society thicken upon us the selfish passions are tamed and subdued and the social affections gain the ascendant we refine upon the pleasures of society because our happiness principally consists in social intercourse we learn to submit our opinions we affect to give preference to others and readily accommodate ourselves to every thing which may render society more complete the malevolent passions above all are brought under the strictest culture if not totally eradicated instead of unbounded revenge for the smallest injury we acquire a degree of selfdenial to overlook trifling wrongs and in greater wrongs to be satisfied with moderate reparation  at the same time it is true that the moral sense though rooted in the nature of man admits of great refinements by culture and education it improves gradually like our other powers and faculties till it comes to be productive of the strongest as well as most delicate feelings to clear this point every one must be sensible of the great advantages of education and imitation the most polished nations differ only from savages in refinement of taste which being productive of nice and delicate feelings is the source of pleasure and pain more exquisite than savages are susceptible of hence it is that many actions which make little impression upon savages appear to us elegant and beautiful as on the other hand actions which give them no pain raise in us aversion and disgust this may be illustrated by a comparison betwixt the english and french dramatic performances the english a rough and hardy people take delight in representations which more refined manners render insupportable to their neighbors the distresses on the other hand represented on the french theater are too slight for an english audience their passions are not raised they feel no concern in general horror which denotes the highest degree of pain and aversion that can be raised by a harsh action is a passion seldom felt among fierce and savage nations where humanity is little regarded but when the tender affections are improved by society horror is more easily raised and objects which move horror become more frequent  the moral sense not only accompanies our other senses in their gradual refinement but receives additional strength upon every occasion from these other senses for example a savage enured to acts of cruelty feels little pain or aversion in putting an enemy to death in cold blood and consequently will have no remorse at such an action other than what proceeds from the moral sense acting by its native strength but let us suppose a person of so delicate feelings as scarce to endure a common operation of phlebotomy and who cannot behold without some degree of horror the amputation of a fractured member such a person will be shocked to the highest degree if he see an enemy put to death in cold blood the grating emotion thus raised in him must communicate itself to the feelings of the moral sense and render them much more acute and thus refinement in taste and manners operating by communication upon the moral sense occasions a stronger feeling of immorality in every vicious action than what would arise before such refinement at the same time the moral sense improves in its delicacy as well as the other senses whereby a double effect is produced owing to a double cause and therefore upon the whole the operations of the moral sense in a savage bear no proportion to its operations in a person who stands possessed of all the advantages which human nature is susceptible of by refined education  i never was satisfied with the description given of the law of nations commonly so called that it is a law established among nations by common consent for regulating their conduct with regard to each other this foundation of the law of nations i take to be chimerical for upon what occasion was this covenant made and by whom if it be said that the sense of common good gradually brought this law into force i answer that the sense of common good is too complex and too remote an object to be a solid foundation for any positive law if it has no other foundation in our nature but there is no necessity to recur to so slender a foundation what is just now observed will lead us to a more rational account of these laws they are no other but gradual refinements of the original law of nature accommodating itself to the improved state of mankind the law of nature which is the law of our nature cannot be stationary it must vary with the nature of man and consequently refine gradually as human nature refines putting an enemy to death in cold blood is now looked upon with distaste and horror and therefore is immoral though it was not always so in the same degree it is considered as barbarous and inhuman to fight with poisoned weapons and therefore is more remarkably disapproved of by the moral sense than it was originally influenced by general objects we have enmity against france which is our natural enemy but this enmity is not directed against individuals conscious as we are that it is the duty of subjects to serve their king and country therefore we treat prisoners of war with humanity and now it is creeping in among civilized nations that in war a cartel should be established for exchange of prisoners the function of an ambassador has ever been held sacred to treat him ill was originally immoral because it is treating as an enemy the man who comes to us with friendly intentions but the improved manners of latter times have refined upon the privileges of an ambassador and extended them far beyond what they were originally it is very true that these refinements of the law of nature gain strength and firmness by custom hereby they acquire the additional support of common consent for as every nation trusts that these laws will be observed it is upon that account a breach of faith to transgress them but this is not peculiar to these particular institutions which pass under the name of the law of nations there is the same adventitious foundation for all the laws of nature which every man trusts will be observed and upon that faith directs his conduct  essay iii of liberty and necessity when we apply our thoughts to the contemplation of final causes no subject more readily presents itself than the natural world which is stamped with the brightest characters of wisdom and goodness the moral world being less in view has been generally overlooked though it yields not to the other in rich materials mans inward system accurately surveyed will be found not less admirable than the external system of which he makes a part the subject is the more curious that the traces of wisdom and design discernible in our internal frame ly more out of common sight they are touches as it were of a finer pencil and of a nicer hand than are discovered in the natural world thought is more subtle than motion and more of exquisite art is displayed in the laws of voluntary action than there is place for in adjusting the laws of mere matter  an extreme beautiful scene opens to our view when we consider with what propriety the ideas feelings and whole constitution of the mind of man correspond to his present state the impressions he receives and the notions he forms are accurately adapted to the useful purposes of life though they do not correspond in every instance to the philosophic truth of things it was not intended that man should make profound discoveries he is framed to be more an active than a contemplative being and his views both of the natural and moral world are so adjusted as to be made subservient to correctness of action rather than of belief several instances there are of perceptions which for want of a more proper term may be called deceitful because they differ from the real truth but man is not thereby in the least misled on the contrary the ends of life and action are better provided for by such artifice than if these perceptions were more exact copies of their objects  in the natural world somewhat of this kind is generally admitted by modern philosophers it is found that the representations of external objects and their qualities conveyed by the senses sometimes differ from what philosophy discovers these objects and their qualities to be thus a surface appears smooth and uniform when its roughness is not such as to be hurtful the same surface examined with a microscope is found to be full of ridges and hollows were man endowed with a microscopic eye the bodies that surround him would appear as different from what they do at present as if he were transported into another world his ideas upon that supposition would indeed be more agreeable to strict truth but they would be far less serviceable in common life further it is now universally admitted that the qualities called secundary which we by natural instinct attribute to matter belong not properly to matter nor exist really without us color in particular is a sort of visionary beauty which nature has spread over all her works it is a wonderful artifice to present objects to us thus differently distinguished to mark them out to the eye in various attires so as to be best known and remembered and to paint on the fancy gay and lively grand and striking or sober and melancholy scenes whence many of our most pleasurable and most affecting sensations arise yet all this beauty of colors with which heaven and earth appear clothed is a sort of romance and illusion for among external objects to which colors are attributed by sense there is really no other distinction than what arises from a difference in the size and arrangement of the constituent parts whereby the rays of light are reflected or refracted in such different ways as to paint various colors on the retina of the eye from this and other instances of the same kind which might be adduced it appears that our perceptions some times are less accommodated to the truth of things than to the end for which our senses are designed nature at the same time has provided a remedy for she seldom or never leaves us without means of discovering the deception and arriving at the truth and it is wonderful that even when we act upon these deceitful impressions we are not betrayed into any thing that is hurtful on the contrary life and action are better provided for and the ends of our being fulfilled to more advantage than if we conducted ourselves by the strictest truth of things  let us carry on this speculation from the natural to the moral world and examine whether there are not here also analogous instances of deceitful impressions this will lead us into an unbeaten tract we are to open a scene entirely new which like most other things that are new may perhaps surprise the reader but he will suspend his judgment till he has leisurely reviewed the whole and then let him pronounce whether our hypothesis does not solve all the phoenomena whether it does not tally with the nature of man and illustrate the wisdom and goodness of the author of his nature  that nothing can happen without a cause is a principle embraced by all men the illiterate and ignorant as well as the learned nothing that happens is conceived as happening of itself but as an effect produced by some other thing however ignorant of the cause we notwithstanding conclude that every event must have a cause we should perhaps be at a loss to deduce this principle from any premises by a chain of reasoning but feeling affords conviction where reason leaves us in the dark we perceive we feel the proposition to be true and indeed a sentiment common to all must be founded on the common nature of all curiosity is one of the earliest passions that are discovered in children and their curiosity runs on nothing more than to have causes and reasons given them why such a thing happened or how it came about historians and politicians make it their chief concern to trace the causes of actions the most mysterious not excepted be an event ever so extraordinary the feeling of its being an effect is not in the least weakened even with the vulgar who rather than assign no cause recur to the operation of invisible powers what is a cause with respect to its proper effect is considered as an effect with respect to some prior cause and so backward without end events thus viewed in a train of causes and effects should naturally be considered one would think as necessary and fixed for the relation betwixt a cause and its effect implies somewhat precise and determinate and leads our thoughts to what must be and cannot be otherways than it is  that we have such a feeling as is above described is not to be controverted and yet when we search further into human nature a feeling of an opposite kind is discovered a feeling of chance or contingency in events which is not less deeply rooted in our nature than the former however strange it may appear that man should be composed of such inconsistencies the fact must notwithstanding be admitted this feeling of chance or contingency is most conspicuous when we look forward to future events some things we indeed always consider as certain or necessary such as the revolution of seasons and the rising and setting of the sun these as experience teaches are regulated by fixed laws but many things appear to us loose fortuitous uncertain uncertain not only with respect to us on account of our ignorance of the cause but uncertain in themselves or not tied down and predetermined to fall out by any invariable law we naturally make a distinction betwixt things that must be and things that may be or may not be thus we have a feeling of chance or of contingency in events in which that other feeling of the dependency of events upon precise and determinate causes appears to be lost  when we consider in what view our own actions are perceived by the mind there is something which is equally strange and surprising it is admitted by all men that we act from motives the plain man as well as the philosopher feels the connection betwixt an action and its motive to be so strong that from this feeling both of them reason with full confidence about the future actions of others that an avaritious man will take every fair opportunity of acquiring riches is as little doubted as that rain and sunshine will make plants grow why but because the motive of gain is judged to operate as certainly and infallibly upon his temper as heat and moisture upon the soil each to produce its proper effect if we are uncertain what part a man will act the uncertainty arises not from our doubting whether he will act from a motive for this is never called in question it arises from our not being able to judge what the motive is which in his present circumstances will prevail it being then a natural feeling that actions are so connected with their proper motives as necessarily to arise from the temper character and other circumstances of the agent it should seem that all the train of human actions would occur to our minds as necessary and fixed yet human actions do not always appear to us in this light it is a matter of fact that the feeling varies according to the different positions of the object previous to any particular action we indeed always judge that the action will be the necessary result of some motive but has a man done what is wrong and shameful instantly the feeling varies we accuse and we condemn him for acting the wrong and shameful part we conceive that he had a power of acting otherways and ought to have acted otherways the whole train of our feeling in a moment accommodate themselves to the supposition of his being entirely a free agent  these are phenomenon in human nature of a very singular kind feelings which on both sides are natural and yet clash with each other every event admitted to have a necessary cause and yet many events supposed contingent every action admitted necessarily to flow from a determining motive and yet the same action in an after view considered and judged of as free our feelings are no doubt the test of truth which is so evident that in many instances no other means are afforded us for coming at the truth the few exceptions that are discovered by reason or experience serve the more to confirm the general rule but the feelings we have now laid open can be no test of truth because in contradictory propositions truth cannot ly on both sides there is no other way to get out of this labyrinth of doubts and difficulties than to enter upon a strict survey both of the natural and moral world which may possibly lead to a discovery of what is really the truth of the matter let us then proceed with impartiality and attention to inquire what we are to believe concerning contingency in events and liberty or necessity in human actions whether our feelings can be reconciled to each other and reconciled to truth or whether there be not here some of those deceitful feelings which we have already hinted in some other instances to belong to our nature  taking a view of the natural world we find all things there proceeding in a fixed and settled train of causes and effects it is a point which admits of no dispute that all the changes produced in matter and all the different modifications it assumes are the result of fixed laws every effect is so precisely determined that no other effect could in such circumstances have possibly resulted from the operation of the cause which holds even in the minutest changes of the different elements as all philosophers admit casual and fluctuating as these seem their smallest variation is a necessary effect of preestablished laws there is a chain of causes and effects which hang one upon another running through this whole system and not the smallest link of the chain can be broken without altering the whole constitution of things or suspending the regular operation of the laws of nature here then in the material world there is nothing that can be called contingent nothing that is left loose but every thing must be precisely what it is and be found in that state in which we find it  in the moral world this does not appear so clearly man is the actor here he is endowed with will and he acts from choice he has a power of beginning motion which is subject to no mechanical laws and therefore he is not under what is called physical necessity he has appetites and passions which prompt him to their respective gratifications but he is under no necessity of blind ly submitting to their impulse for reason has a power of restraint it suggests motives from the cool views of good and evil he deliberates upon these in consequence of his deliberation he chooses and here if anywhere lies our liberty let us examine to what this liberty amounts that motives have some influence in determining the mind is certain and that they have this influence in different degrees is equally certain the sense of honor and gratitude for instance are powerful motives to serve a friend let the mans private interest concur and the motives become more powerful add the certain prospect of poverty shame or bodily suffering if he shall act a different part and you leave him no choice the motives to action are rendered irresistible motives being once allowed to have a determining force in any degree it is easy to suppose the force so augmented by accumulation of motives as to leave little freedom to the mind or rather none at all in such instances there is no denying that we are under a necessity to act and though this to be sure is not physical necessity as arising not from the laws of matter but from the constitution of the mind yet the consequence is equally certain fixed and unavoidable in the case of moral as of physical necessity this is so true that in some instances these two kinds of necessity seem to coincide so as scarcely to be distinguished a criminal walks to the scaffold in the midst of his guards no man will deny that he is under an absolute necessity in this case why because he knows that if he refuses to go they will drag him i ask is this a physical or a moral necessity the answer at first view is not obvious for the distinction betwixt these two seems lost and yet strictly speaking it is only a moral necessity for it is the force of a motive which determines the criminal to walk to the scaffold to wit that resistance is vain because the guards are neither to be forced nor corrupted the idea of necessity however in the minds of the spectators when they view the criminal in this situation is not less strong than if they saw him bound and carried on a sledge nothing is more common than to talk of an action which one must do and cannot avoid he was compelled to it we say and it was impossible he could act otherways when at the same time all the compulsion we mean is only the application of some very strong motive to the mind this shows that in the judgment and feeling of all mankind a motive may in certain circumstances carry in it the power of rendering an action necessary in other words we expect such an action in consequence of such a motive with equal confidence as when we expect to see a stone fall to the ground when it is dropped from the hand  this it will be said may hold in some instances but not in all for in the greater part of human actions there is a real feeling of liberty when the mind hesitates betwixt two things examines and compares and at last comes to a resolution is there any compulsion or necessity here no compulsion it is granted but as to necessity let us pause and examine more accurately the resolution being taken the choice being made upon what is it founded certainly upon some motive however silent or weak for no mortal ever came to a determination without the influence of some motive or other if this be an undoubted fact it follows of consequence that the determination must result from that motive which has the greatest influence for the time or from what appears the best and most eligible upon the whole if motives be of very different kinds with regard to strength and influence which we feel to be the case it is involved in the very idea of the strongest motive that it must have the strongest effect in determining the mind this can no more be doubted of than that in a balance the greater weight must turn the scale  here perhaps we shall be interrupted men are not always rational in their determinations they often act from whim passion humor things as loose and variable as the wind this is admitted but suppose the motive which determines the mind to be as whimsical and unreasonable as you please its influence however is equally necessary with that of the most rational motive an indolent man for instance is incited to action by the strongest considerations which reason virtue interest can suggest he wavers and hesitates at last resists them all and folds his arms what is the cause of this is it that he is less under the power of motives than another man by no means the love of rest is his motive his prevailing passion and this is as effectual to fix him in his place as the love of glory or riches are to render active the vain or the covetous in short if motives are not under our power or direction which is confessedly the fact we can at bottom have no liberty we are so constituted that we cannot exert a single action but with some view aim or purpose at the same time when two opposite motives present themselves we have not the power of an arbitrary choice we are directed by a necessary determination of our nature to prefer the strongest motive  it is true that in disputing upon this subject of human liberty a man may attempt to show that motives have no necessary influence by eating perhaps the worst apple that is before him or in some such trifling instance preferring an obviously lesser good to a greater but is it not plain that the humor of showing that he can act against motives is in this case the very motive of the whimsical preference  a comparison instituted betwixt moral and physical necessity may possibly throw additional light upon this subject where the motives to any action are perfectly full cogent and clear the feeling of liberty as we showed before entirely vanishes in other cases where the field of choice is wider and where opposite motives counterbalance and work against each other the mind fluctuates for a while and feels itself more loose but in the end must as necessarily be determined to the side of the most powerful motive as the balance after several vibrations must incline to the side of the preponderating weight the laws of mind and the laws of matter are in this respect perfectly similar though in making the comparison we are apt to deceive ourselves in forming a notion of physical necessity we seldom think of any force but what has visibly a full effect a man in prison or tied to a post must remain there if he is dragged along he cannot resist whereas motives which from the highest to the lowest are very different do not always produce sensible effects yet when the comparison is accurately instituted the very same thing holds in the actions of matter a weak motive makes some impression but in opposition to one more powerful it has no effect to determine the mind in the precise same manner a small force will not overcome a great resistance nor the weight of an ounce in one scale counterbalance a pound in the other comparing together the actions of mind and matter similar causes will in both equally produce similar effects  but admitting all that has been contended for of the necessary influence of motives to bring on the choice or last judgment of the understanding it is urged by dr clark that man is still a free agent because he has a power of acting or beginning motion according to his will in this he places human liberty that motives are not physical efficient causes of motion vid demonstration of the being and attributes p     fol edit and his answer to colins passim  we agree with the doctor that the immediate efficient cause of motion is not the motive but the will to act no person ever held that the pleasure of a summerevening when a man goes abroad into the fields is the immediate cause of the motion of his feet but what does this observation avail when the prevailing motive the will to act and the action itself are three things inseparably linked together the motive according to his own concession necessarily determines the will and the will necessarily produces the action unless it be obstructed by some foreign force is not the action by consequence as necessary as the will to act tho the motive be the immediate cause of the will only and not of the action or beginning of motion what does this author gain by showing that we have a power of beginning motion if that power never is never can be exerted unless in consequence of some volition or choice which is necessarily caused but says he it is only a moral necessity which is produced by motives and a moral necessity he adds is no necessity at all but is consistent with the highest liberty if these words have any meaning the dispute is at an end for moral necessity being that sort of necessity which affects the mind and physical necessity that which affects matter it is plain that in all reasonings concerning human liberty moral necessity and no other is meant to be established the laws of action we say which respect the human mind are as fixed as those which respect matter the different nature of these laws occasions the fixed consequences of the one to be called moral and of the other to be called physical necessity but the idea of necessary certain unavoidable equally agrees to both and to say that moral necessity is no necessity at all because it is not physical necessity which is all that the doctors argument amounts to is no better than to argue that physical necessity is no necessity at all because it is not moral necessity  one great source of confusion in reflecting upon this subject seems to be our not distinguishing betwixt necessity and constraint in common language these are used as equivalent terms but they ought to be distinguished when we treat of this subject a person having a strong desire to escape remains in prison because the doors are guarded finding his keepers gone he makes his escape his escape now is as necessary i e as certain and infallible a consequence of the circumstances he finds himself in as his confinement was before though in the one case there is constraint in the other none in this lies the liberty of our actions in being free from constraint and in acting according to our inclination and choice but as this inclination and choice is unavoidably caused or occasioned by the prevailing motive in this lies the necessity of our actions that in such circumstances it was impossible we could act otherways in this sense all our actions are equally necessary  the preceding reasonings may perhaps make a stronger impression by being reduced into a short argument after this manner no man can be conceived to act without some principle leading him to action all our principles of action resolve into desires and aversions for nothing can prompt us to move or exert ourselves in any shape but what presents some object to be either pursued or avoided a motive is an object so operating upon the mind as to produce either desire or aversion now liberty as opposed to moral necessity must signify a power in the mind of acting without or against motives that is to say a power of acting without any view purpose or design and even of acting in contradiction to our own desires and aversions or to all our principles of action which power besides that no man was ever conscious of it seems to be an absurdity altogether inconsistent with a rational nature  with regard to things supposed so equal as to found no preference of one to another it is not necessary to enter into any intricate inquiry how the mind in such cases is directed though it should be admitted that where there is no sort of motive to influence the mind it may exert a power of acting arbitrarily this would not affect the preceding reasonings in which the existence of a motive being once supposed we have shown the mind to be necessarily determined objects so balanced one against another with perfect equality if such instances are to be found must be so few and in matters so trivial as in the common instance of eggs that they can have very inconsiderable influence upon human life it may well admit of a doubt whether the mind be in any case left altogether destitute of a motive to determine its choice betwixt two objects for though the objects should be themselves perfectly equal yet various circumstances arising from minute unobserved specialitics of fancy custom proximity of place etc may turn the scale in favors of one of the objects to make it the motive of election the uneasiness one is conscious of when in this state of suspense betwixt two things equally balanced searching and casting about for some ground of choice this uneasiness i say sufficiently shows that to act altogether arbitrary is unnatural and that our constitution fits us to be determined by motives  but now a thought comes across the mind which demands attention how hard is the lot of the human species to be thus tied down and fixed to motives subjected by a necessary law to the choice of evil if evil happen to be the prevailing motive or if it mislead us under the form of our greatest interest or good how happy to have had a free independent power of acting contrary to motives when the prevailing motive has a bad tendency by this power we might have pushed our way to virtue and happiness whatever motives were suggested by vice and folly to draw us back or we might by arbitrary will have refrained from acting the bad part though all the power of motives concurred to urge us on so far well but let us see whither this will carry us this arbitrary power being once supposed may it not be exerted against good motives as well as bad ones if it does us good by accident in restraining us from vice may it not do us ill by accident in restraining us from virtue and so shall we not be thrown loose altogether at this rate no man could be depended upon promises oaths vows would be in vain for nothing can ever bind or fix a man who is influenced by no motive the distinction of characters would be at an end for a person cannot have a character who has no fixed or uniform principles of action nay moral virtue itself and all the force of law rule and obligation would upon this hypothesis be nothing for no creature can be the subject of rational or moral government whose actions by the constitution of its nature are independent of motives and whose will is capricious and arbitrary to exhort to instruct to promise or to threaten would be to no purpose in short such a creature if such could exist would be a most bizarre and unaccountable being a mere absurdity in nature whose existence could serve no end were we so constituted as always to be determined by the moral sense even against the strongest countermotives this would be consistent with human nature because it would preserve entire the connection that by an unalterable law is established betwixt the will and the prevailing motive but to break this connection altogether to introduce an unbounded arbitrary liberty in opposition to which motives should not have influence would be instead of amending to deform and unhinge the whole human constitution no reason have we therefore to regret that we find the will necessarily subjected to motives the truth of this general position must coincide with our wish unless we would rather have man to be a whimsical and ridiculous than a rational and moral being  thus far then we have advanced in our argument that all human actions proceed in a fixed and necessary train man being what he is a creature endowed with a certain degree of understanding certain passions and principles and placed in certain circumstances it is impossible he should will or choose otherways than in fact he wills or chooses his mind is passive in receiving impressions of things as good or ill according to these impressions the last judgment of the understanding is necessarily formed which the will if considered as different from the last judgment of the understanding necessarily obeys as is fully shown and the external action is necessarily connected with the will or the minds final determination to act  in the course of this reasoning we have abstracted from all controversies about divine prescience and decree though in fact from what has been proved it appears that the divine being decrees all future events for he who gave such a nature to his creatures and placed them in such circumstances that a certain train of actions behoved necessarily to follow he i say who did so and who must have foreseen the consequences did certainly resolve or decree that events should fall out and men should act as they do prescience indeed is not properly speaking any cause of events for events do not happen because they are foreseen but because they are certainly to happen therefore they are capable of being foreseen though prescience does not cause yet it undoubtedly supposes the certain futurition as schoolmen speak of events and were there not causes which render the existence of future events certain it would involve a contradiction to maintain that future events could be certainly foreseen but i avoid carrying the reader any further into such thorny disputes  the sum of what we have discovered concerning contingency in events and liberty in actions is this comparing together the moral and the natural world every thing is as much the result of established laws in the one as in the other there is nothing in the whole universe that can properly be called contingent that may be or may not be nothing loose and fluctuating in any part of nature but every motion in the natural and every determination and action in the moral world are directed by immutable laws so that whilst these laws remain in their force not the smallest link of the universal chain of causes and effects can be broken nor any one thing be otherways than it is as to an objection of making god the author of sin which may seem to arise from our system it is rather popular than philosophical sin or moral turpitude lies in the evil intention of him who commits it it consists in some wrong or depraved affection supposed to be in the sinner now the intention of the deity is unerringly good the end proposed by him is order and general happiness and there is the greatest reason to believe that all events are so directed by him as to work toward this end in the present system of things some moral disorders are indeed included no doubt it is a considerable difficulty how evil comes to be in the world if god is perfectly good but this difficulty is not peculiar to our doctrine but recurs upon us at last with equal force whatever hypothesis we embrace for moral evil cannot exist without being at least permitted by the deity and with regard to a first cause permitting is the same thing with causing since against his will nothing can possibly happen all the schemes that have been contrived for answering this objection are but the tortoise introduced to support the elephant they put the difficulty a step further off but never remove it   the doctrine of universal necessity being thus laid fairly open and proved to be the true system of the universe we return to take a more deliberate view of the feelings of contingency and liberty than was necessary in broaching the subject and as we must now admit perhaps reluctantly that these feelings are in reality of the delusive kind our next and only remaining theme will be to unravel if possible this curious mystery by trying to reach the purpose of endowing man with feelings so contradictory to the truth of things  and to begin with a review of the feeling of contingency it is certain that in our ordinary train of thinking things never occur to us in the light above set forth a multitude of events appear to us as depending upon ourselves to cause or to prevent and we readily make a distinction betwixt events which are necessary i e which must be and events which are contingent i e which may be or may not be this distinction is without foundation in truth for all things that fall out either in the natural or moral world are as we have seen alike necessary and alike the result of fixed laws yet how much soever a philosopher may be convinced of this the distinction betwixt things necessary and things contingent remains as much with him in the common train of his thoughts as with any other man we act universally upon this supposed distinction nay it is in truth the foundation of all the labor care and industry of mankind to illustrate this by an example constant experience has taught us that death is a necessary event the human frame is not made to last as it is for ever and therefore no man thinks of acquiring a natural immortality but the particular time of our death appears a contingent event however certain it be that the precise time and manner of each mans death is determined by a train of preceding causes not less necessary than the hour of the suns rising or setting tomorrow yet no person is in the least affected by this doctrine in the care of prolonging life every man is conducted by the feeling he has of the contingency of the time of his death which to a certain term of years he considers as depending in a great measure upon himself by caution against accidents due use of exercise medicine etc to these means he applies himself with the same diligence as if there was in fact no necessary train of causes to fix the period of his life in short whoever attends to his own practical ideas whoever reflects upon the meaning of these words which occur in all languages of things possible contingent that are in our power to cause or prevent whoever i say reflects upon such words will clearly see that they suggest certain feelings or natural notions repugnant to the doctrine above established of universal necessity this repugnancy of feeling to truth gave rise to the famous dispute concerning things possible among the ancient stoics who held this doctrine of universal necessity diodorus as cicero informs us in his book de fato cap vii held this opinion id solum fieri posse quod aut verum sit aut futurum sit verum at quicquid futurum sit id dicit fieri necesse esse et quicquid non sit futurum id negat fieri posse that is he maintained there is nothing contingent in future events nothing possible to happen but that precise event which will happen this no doubt was carrying their system its due length though in this way of speaking there is something that manifestly shocks the natural feelings of mankind chrysippus on the other hand sensible of the harshness of the above consequence maintained that it is possible for future events to happen otherways than in fact they happen in this he was certainly inconsistent with his general system of necessity and therefore as cicero gives us to understand was often embarassed in the dispute with diodorus and plutarch in his book de repugnantiis stoicorum exposes him for this inconsistency but chrysippus chose to follow his natural feelings in opposition to philosophy holding by this that diodoruss doctrine of nothing being possible but what happens was ignava ratio tending to absolute inaction cui si pareamus as cicero expresses it nihil omnino agamus in vita so early were philosophers sensible of the difficulty of reconciling speculation with feeling as to this doctrine of fate   what then shall be done in this case where truth contradicts the common feelings and natural notions of mankind where it presents to us with irresistible evidence a system of universal necessity upon which we never act but are so formed as to conduct ourselves by a system of notions quite opposite shall we sacrifice abstract truth to feeling or shall we stand by truth and force our feelings into compliance neither of these will do truth is too rigid to bend to mere feeling and our feelings are incapable of being forced by speculation the attempt is vain pugnantia secum frontibus adversis componere let us be honest then let us fairly own that the truth of things is on the side of necessity but that it was necessary for man to be formed with such feelings and notions of contingency as would fit him for the part he has to act this thought requires illustration  the deity is the first cause of all things he formed in his infinite mind the great plan or scheme upon which all things were to be governed and put it in execution by establishing certain laws both in the natural and moral world which are fixed and immutable by virtue of these laws all things proceed in a regular train of causes and effects bringing about those events which are comprehended in the original plan and admitting the possibility of none other this universe is a vast machine winded up and set a going the several springs and wheels act unerringly one upon another the hand advances and the clock strikes precisely as the artist has determined whoever has just ideas and a true taste of philosophy will see this to be the real theory of the universe and that upon any other theory there can be no general order no whole no plan no means nor end in its administration in this plan man a rational creature was to bear his part and to fulfill certain ends for which he was designed he was to appear as an actor and to act with consciousness and spontaneity he was to exercise thought and reason and to receive the improvements of his nature by the due use of these rational powers consequently it was necessary that he should have some idea of liberty some feeling of things possible and contingent things depending upon himself to cause that he might be led to a proper exercise of that activity for which he was designed to have had his instinctive feelings his practical ideas formed upon the scheme of universal necessity to have seen himself a part of that great machine winded up and set a going by the author of his nature would have been altogether incongruous to the ends he was to fulfill then indeed the ignava ratio the inactive doctrine of the stoics would have followed conceiving nothing to be contingent or depending upon himself to cause there would have been no room for forethought about futurity nor for any sort of industry and care he would have had no motives to action but immediate sensations of pleasure and pain he must have been formed like the brutes who have no other principle of action but mere instinct the few instincts he is at present endowed with would have been altogether insufficient he must have had an instinct to sow another to reap he must have had instincts to pursue every convenience and perform every office of life in short reason and thought could not have been exercised in the way they are that is man could not have been man had he not been furnished with a feeling of contingency in this as in all things else the divine wisdom and goodness are most admirable as in the natural world the almighty has adapted our senses not to the discovery of the intimate nature and essences of things but to the uses and conveniences of life as he has in several instances exhibited natural objects to us not in their real but in a sort of artificial view clothed with such distinctions and producing such sensations as are for the benefit of man so he has exhibited the intellectual world to us in a like artificial view clothed with certain colors and distinctions imaginary but useful life is conducted according to this artificial view of things and by our speculations is not in the least affected let the philosopher meditate in his closet upon abstract truth let him be ever so much convinced of the settled necessary train of causes and effects which leaves nothing properly speaking in his power yet the moment he comes forth into the world he acts as a free agent and what is wonderful though in this he acts upon a false supposition yet he is not thereby misled from the ends of action but on the contrary fulfills them to the best advantage long experience has made him sensible that some things such as the suns rising and setting depend upon immutable laws this is contradicted by no feeling as it is no way for his benefit that he should act upon any other supposition such things he reckons upon as necessary but there are other things which depend upon the spontancous choices of men or upon a concurrence of natural and moral causes as to these he has not knowledge enough to foresee and determine by what law they will happen and his ignorance of the event is made to have the same effect upon his mind as if the event were what we vulgarly call contingent its uncertainty as to him produces the same feeling and stirs him up to the same activity as if it were uncertain in itself and had no determined cause of its futurition this feeling then of contingency and all the ideas connected with it may be treated as secondary qualities which have no real existence in things but like other secondary qualities are made to appear as existing in events or belonging to them in order to serve the necessary purposes of human life  some objections shall be considered after discussing the other branch of the disquisition concerning liberty of action these subjects are so closely connected that they cannot fail to throw light upon each other contingency in events is analogous to liberty in actions the one is a supposed quality of the thing the other of the actor  the extent of human liberty is above ascertained it consists in spontaneity or acting according to our inclination and choice it may be therefore distinguished from constraint but must not be opposed to necessity for as has been fully shown the mind in the most calm choice the most deliberate action is necessarily i e unavoidably and certainly determined by the prepollent motive when we examine accurately how far our feelings correspond to this system we find as was hinted before first that antecedent to any particular action we generally think and reason upon the scheme of necessity in considering or guessing at future events we always conclude that a man will act consistently with his character we infer what his actions will be from the knowledge we have of his temper and the motives that are fitted to influence it and never dream of any mans having a power of acting against motives here we have a very weak feeling if any at all of liberty as distinguished from necessity and wisely so ordered that a clue as it were might be afforded to guide us in the labyrinth of future actions which were it not for the connection betwixt an action and its motive would appear like a rope of sand loose and unconnected and no means left of reasoning upon or foreseeing future actions it is to be observed in the next place that during the action the feeling begins to vary and unless in cases where the motive is so strong and overbearing as to approach to the nature of constraint unless in these a man has a feeling of liberty or of a power of acting otherways than he is doing but in the third place it is principally in reflecting and passing judgment upon a past action that the feeling of liberty is sensible and strong then it is that our actions are not considered as proceeding in a necessary unavoidable train but we accuse and blame others for not having acted the part they might and ought to have acted and condemn ourselves and feel remorse for having been guilty of a wrong we might have refrained from the operations of moral conscience plainly proceed upon this supposition that there is such a power in man of directing his actions as rendered it possible for the person accused to have acted a better part this affords an argument which the advocates for liberty have urged in its full force against the doctrine of necessity they reason thus if actions be necessary and not in our own power and if we know it to be so what ground can there be for reprehension and blame for selfcondemnation and remorse if a clock had understanding to be sensible of its own motions knowing at the same time that they proceed according to necessary laws could it find fault with itself for striking wrong would it not blame the artist who had ill adjusted the wheels on which its movements depended so that upon this scheme say they all the moral constitution of our nature is overturned there is an end to all the operations of conscience about right and wrong man is no longer a moral agent nor the subject of praise or blame for what he does  this difficulty is great and never has been surmounted by the advocates for necessity they endeavor to surmount it by reconciling feeling to philosophic truth in the following manner we are so constituted they say that certain affections and the actions which proceed from them appear odious and base and others agreeable and lovely that wherever they are beheld either in ourselves or others the moral sense necessarily approves of the one and condemns the other that this approbation is immediate and instinctive without any reflection on the liberty or necessity of actions that on the contrary the more any person is under the power of his affections and passions and by consequence the greater necessity he is under the more virtuous or vicious he is esteemed  but this account of the matter is not satisfactory all that is here said is in the main true but is not the whole truth i appeal to any man who has been guilty of a bad action which gives him uneasiness whether there is not somewhat more in the inward feeling than merely a dislike or disapprobation of the affection from which his action proceeded whether the pain the cruciatus of remorfe is not founded on the notion of a power he has over his will and actions that he might have forborne to do the ill thing and whether it is not upon this account that he is galled within angry at himself and confesses himself to be justly blameable an uneasiness somewhat of the same kind is felt upon the reflection of any foolish or rash action committed against the rules of wisdom the sting is indeed much sharper and for very wise reasons when a man has trespassed against the rules of strict morality but in both cases the uneasiness proceeds upon the supposition that he was free and had it in his power to have acted a better part this indeed is true that to be so entirely under the power of any bad passion lust for instance or cruelty as to be incapable of acting otherways than they direct constitutes a very hateful character i admit that all such ill affections are naturally and in themselves the objects of dislike and hatred wherever they are beheld but i insist upon it that mere dislike and hatred are not the whole but only a part of the moral feeling the person thus under the dominion of bad passions is accused is condemned singly upon this ground that it was through his own fault he became so subject to them in other words that it was in his power to have kept his mind free from the enslaving influence of corrupt affections were not this the case brute animals might be the objects of moral blame as well as man some beasts are reckoned savage and cruel others treacherous and false we dislike we hate creatures so ill constituted but we do not blame nor condemn them as we do rational agents because they are not supposed to have a sense of right and wrong nor freedom and power of directing their actions according to that inward rule we must therefore admit that the idea of freedom of a power of regulating our will and actions according to certain rules is essential to the moral feeling on the system of universal necessity abstracted from this feeling though certain affections and actions might excite our approbation and others our dislike there could be no place for blame or remorse all the ideas would entirely vanish which at present are suggested by the words ought and should when applied to moral conduct  here then is another instance of a natural feeling opposed to philosophic truth analogous to what is before considered it is the more remarkable that it has given rise to those disputes about liberty and necessity which have subsisted through all ages in the inquiring world which since the earliest accounts of philosophy have run through all different sects of philosophers and have been ingrafted into most of the religious systems we are now able i imagine to give a clear and satisfactory account why the different parties never could agree because in truth the feeling of liberty which we have does not agree with the real fact those who were boldest in their inquiries traced out the philosophic truth they saw that all things proceeded in a necessary train of causes and effects which rendered it impossible for them to act otherways than they did and to this system they adhered without yielding to natural feelings those again who had not courage to oppose the first and most obvious feelings of their heart stopped short and adhered to liberty it is observable that the side of liberty has always been the most popular and most generally embraced and upon this system all popular discourses and exhortations must needs proceed even those persons whose philosophical tenets are built upon the system of necessity find themselves obliged to desert that system in popular argument and to adopt the style and language of those who espouse liberty among the ancients the great assertors of necessity were the stoics a severe and rigid sect whose professed doctrine it was to subdue all our feelings to philosophy the platonics academics and epicureans who embraced a softer scheme of philosophy and were more men of the world than the stoics leaned to the side of liberty both parties have their own advantages in reasoning and both when pushed run into difficulties from which they can never extricate themselves the advocates for liberty talk with great advantage upon the moral powers of man and his character as an accountable being but are at a loss how to give any view of the universe as a regular preadjusted plan and when urged with the connection betwixt the motive and the action and the necessary train of causes and effects which results from admitting it to be a fixed connection they find themselves greatly embarrassed here the patrons of necessity triumph they have manifestly all the advantages of speculative argument whilst they fail in accounting for mans moral powers and struggle in vain to reconcile to their system the testimony which conscience clearly gives to freedom  let us then fairly acknowledge concerning both these classes of philosophers that they were partly in the right and partly in the wrong they divided as it were the truth betwixt them the one had abstract reason on their side the other had natural feeling in endeavoring to reconcile these opposites both parties failed and the vain attempt has rendered the controversy difficult and perplexed after having ascertained the foundation upon which the doctrine of necessity is built and which seems incapable of being shaken let us fairly and heartily take our nature as we find it which will lead us to this conclusion that though man in truth is a necessary agent having all his actions determined by fixed and immutable laws yet that this being concealed from him he acts with the conviction of being a free agent it is concealed from him i say as to the purposes of action for whatever discoveries he makes as a philosopher these affect not his conduct as a man in principle and speculation let him be a most rigid fatalist he has nevertheless all the feelings which would arise from power over his own actions he is angry at himself when he has done wrong he praises and blames just like other men nor can all his principles set him above the reach of selfcondemnation and remorse when conscience at any time smites him it is true that a man of this belief when he is seeking to make his mind easy after some bad action may reason upon the principles of necessity that according to the constitution of his nature it was impossible for him to have acted any other part but this will give him little relief in spite of all reasonings his remorse will subsist nature never intended us to act upon this plan and our natural principles are too deeply rooted to give way to philosophy this case is precisely similar to that of contingency a feeling of liberty which i now scruple not to call deceitful is so interwoven with our nature that it has an equal effect in action as if we were really endued with such a power  having explained at full length this remarkable feeling of liberty and examined as we went along some arguments against necessity that are founded upon it we now proceed to handle this feeling as we have done that of contingency with regard to its final cause and in this branch of our nature are displayed the greatest wisdom and the greatest goodness man must be so constituted in order to attain the proper improvement of his nature in virtue and happiness put the case he were entirely divested of his present ideas of liberty suppose him to see and conceive his own nature and the constitution of things in the light of strict philosophic truth in the same light they are beheld by the deity to conceive himself and all his actions necessarily linked into the great chain of causes and effects which renders the whole order both of the natural and moral world unalterably determined in every article suppose i say our natural feelings our practical ideas to suit and tally with this which is the real plan and what would follow why an entire derangement of our present system of action especially with regard to the motives which now lead us to virtue there would still indeed be ground for the love of virtue as the best constitution of nature and the only sure foundation of happiness and in this view we might be grieved when we found ourselves deficient in good principles but this would be all we could feel no inward selfapprobation on doing well no remorse on doing ill because both the good and the ill were necessary and unavoidable there would be no more place for applause or blame among mankind none of that generous indignation we now feel at the bad as persons who have abused and perverted their rational powers no more notion of accountableness for the use of those powers no sense of ill desert or just punishment annexed to crimes as their due nor of any reward merited by worthy and generous actions all these ideas and feelings so useful to men in their moral conduct vanish at once with the feeling of liberty there would be field for no other passions but love and hatred sorrow and pity and the sense of duty of being obliged to certain things which we ought to perform must be quite extinguished for we can have no conception of moral obligation without supposing a power in the agent over his own actions  it appears then most fit and wise that we should be endued with a sense of liberty without which man must have been ill qualified for acting his present part that artificial light in which the feeling of liberty presents the moral world to our view answers all the good purposes of making the actions of man entirely dependent upon himself his happiness and misery appear to be in his own power he appears praiseworthy or culpable according as he improves or neglects his rational faculties the idea of his being an accountable crearure arises reward seems due to merit punishment to crimes he feels the force of moral obligation in short new passions arise and a variety of new springs are set in motion to make way for new exertions of reason and activity in all which though man is really actuated by laws of necessary influence yet he seems to move himself and whilst the universal system is gradually carried on to perfection by the first mover that powerful hand which winds up and directs the great machine is never brought into sight  it will now be proper to answer some objections which may be urged against the doctrine we have advanced one which at first may seem of considerable weight is that we found virtue altogether upon a deceitful feeling of liberty which it may be alleged is neither a secure nor an honorable foundation but in the first place i deny that we have founded it altogether upon a deceitful feeling for independent of the deceitful feeling of liberty there is in the nature of man a firm foundation for virtue he must be sensible that virtue is essentially preferable to vice that it is the just order the perfection and happiness of his nature for supposing him only endued with the principle of selflove this principle will lead him to distinguish moral good from evil so far as to give ground for loving the one and hating the other as he must needs see that benevolence justice temperance and the other virtues are the necessary means of his happiness and that all vice and wickedness introduce disorder and misery but man is endued with a social as well as a selfish principle and has an immediate satisfaction and pleasure in the happiness of others which is a further ground for distinguishing and loving virtue all this i say takes place laying aside the deceitful feeling of liberty and supposing all our notions to be adjusted to the system of necessity i add that there is nothing in the above doctrine to exclude the perception of a certain beauty and excellency in virtue according to lord shaftesbury and the ancient philosophers which may for ought we know render it lovely and admirable to all rational beings it appears to us unquestionably under the form of intrinsic excellency even when we think not of its tendency to our happiness ideas of moral obligation of remorse of merit and all that is connected with this way of thinking arise from what may be called a wise delusion in our nature concerning liberty but as this affects only a certain modification of our ideas of virtue and vice there is nothing in it to render the foundation of virtue either unsecure or dishonorable unsecure it does not render it because as now observed virtue partly stands firm upon a separate foundation independent of these feelings and even where built upon these feelings it is still built upon human nature for though these feelings of liberty vary from the truth of things they are nevertheless essential to the nature of man we act upon them and cannot act otherways and therefore though the distinction betwixt virtue and vice had no other foundation but these feelings which is not the case it would still have an immovable and secure foundation in human nature as for the supposed dishonor done to virtue by resting its authority in any degree on a deceitful feeling there is so little ground for this part of the objection that on the contrary our doctrine most highly exalts virtue for the above described artificial sense of liberty is wholly contrived to support virtue and to give its dictates the force of a law hereby it is discovered to be in a singular manner the care of the deity and a peculiar sort of glory is thrown around it the author of nature has not rested it upon the ordinary feelings and principles of human nature as he has rested our other affections and appetites even those which are most necessary to our existence but a sort of extraordinary machinery is introduced for its sake human nature is forced as it were out of its course and made to receive a nice and artificial set of feelings merely that conscience may have a commanding power and virtue be set as on a throne this could not otherways be brought about but by means of the deceitful feeling of liberty which therefore is a greater honor to virtue a higher recommendation of it than if our conceptions were in every particular correspondent to the truth of things  a second objection which may be urged against our system is that it seems to represent the deity as acting deceitfully by his creatures he has given them certain ideas of contingency in events and of liberty in their own actions by which he has in a manner forced them to act upon a false hypothesis as if he were unable to carry on the government of this world did his creatures conceive things according to the real truth this objection is in a great measure obviated by what we observed in the introduction to this essay concerning our sensible ideas it is universally allowed by modern philosophers that the perceptions of our external senses are not always agreeable to strict truth but so contrived as rather to answer the purposes of use now if it be called a deceit in our senses not to give us just representations of the material world the deity must be the author of this deceit as much as he is of that which prevails in our moral ideas but no just objection can ly against the conduct of the deity in either ease our senses both internal and external are given us for different ends and purposes some to discover truth others to make us happy and virtuous the senses which are appropriated to the discovery of truth unerringly answer their end so do the senses which are appropriated to virtue and happiness and in this view it is no material objection that the same sense does not answer both ends as to the other part of the objection that it must imply imperfection in the deity if he cannot establish virtue but upon a delusive foundation we may be satisfied how fallacious this reasoning is by reflecting upon the numberless appearances of moral evil and disorder in this world from these appearances much more strongly were there any force in this reasoning might we infer imperfection in the deity seeing the state of this world in many particulars does not answer the notions we are apt to form of supreme power conducted by perfect wisdom and goodness but in truth there is nothing in our doctrine which can justly argue imperfection in the deity for it is abundantly plain first that it is a more perfect state of things and more worthy of the deity to have all events going on with unbroken order in a fixed train of causes and effects than to have every thing desultory and contingent and if such a being as man was to be placed in this world to act his present part it was necessary that he should have a notion of contingency in events and of liberty in his own actions the objection therefore on the whole amounts to no more than that the deity cannot work contradictions for if it was fit and wise that man should think and act as a free agent it was impossible this could be otherways accomplished than by endowing him with a sense of liberty and if it was also fit and wise that universal necessity should be the real plan of the universe this sense of liberty could be no other than a deceitful one  another objection may perhaps be raised against us in this form if it was necessary for man to be constituted with such an artificial feeling why was he endowed with so much knowledge as to unravel the mystery what purpose does it serve to let in just so much light as to discover the disguised appearance of the moral world when it was intended that his conduct should be adjusted to this disguised appearance to this i answer first that the discovery when made cannot possibly be of any bad consequence and next that a good consequence of very great importance results from it no bad consequence i say ensues from the discovery that liberty and contingency are deceitful feelings for the case is confessedly parallel in the natural world where no harm has ensued after we have discovered by philosophy that several of the appearances of nature are only useful illusions that secondary qualities exist not in matter and that our sensible ideas in various instances do not correspond to philosophic truth after these discoveries are made do they in the least affect even the philosopher himself in ordinary action does not he in common with the rest of mankind proceed as it is fit he should upon the common system of appearances and natural feelings as little in the present case do our speculations about liberty and necessity counteract the plan of nature upon the system of liberty we do and must act and no discoveries made concerning the illusive nature of that feeling are capable of disappointing in any degree the intention of the deity  but this is not all these discoveries are also of excellent use as they furnish us with one of the strongest arguments for the existence of the deity and as they set the wisdom and goodness of his providence in the most striking light nothing carries in it more express characters of design nothing can be conceived more opposite to chance than a plan so artfully contrived for adjusting our impressions and feelings to the purposes of life for here things are carried off as it were from the straight line taken out of the course in which they would of themselves proceed and so molded as forcibly and against their nature to be subservient to man his mind does not receive the impression of the moral world in the same manner as wax receives the impression of a seal it does not reflect the image of it in the same manner as a mirror reflects its images it has a peculiar cast and turn given to its conceptions admirably ordered to exalt virtue to the highest pitch these conceptions are indeed illusive yet which is wonderful it is by this very circumstance that in man two of the most opposite things in nature are happily reconciled liberty and necessity having this illustrious effect that in him are accumulated all the prerogatives both of a necessary and free agent the discovery of such a marvelous adjustment which is more directly opposed to chance than any other thing conceiveable must necessarily give us the strongest impression of a wise designing cause and now a sufficient reason appears for suffering man to make this surprising discovery the almighty has let us so far into his councils as to afford the justest foundation for admiring and adoring his wisdom it is a remark worthy to be made that the capacities of man seem in general to have a tendency beyond the wants and occasions of his present state this has been often observed with respect to his wishes and desires the same holds as to his intellectual faculties which sometimes as in the instance before us run beyond the limits of what is strictly necessary for him to know in his present circumstances and let in upon him some glimmerings of higher and nobler discoveries a veil is thrown over nature where it is not useful for him to behold it and yet sometimes by turning aside that veil a very little he is admitted to a fuller view that his admiration of nature and the god of nature may be increased that his curiosity and love of truth may be fed and perhaps that some augurium some intimation may be given of his being designed for a future more exalted period of being when attaining the full maturity of his nature he shall no longer stand in need of artificial impressions but shall feel and act according to the strictest truth of things  essays upon the principles of morality and natural religion  part ii  essay i of belief belief is a term so familiar as to have escaped the inquiry of all philosophers except the author of the treatise of human nature and yet the subject is by no means so plain as to admit of no doubts nor difficulties this author has made two propositions sufficiently evident first that belief is not any separate action or perception of the mind but a modification of our perceptions or a certain manner of conceiving propositions  d that it does not accompany every one of our perceptions a man in some circumstances sees objects double but he does not believe them to be double he can form the idea of a golden mountain he can form the idea of it as of a certain size and as existing in a certain place but he does not believe it to be existing  having proved that belief is not a separate perception but only a modification of some perceptions our author goes on to explain the nature of this modification and his doctrine is that belief making no alteration upon the idea as to its parts and composition must consist in the lively manner of conceiving the idea and that in reality a lively idea and belief are the same i have a high opinion of this authors acuteness and penetration but no authority can prevail with me to embrace such a doctrine for at this rate credulity and a lively imagination would be always connected which does not hold in fact poetry and painting produce lively ideas but they seldom produce belief for my part i have no difficulty to form as lively a conception of cesars dying in his bed descanting upon the vanity of ambition or dictating rules of government to his successor as of his being put to death in the senate house nothing is told with more vivacity than the death of cyrus in a pitched battle with the queen of the scythians who dipped his head as we are told in a vessel full of blood saying satiate thyself with blood of which thou wast ever thirsty yet upon comparing circumstances and authors the more probable opinion is that cyrus died in his bed  it may be observed at the same time that the conclusion is very lame which this author draws from his premises belief makes no alteration upon the idea as to its parts and composition it can only therefore consist in a modification of the idea but does it follow that it consists in a lively conceptition of the idea which is but one of many modifications there is not here the shadow of an inference  our author indeed urges that true history takes fast hold of the mind and presents its objects in a more lively manner than any fabulous narration can do every man must judge for himself i cannot admit this to be my case history no doubt takes faster hold of the mind than any fiction told in the plain historical style but can any man doubt who has not an hypothesis to defend that poetry makes a stronger impression than history let a man if he has feelings attend the celebrated garrick in the character of richard or in that of king lear and he will find that dramatic representations make strong and lively impressions which history seldom comes up to  but now if it shall be supposed that history presents its objects in a more lively manner than can be done by dramatic or epic poetry it will not therefore follow that a lively idea is the same with belief i read a passage in virgil let it be the episode of nisus and euryalus i read a passage in livy sciz the sacking of rome by the gauls if i have a more lively idea of the latter story i put it to my author to point out the cause of this effect he surely will not affirm that it is the force of expression or harmony of numbers for in these particulars the historian cannot be compared to the poet it is evident that no other satisfactory account of the matter can be given but this that livys superior influence upon the imagination is the effect of his being considered as a true historian the most then that our author can make of his observation supposing it to hold true in fact is that the authority of the historian produces belief and that belief produces a more lively idea than any fabulous narration can do the truth of the matter is that belief and a lively conception are really two distinct modifications of the idea which though often conjoined are not only separable in the imagination but in fact are often separated truth indeed bestows a certain degree of vivacity upon our ideas at the same time i cannot admit that history exceeds dramatic or epic poetry in conveying a lively conception of facts because it appears evident that in works of imagination the want of truth is more than compensated by sentiment and language  sometimes indeed belief is the result of a lively impression a dramatic representation is one instance when it affects us so much as to draw off the attention from every other object and even from ourselves in this situation we dont consider the actor but conceive him to be the very man whose character he assumes we have that very man before our eyes we perceive him as existing and acting and believe him to be existing and acting this belief however is but momentary it vanishes like a dream so soon as we are rouzed by any trivial circumstance to a consciousness of ourselves and of the place we are in nor is the lively impression even in this case the cause of belief but only the occasion of it by diverting the attention of the mind from itself and its situation it is in some such manner that the idea of a spectre in the dark which fills the mind and diverts it from itself is by the force of imagination converted into a reality we think we see and hear it we are convinced of it and believe the matter to be so  rejecting therefore this authors opinion the real truth appears to be this there is a certain peculiar manner of perceiving objects and conceiving propositions which being a simple feeling cannot be described but is expressed by the word belief the causes of this modification termed belief are the authority of my own senses and the authority of others who either relate facts upon the authority of their senses or what they have heard at second or third hand so that belief mediately or immediately is founded upon the authority of our senses we are so constituted by nature as to put trust in our senses nor in general is it in our power to disbelieve our senses they have authority with us irresistible there is but one exception that i can think of finding by experience that we have been sometimes led into an error by trusting some particular perceptions the remembrance of these instances counterbalances the authority of our perception in the like cases and either keeps the mind suspended or perhaps makes it rest in a conviction that the perception is erroneous  with regard to the evidence of my own senses though i cannot admit that the essence of belief consists in the vivacity of the impression i so far agree with our author that vivacity and belief in this case are always conjoined a mountain i have once seen i believe to be existing though i am a thousand miles from it and the image or idea i have of that mountain is more lively and more distinct than of any i can form merely by the force of imagination but this is far from being the case as above observed of ideas raised in my mind by the force of language  belief arising from the evidence of others rests upon a different foundation veracity and a disposition to believe are corresponding principles in the nature of man and in the main these principles are so adjusted that men are not often deceived the disposition we have to believe is qualified by the opinion we have of the witness and the nature of the story he relates but supposing a concurrence of all other circumstances to prompt our belief yet if the speaker pretends only to amuse without confining himself to truth his narration will not in the smallest degree prompt our belief let him enliven it with the strongest colors that poetry is master of  i have only to add that though our own senses and the testimony of others are the proper causes of belief yet that these causes are more or less efficacious according to the temper of mind we are in at the time hope and fear are influenced by passion so is belief hope and fear are modifications of our conception of future events if the event be agreeable and the probability of its existence be great our conception of its existence takes on a modification which is called hope if the event be extremely agreeable and the probability of its existing do greatly preponderate our hope is increased proportionally and sometimes is converted into a firm belief that it will really happen upon weak minds the delightfulness of the expected event will of itself have that effect the imagination fired with the prospect augments the probability till it convert it to a firm persuasion or belief on the other hand if fear get the ascendent by a conceived improbability of the existence of the event the mind desponds and fear is converted into a firm belief that the event will not happen the operations of the mind are quite similar where the event in view is disagreeable  essay ii of the idea of self and of personal identity had we no original impressions but those of the external senses according to the author of the treatise of human nature we never could have any consciousness of self because such consciousness cannot arise from any external sense mankind would be in a perpetual reverie ideas would be constantly floating in the mind and no man be able to connect his ideas with himself neither could there be any idea of personal identity for a man cannot consider himself to be the same person in different circumstances when he has no idea or consciousness of himself at all  beings there may be who are thus constituted but man is none of these beings it is an undoubted truth that he has an original feeling or consciousness of himself and of his existence which for the most part accompanies every one of his impressions and ideas and every action of his mind and body i say for the most part for the faculty or internal sense which is the cause of this peculiar perception is not always in action in a dead sleep we have no consciousness of self we dream sometimes without this consciousness and even some of our waking hours pass without it a reverie is nothing else but a wandering of the mind through its ideas without carrying along the perception of self  this consciousness or perception of self is at the same time of the liveliest kind selfpreservation is every ones peculiar duty and the vivacity of this perception is necessary to make us attentive to our own interest and particularly to shun every appearance of danger when a man is in a reverie he has no circumspection nor any manner of attention to his own interest  it is remarkable that one has scarce any chance to fall asleep till this perception vanish its vivacity keeps the mind in a certain degree of agitation which bars sleep a fall of water disposes to sleep it fixes the attention both by sound and sight and without creating much agitation occupies the mind so as to make it forget itself reading of some books has the same effect  it is this perception or consciousness of self carried through all the different stages of life and all the variety of action which is the foundation of personal identity it is by means of this perception that i consider myself to be the same person in all varieties of fortune and every change of circumstance  the main purpose of this short essay is to introduce an observation that it is not by any argument or reasoning i conclude myself to be the same person i was ten years ago this conclusion rests entirely upon the feeling of identity which accompanies me through all my changes and which is the only connecting principle that binds together all the various thoughts and actions of my life far less is it by any argument or chain of reasoning that i discover my own existence it would be strange indeed if every mans existence was kept a secret from him till the celebrated argument was invented that cogito ergo sum and if a fact that to common understanding appears selfevident is not to be relied on without an argument why should i take for granted without an argument that i think more than that i exist for surely i am not more conscious of thinking than of existing  upon this subject i shall just suggest a thought which will be more fully insisted on afterward that any doctrine which leads to a distrust of our senses must land in universal skepticism if natural feelings whether from internal or external senses are not admitted as evidence of truth i cannot see that we can be certain of any fact whatever it is clear from what is now observed that upon this skeptical system we cannot be certain even of our own existence the deceitful feeling of liberty unfolded in the essay upon liberty and necessity may perhaps embarrass some readers as in some measure contradictory to the position here laid down but the matter is easily cleared natural feelings are satisfying evidence of truth and in fact have full authority over us unless in some singular cases where we are admonished by counterfeelings or by reasoning not to give implicit trust this is a sufficient foundation for all the arguments that are built upon the authority of our senses in point of evidence the feeling of liberty is a very singular case the reasons are clearly traced for the necessity of this delusive feeling which distinguishes it in a very particular manner and leaves no room to draw any consequence from it to our other feelings but there is besides a circumstance yet more distinguishing in this delusive feeling of liberty which entirely exempts it from being an exception to the general rule above laid down it is this that the feeling is by no means entire on the side of liberty it is counterbalanced by other feelings which in many instances afford such a conviction of the necessary influence of motives that physical and moral necessity can scarce be distinguished the sense of liberty operates chiefly in the after reflection but previous to the action there is no distinct or clear feeling that it can happen otherways than in connection with its proper motive here the feelings being on the whole opposite to each other nothing can be inferred from this case to derogate from the evidence of feelings that are clear cogent and authoritative and to which nothing can be opposed from the side of reason or counterfeelings so that our principle remains safe and unshaken that a general distrust of our senses internal or external must land us in universal skepticism   essay iii of the authority of our senses in a former essay are pointed out some instances in which our senses may be called deceitful essay upon liberty and necessity  they are of two sorts one is when the deception is occasioned by indisposition of the organ remoteness of place grossness of the medium or the like which distort the appearances of objects and make them be seen double or greater or less than they really are in such instances the perception is always faint obscure or confused and they noway invalidate the authority of the senses in general when abstracting from such accidental obstructions the perception is lively strong and distinct in the other sort there is a deception established by the laws of nature as in the case of secondary qualities taken notice of in that essay whence it was inferred that nature does not always give us such correct perceptions as correspond to the philosophic truth of things notwithstanding of which the testimony of our senses still remains as a sufficient ground of confidence and trust for in all these cases where there is this sort of established deception nature furnishes means for coming at the truth as in this very instance of secondary qualities philosophy easily corrects the false appearances and teaches us that they are rather to be considered as impressions made upon the mind than as qualities of the object a remedy being thus provided to the deception our belief so far as it can be influenced by reason is the more confirmed with regard to our other sensations where there is no appearance of illusion but this is not the whole of the matter when any sense presents to our view an appearance that may be called deceitful we plainly discover some useful purpose intended the deceit is not the effect of an imperfect or arbitrary constitution but wisely contrived to give us such notice of things as may best suit the purposes of life from this very consideration we are the more confirmed in the veracity of nature particular instances in which our senses are accommodated to the uses of life rather than to the strictness of truth are rational exceptions which serve the more firmly to establish the general rule and indeed when we have nothing but our senses to direct our conduct with regard to external objects it would be strange if there should be any just ground for a general distrust of them but there is no such thing there is nothing to which all mankind are more necessarily determined than to put confidence in their senses we entertain no doubt of their authority because we are so constituted that it is not in our power to doubt  when the authority of our senses is thus founded on the necessity of our nature and confirmed by constant experience it cannot but appear strange that it should come into the thought of any man to call it in question but the influence of novelty is great and when a bold genius in spite of common sense and common feelings will strike out new paths to himself it is not easy to foresee how far his airy metaphysical notions may carry him a late author who gives us a treatise concerning the principles of human knowledge by denying the reality of external objects strikes at the root of the authority of our senses and thereby paves the way to the most inveterate skepticism for what reliance can we have upon our senses if they deceive us in a point so material if we can be prevailed upon to doubt of the reality of external objects the next step will be to doubt of what passes in our own minds of the reality of our ideas and perceptions for we have not a stronger consciousness nor a clearer conviction of the one than of the other and the last step will be to doubt of our own existence for it is shown in the essay immediately foregoing that we have no certainty of this fact but what depends upon sense and feeling  it is reported that doctor berkeley the author of the abovementioned treatise was moved to adopt this whimsical opinion to get free of some arguments urged by materialists against the existence of the deity if so he has been unhappy in his experiment for this doctrine if it should not lead to universal skepticism affords at least a shrewd argument in favors of atheism if i can only be conscious of what passes in my own mind and if i cannot trust my senses when they give me notice of external and independent existences it follows that i am the only being in the world at least that i can have no evidence from my senses of any other being body or spirit this is certainly an unwary concession because it deprives us of our principal or only inlet to the knowledge of the deity laying aside sense and feeling this learned divine will find it a difficult task to point out by what other means it is that we make the discovery of the above important truth but of this more afterward  were there nothing else in view but to establish the reality of external objects it would be scarce worth while to bestow much thought in solving metaphysical paradoxes against their existence which are better confuted by common sense and experience but as the above doctrine appears to have very extensive consequences and to strike at the root of the most valuable branches of human knowledge an attempt to reestablish the authority of our senses by detecting the fallacy of the arguments that have been urged against it may it is hoped not be unacceptable to the public the attempt at any rate is necessary in this work the main purpose of which is to show that our senses external and internal are the true sources from whence the knowledge of the deity is derived to us  in order to afford satisfaction upon a subject which is easier felt than expressed it will be proper to give a distinct analysis of the operations of those senses by which we perceive external objects and if this be once clearly apprehended it will not be a matter of difficulty to answer the several objections which have been urged against their existence  the impressions of the external senses are of different kinds some we have at the organs of sense such as smelling tasting touching some are made upon us as from a distance such as hearing and seeing from the sense of feeling are derived the impressions of body solidity and external existence laying my hand upon this table i perceive a thing smooth and hard pressing upon my hand and which is perceived as more distant from me than my hand is from the sight we have the impressions of motion and of color and from the sight as well as from the touch those of extension and figure but it is more material to observe upon the present subject that from sight as well as touch we have the impression of things as having an independent and continued or permanent existence  let us endeavor to explain this modification of independency and permanent existence of the objects of sight and touch for it is a cardinal point to begin with the objects of sight i cast my eye upon a tree and perceive color figure extention and sometimes motion if this be a complete analysis of the perception substance is not discoverable by sight but upon attentively examining this perception to try if there be any thing more in it i find one circumstance omitted that the above particulars are not perceived as so many separate existences having no relation to each other but as closely united and connected when looking around on different objects i perceive color in one quarter motion in a second and extension in a third the appearance these make in my mind are in nothing similar to the impression made by a tree where the extension motion and other qualities are introduced into the mind under the modification of an intimate connection and union but in what manner are they united and connected of this every person can give an account that they are perceived as inhering in or belonging to some substance or thing of which they are qualities and that by their reference to this substance or thing they are thus closely united and connected thus it is that the impression of substance as well as of qualities is derived from sight and it is also to be attended to as a part of the total impression that as the qualities appear to belong to their substance and to inhere in it so both the substance and its qualities which we call the tree are perceived as altogether independent of us as really existing and as having a permanent existence  a similar impression is made upon us by means of the sense of feeling it is observed above that from the touch we have the impressions of body solidity and external existence and we have from the same sense the impressions of softness and hardness smoothness and roughness now when i lay my hand upon this table i have an impression not only of smoothness hardness figure and extension but also of a thing i call body of which the above are perceived as qualities smoothness hardness extension and figure are felt not as separate and unconnected existences but as inhering in and belonging to something i call body which is really existing and which has an independent and permanent existence and it is this body with its several qualities which i express by the word table  the above analysis of the impressions of sight and touch will be best illustrated by a comparison with the impressions made by the other senses i hear a sound or i feel a smell attending to these impressions i perceive nothing but sound or smell they are not perceived as the qualities or properties of any body thing or substance they make their appearance in the mind as simple existences and there is no impression made of independency or permanent existence did seeing and feeling carry us no further we never could have the least conception of substance  it is not a little surprising that philosophers who discourse so currently of qualities should affect so much doubt and hesitation about substance seeing these are relative ideas and imply each other for what other reason do we call figure a quality but that we perceive it not as a separate existence but as belonging to something that is figured and which thing we call substance because it is not a property of any other thing but is a thing which subsists by itself or has an independent existence did we perceive figure as we perceive sound it would not be considered as a quality in a word a quality is not intelligible unless upon supposition of some other thing of which it is the quality sounds indeed and smells are also considered as qualities but this proceeds from habit not from original perception for having once acquired the distinction betwixt a thing and its qualities and finding sound and smell more to resemble qualities than substances we readily come into the use of considering them as qualities  another thing is to be observed with regard to those things which are perceived as qualities by the sight and touch that we cannot form a conception of them independent of the beings to which they belong it is not in our power to separate even in imagination color figure motion and extension from body or substance there is no such thing as conceiving motion by itself abstracted from some body which is in motion let us try ever so often our attempts will be in vain to form an idea of a triangle independent of a body which has that figure we cannot conceive a body that is not figured and we can as little conceive a figure without a body for this would be to conceive a figure as having a separate existence at the same time that we conceive it as having no separate existence or to conceive it at once to be a quality and not a quality thus it comes out that substance as well as quality makes a part not only of every perception of sight and touch but of every conception we can form of color figure extension and motion taking in the whole train of our ideas there is not one more familiar to us than that of substance a being or thing which has qualities  when these things are considered i cannot readily discover by what wrong conception of the matter mr lock has been led to talk so obscurely and indistinctly of the idea of substance it is no wonder he should be difficulted to form an idea of substance in general abstracted from all properties when such abstraction is altogether beyond the reach of our conception but there is nothing more easy than to form an idea of any particular substance with its properties yet this has some how escaped him when he forms the idea of a horse or a stone he admits nothing into the idea but a collection of several simple ideas of sensible qualities book  d chap    and because says he we cannot conceive how these qualities should subsist alone nor one in another we suppose them existing in and supported by some common subject which support we denote by the name substance though it be certain we have no clear or distinct idea of that thing we suppose a support a single question would have unfolded the whole mystery how comes it that we cannot conceive qualities to subsist alone nor one in another mr lock himself must have given the following answer that the thing is not conceiveable because a property or quality cannot subsist without the thing to which it belongs for if it did that it would cease to be a property or quality why then does he make so faint an inference as that we suppose qualities existing in and supported by some common subject it is not a bare supposition it is an essential part of the idea it is necessarily suggested to us by sight and touch he observes that we have no clear nor distinct idea of substance if he means that we have no clear nor distinct idea of substance abstracted from its properties the thing is so true that we can form no idea of substance at all abstracted from its properties but it is also true that we can form no idea of properties abstracted from a substance the ideas both of substance and of quality are perfectly in the same condition in this respect which it is surprising philosophers should so little attend to at the same time we have clear and distinct ideas of many things as they exist though perhaps we have not a complete idea of any one thing we have such ideas of things as serve to all the useful purposes of life it is true our senses dont reach beyond the external properties of beings we have no direct perception of the essence and internal properties of any thing these we discover from the effects produced but had we senses directly to perceive the essence and internal properties of things our idea of them would indeed be more full and complete but not more clear and distinct than at present for even upon that supposition we could form no notion of substance but by its properties internal and external to form an idea of a thing abstracted from all its properties is impossible  the following is the sum of what is above laid down by sight and touch we have the impressions of substance and body as well as of qualities it is not figure extension motion that we perceive but a thing figured extended and moving as we cannot form an idea of substance abstracted from qualities so we cannot form an idea of qualities abstracted from substance they are relative ideas and imply each other this is one point gained another is that the idea of substance or body thus attained comprehends in it independent and permanent existence that is something which exists independent of our perceptions and remains the same whether we perceive it or not  in this manner are we made sensible of the real existence of things without us the feeling is so strong and the conviction which makes a part of the feeling that skeptical arguments however cunningly devised may puzzle but can never get the better for such is our constitution that we can entertain no doubt of the authority of our senses in this particular at the same time every sort of experience confirms the truth of our perceptions i see a tree at a distance of a certain shape and size walking forward i find it in its place by the resistance it makes to my body and so far as i can discover by touch it is of the same shape and size which my eye represents it to be i return day after day year after year and find the same object with no other variation but what the seasons and time produce the tree is at last cut down it is no longer to be seen or felt  to overthrow the authority of our senses a few particular instances in which they appear fallacious are of no weight and to confirm this branch of the argument we need but compare the evidence of our senses with the evidence of human testimony the comparison cannot fail to afford satisfaction veracity and a disposition to rely upon human evidence are corresponding principles which greatly promote society among individuals these principles are found to be of different degrees of strength but in the main they are so proportioned to each other that men are not often deceived in this case it would be but a bad argument that we ought not to give credit to any mans testimony because some men are defective in the principle of veracity the only effect such instances have or ought to have is to correct our propensity to believe and to bring on a habit of suspending our belief till circumstances be examined the evidence of our senses rises undoubtedly much higher than the evidence of human testimony and if we continue to put trust in the latter after many instances of being deceived we have better reason to put trust in the former were the instances of being deceived equally numerous which is plainly not the fact when people are in sound health of mind and body they are very seldom misled by their senses  if i have been so lucky as to put this subject in its proper light it will not be a difficult task to clear it of any doubts which may arise upon perusing the above mentioned treatise the author boldly denies the existence of matter and the reality of the objects of sense contending that there is nothing really existing without the mind of an intelligent being in a word reducing all to be a world of ideas it is an opinion strangely prevailing among men says he that houses mountains rivers and in a word all sensible objects have an existence natural or real distinct from their being perceived by the understanding he ventures to call this a manifest contradiction and his argument against the reality of these objects is in the following words the forementioned objects are things perceived by sense we cannot perceive any thing but our own ideas or perceptions therefore what we call men houses mountains etc can be nothing else but ideas or perceptions this argument shall be examined afterward with the respect that is due to its author it shall only be taken notice of by the way that supposing mankind to be under so strange and unaccountable a delusion as to mistake their ideas for men houses mountains etc it will not follow that there is in this any manifest contradiction or any contradiction at all for deception is a very different thing from contradiction but he falls from this high pretension in the after part of his work to argue more consistently that supposing solid figured and moveable substances to exist without the mind yet we could never come to the knowledge of this sect     which is true if our senses bear no testimony of the fact and he adds sect  0  that supposing no bodies to exist without the mind we might have the very same reasons for supposing the existence of external bodies that we have now which may be true supposing only our senses to be fallacious  the doctors fundamental proposition is that we can perceive nothing but our own ideas or perceptions this at best is an ambiguous expression for taking perception or sensation in its proper sense as signifying every object we perceive it is a mere identical proposition sciz that we perceive nothing but what we perceive but taking the doctors proposition as he intended it that we can have no perception or consciousness of any thing but what exists in our own minds he had certainly no reason to take this assertion for granted and yet he has never once attempted a proof of it though in so bold an undertaking as that of annihilating the whole universe his own mind excepted he had no reason to hope that an assertion so singular and so contradictory to common sense and feeling would be taken upon his word it may be true that it is not easy to explain nor even to comprehend by what means we perceive external objects but our ignorance is in most cases a very indifferent argument against matter of fact at this rate he may take upon him equally to deny the bulk of the operations in the natural world which have not hitherto been explained by him or others and at bottom it is perhaps as difficult to explain the manner of perceiving our own ideas or the impressions made upon us as to explain the manner of perceiving external objects the doctor besides ought to have considered that by this bold doctrine he in effect sets bounds to the power of nature or of the author of nature if it was in the power of the almighty to bestow upon man a faculty of perceiving external objects he has certainly done it for supposing the existence of external objects we have no conception how they could be otherways manifested to us than in fact they are therefore the doctor was in the right to assert that a faculty in man to perceive external objects would be a contradiction and consequently a privilege not in the power of the deity to bestow upon him he perceived the necessity of carrying his argument so far at the same time sensible that this was not to be made out he never once attempts to point at any thing like a contradiction and if he cannot prove it to be a contradiction the question is at an end for supposing only the fact to be possible we have the very highest evidence of its reality that our nature is capable of no less than the testimony of our senses  it has been urged in support of the above doctrine that nothing is present to the mind but the impressions made upon it and that it cannot be conscious of any thing but what is present this difficulty is easily solved for the proposition that we cannot be conscious of any thing but what is present to the mind or passes within it is taken for granted as if it were selfevident and yet the direct contrary is an evident fact sciz that we are conscious of many things which are not present to the mind that is which are not like impressions and ideas within the mind nor is there any manner of difficulty to conceive that an impression may be made upon us by an external object in such a manner as to raise a direct perception of the external object itself when we attend to the operations of the external senses the impressions made upon us by external objects are discovered to have very different effects in some instances we feel the impression and are conscious of it as an impression in others being quite unconscious of the impression we perceive only the external object and to give full satisfaction to the reader upon the present subject it may perhaps not be fruitless briefly to run over the operations of the several external senses by which the mind is made conscious of external objects and of their properties  and first with regard to the sense of smelling which gives us no notice of external existences here the operation is of the simplest kind it is no more but an impression made at the organ which is perceived as an impression experience it is true and habit lead us to ascribe this particular impression to some external thing as its cause thus when a particular impression is made upon us termed the sweet smell of a rose we learn to ascribe it to a rose though there is no such object within view because that peculiar impression upon the organ of smelling is always found to accompany the sight and touch of the body called a rose but that this connection is the child of experience only will be evident from the following considerations that when a new smell is perceived we are utterly at a loss what cause to ascribe it to and that when a child feels a smell it is not led to assign it to any cause whatever in this case there can be no other difficulty but to comprehend in what manner the mind becomes conscious of an impression made upon the body upon which it seems sufficient to observe that we are kept entirely ignorant in what manner the soul and body are connected which is no singular case but from our ignorance of the manner of this connection to deny the reality of external existences reducing all to a world of ideas is in reality not less whimsical than if one after admitting the reality of external existences should go about to deny that we have any perception of them merely because we cannot fully account for the manner of this perception nor how a material substance can communicate itself to the mind which is spirit and not matter the same observations may be applied to the sense of hearing with this difference only that a sound is not perceived at least not originally as an impression made at the organ but merely as an existence in the mind  in the senses of tasting and touching we are conscious not only of an impression made at the organ but also of a body which makes the impression when i lay my hand upon this table the impression is of a hard smooth body which resists the motion of my hand in this impression there is nothing to create the least suspicion of fallacy the body acts where it is and it acts merely by resistance there occurs not therefore any other difficulty in this case than that mentioned above sciz after what manner an impression made at an organ of the body is communicated to or perceived by the mind we shall only add upon this head that touch alone which is the least intricate of all our feelings is sufficient to overthrow the doctors whole pompous system we have from that sense the fullest and clearest perception of external existences that can be conceived subject to no doubt ambiguity nor even cavil and this perception must at the same time support the authority of our senses when they give us notice of external existences  what remains to be examined is the sense of seeing which it is presumed the doctor had principally an eye to in arguing against the reality of external existences and indeed the operation of perceiving objects at a distance is so curious and so singular that it is not surprising a rigid philosopher should be puzzled about it in this case there is a difficulty which applies with some show of strength and which possibly has had weight with our author though it is never once mentioned by him it is that no being can act but where it is and that a body at a distance cannot act upon the mind more than the mind upon it i must heartily own that this argument appears to evince the necessity of some intermediate means in the act of vision one means is suggested by matter of fact the image of a visible object is painted upon the retina of the eye and it is not more difficult to conceive that this image may be some how conveyed to the mind than to conceive the manner of its being painted upon the retina this circumstance puts the operation of vision in one respect upon the same footing with that of touching both being performed by means of an impression made at the organ there is indeed this essential difference that the impression of touch is felt as such whereas the impression of sight is not felt we are not conscious of any such impression but merely of the object itself which makes the impression  and here a curious piece of mechanism presents itself to our view though an impression is made upon the mind by means of the image painted upon the retina whereby the external object is perceived yet nature has carefully concealed this impression from us in order to remove all ambiguity and to give us a distinct feeling of the object itself and of that only in touching and tasting the impression made at the organ is so closely connected with the body which makes the impression that the perception of the impression along with that of the body creates no confusion nor ambiguity the body being felt as operating where it really is but were the impression of a visible object felt as made at the retina which is the organ of sight all objects behoved to be seen as within the eye it is doubted among naturalists whether outness or distance is at all discoverable by sight and whether that appearance be not the effect of experience but bodies and their operations are so closely connected in place that were we conscious of an organic impression at the retina the mind would have a constant propensity to place the body there also which would be a circumstance extremely perplexing in the act of vision as setting feeling and experience in perpetual opposition enough to poison all the pleasure we enjoy by that noble sense  for so shortsighted a creature as man it is the worst reason in the world for denying any well attested fact that we cannot account for the manner by which it is brought about it is true we cannot explain after what manner it is that by the intervention of the rays of light the beings and things around us are laid open to our view but it is mere arrogance to pretend to doubt of the fact upon that account for it is in effect maintaining that there is nothing in nature but what we can explain  the perception of objects at a distance by intervention of the rays of light involves no inconsistency nor impossibility and unless this could be asserted we have no reason nor foundation to withold that assent to a matter of fact which is due to the authority of our senses and after all this particular step of the operation of vision is at bottom not more difficult to be conceived or accounted for than the other steps of which no man entertains a doubt it is perhaps not easy to explain how the image of an external body is painted upon the retina tunica and no person pretends to explain how this image is communicated to the mind why then should we hesitate about the last step to wit the perception of external objects more than about the two former when they are all equally supported by the most unexceptionable evidence the whole operation of vision far surpasses human knowledge but not more than the operation of magnetism electricity and a thousand other natural appearances and our ignorance of the cause ought not to make us suspect deceit in the one case more than in the other  we shall conclude this subject with the following reflection whether our perception of the reality of external objects corresponds to the truth of things or whether it be a mere illusion is a question which from the nature of the thing cannot admit of a strict demonstration one thing is certain that supposing the reality of external objects we can form no conception of their being displayed to us in a more lively and convincing manner than in fact is done why then call a thing in doubt of which we have as good evidence as human nature is capable of receiving but we cannot call it in doubt otherways than in speculation and even then but for a moment we have a thorough conviction of the reality of external objects it rises to the highest certainty of belief and we act in consequence of it with the greatest security of not being deceived nor are we in fact deceived when we put the matter to a trial every experiment answers to our perceptions and confirms us more and more in our belief  essay iv of our idea of power the subject proposed to be handled in the present essay is the idea of power and its origin this term is found in all languages we talk familiarly of a power in one body to produce certain effects and of a capacity in another body to have certain effects produced upon it yet authors have differed strangely about the foundation of these ideas and after all that has been said it seems yet to be a matter of uncertainty whether they are suggested by reason by experience or by what other means this subject deserves our attention the more that the bulk of useful knowledge depends upon it without some insight into causes and their effects we should be a very imperfect race of beings and with regard to the present undertaking this subject must not at any rate be overlooked because from it principally is derived any knowledge we have of the deity as will be afterward made evident  power denotes a simple idea which upon that account cannot admit of a definition but no person is nor can be at a loss about the meaning every action we perceive gives us a notion of power for a productive cause is implied in our perception of every action or event essay of liberty and necessity  and the very idea of cause comprehends a power of producing its effect let us only reflect upon the perception we have when we see a stone thrown into the air out of ones hand in the perception of this action are included contiguity of the hand and stone the motion of the persons hand with the stone in it and the separate motion of the stone following the other circumstances in point of time the first circumstance is necessary to put the man in a condition to exert his power upon the stone the second is the actual exertion of the power and the last is the effect produced by that exertion but these circumstances which include both contiguity and succession make no part of the idea of power which is conceived or felt as an inherent property subsisting in the man not merely when he is exerting it but even when he is at rest that all men have this very idea is a fact not to be controverted the only doubt is whence it is derived from what source it springs  that reason cannot help us out will be evident for reason must always have some object to employ itself upon there must be known data or principles to lead us to the discovery of things which are connected with these data or principles but with regard to power which makes a necessary connection betwixt a cause and its effect we have no data nor principles to lead us to the discovery we are not acquainted with the beings and things about us otherways than by certain qualities and properties obvious to the external senses power is none of these nor is there any connection which we can discover betwixt power and any of these in a word we have not the least foundation for concluding power in any body till it once exert its power if it be urged that the effects produced are data from which we can infer a cause by a process of reasoning and consequently a power in the cause to produce these effects i answer that when a new thing or quality is produced when in general any change is brought about it is extremely doubtful whether by any process of reasoning we can conclude it to be an effect so as necessarily to require a cause of its existence that we do conclude it to be an effect is most certain but that we can draw any such conclusion merely from reason i dont clearly see what leads me i confess to this way of thinking is that men of the greatest genius have been unsuccessful in attempting to prove that every thing which begins to exist must have a cause of its existence whatever is produced says mr lock without any cause is produced by nothing or in other words has nothing for its cause but nothing can never be a cause no more than it can be something this is obviously begging the question to affirm that nothing is the cause is taking for granted that a cause is necessary which is the very point undertaken to be made out doctor clarkes argument labors under the same defect every thing he says must have a cause for if any thing wanted a cause it would produce itself that is exist before it existed which is impossible if a thing can exist without a cause there is no necessity it should produce itself or that any thing should produce it in short there does not appear to me any contradiction in the above proposition that a thing may begin to exist without a cause and therefore i dare not declare the fact to be impossible but sense and feeling afford me a conviction that nothing begins to exist without a cause though reason cannot afford me a demonstration of it this matter will be opened afterward at present it is sufficient to observe that the conviction in this case is complete and carries so much authority with it as scarce to admit of a bare conception that the thing can possibly be otherways this subject at the same time affords a new instance of what we have had more than once occasion to observe fond of arguments drawn from the nature of things we are too apt to apply such arguments without discretion and to call that demonstration which at bottom is nothing but a conviction from sense and feeling our perceptions which work silently and without effort are apt to be overlooked and we vainly imagine we can demonstrate every proposition which we perceive to be true  it will be pretty obvious that the idea of power is not deducible from experience more than from reason we can learn nothing merely from experience but that two objects may have been constantly conjoined in time past such as fire and heat the sun and light but in the first place all that can be gathered from such facts comes far short of our idea of cause and effect or of a power in one body to produce some change in another in the second place experience which relates only to the actions of the particular bodies we are acquainted with cannot aid us to discover power in any body that we have not formerly seen in action yet from the very first operation of such a body we have the perception of cause and effect which therefore cannot be from experience and in the last place as experience in no case reaches to futurity our idea of power did it depend upon experience could only look backward with regard to every new production depending upon causes even the most familiar we should be utterly at a loss to form any idea of power  it being now evident that our idea of power is not derived either from reason or experience we shall endeavor to trace out the true foundation of this idea running over the subject the following thoughts occur which i shall set before the reader in their natural order as man in his life and actions is necessarily connected both with the animate and inanimate world he would be utterly at a loss to conduct himself without some acquaintance with the beings around him and their operations his external senses give him all the intelligence that is necessary not only for being but for wellbeing they discover to him in the first place the existence of external things but this would not be sufficient unless they also discovered to him their powers and operations the sense of seeing is the principal means of his intelligence i have explained in a former essay that peculiar manner of perception by which we discover the existence of external objects and when these are put in motion whereby certain things follow it is by another peculiar manner of perception that we discover a relation betwixt certain objects which makes one be termed the cause the other the effect i need scarce repeat again that there is no explaining simple feelings and perceptions otherways than by suggesting the terms which denote them all that can be done in this case is to request of the reader to attend to what passes in his mind when he sees one billiard ball struck against another or a tree which the wind is blowing down or a stone thrown into the air out of ones hand we are obviously so constituted as not only to perceive the one body acting and exerting its power but also to perceive that the change in the other body is produced by means of that action or exertion of power this change we perceive to be an effect and we perceive a necessary connection betwixt the action and the effect so as that the one must unavoidably follow the other  as i discover power in external objects by the eye so i discover power in my mind by an internal sense by one act of the will ideas are raised by another act of the will my limbs are put in motion attending to these operations i perceive or feel the motion of the limbs and the entry of the ideas to follow necessarily from the act of the will in other words i perceive or feel these to be effects and the act of the will to be the cause  and that this feeling is involved in the very perception of the action without taking in either reason or experience may be illustrated by some plain observations there is no relation more familiar even to children than that of cause and effect the first time a child lifts a bit of bread the perception it has of this action not only includes a conjunction of the hand with the bread and that the motion of the latter follows the motion of the former but it likeways includes that peculiar modification which is expressed by a power in the hand to lift the bread accordingly we find no expression more familiar among infants and rusticks nor better understood than i can do this i can do that further as things are best illustrated by their contraries let us put the case of a being if there is such a one who in viewing external objects has no idea of substance but only of qualities and who in viewing motion does not feel the change produced by it to be an effect or any way connected with the motion further than as following it in point of time it appears extremely evident that this supposed being can never have the idea of body or of its powers reason or experience can never give it the idea of body or substance and far less of their powers  it is very true we cannot discover power in any object as we discover the object itself merely by intuition but the moment an alteration is produced by any object we perceive that the object has a power to produce that alteration which leads to denominate the one a cause and the other an effect i dont assert that we can never be in a mistake about this matter children often err by attributing an effect to one cause instead of another or by considering that to be a cause which is not mistakes of this kind are corrected by experience but they prove the reality of the perception of power just as much as where our perceptions are agreeable to the truth of things  and with regard to the fallibility of the sense of seeing when it points out to us causes and effects the comparison may be justly instituted betwixt it and belief the faculty which regulates belief is not infallible it sometimes leads us into errors neither is the faculty infallible by which we discern one thing to be a cause another to be an effect yet both are exerted with sufficient certainty to guide us through life without many capital errors  the author of the treatise of human nature has employed a world of reasoning in searching for the foundation of our idea of power and of necessary connection and after all his anxious researches he can make no more of it but that the idea of necessary connection alias power or energy arises from a number of instances of one thing always following another which connects them in the imagination whereby we can readily foretell the existence of the one from the appearance of the other and he pronounces that this connection can never be suggested from any one of these instances surveyed in all possible lights and positions philosophical essays ess    thus he places the essence of necessary connection or power upon that propensity which custom produces to pass from an object to the idea of its usual attendant and from these premises he draws a conclusion of a very extraordinary nature and which he himself acknowledges to be not a little paradoxical his words are upon the whole necessity is something that exists in the mind not in objects nor is it possible for us even to form the most distant idea of it considered as a quality in bodies the efficacy or energy in causes is neither placed in the causes themselves nor in the deity nor in the concurrence of these two principles but belongs entirely to the soul which considers the union of two or more objects in all past instances it is here that the real power of causes is placed along with their connection and necessity treatise of human nature vol   page   0       he may well admit this doctrine to be a violent paradox because in reality it contradicts our natural feelings and wages war with the common sense of mankind we cannot put this in a stronger light than our author himself does in forming an objection against his own doctrine what the efficacy of causesly in the determination of the mind as if causes did not operate entirely independent of the mind and would not continue their operation even though there was no mind existent to contemplate them or reason concerning them this is to reverse the order of nature and to make that secondary which is really primary to every operation there is a power proportioned and this power must be placed on the body that operates if we remove the power from one cause we must ascribe it to another but to remove it from all causes and bestow it on a being that is noways related to the cause or effect but by perceiving them is a gross absurdity and contrary to the most certain principles of human reason page      in short nothing is more clear than that from the very sight of bodies in motion we have the idea of power which connects them together in the relation of cause and effect this power is perceived as a quality in the acting body and by no means is an operation of the mind or an easy transition of thought from one object to another and therefore flatly to deny our perception of such a quality in bodies as our author does is taking upon him to contradict a plain matter of fact of which all the word can give testimony he may be at a loss indeed to discover the source of this perception because he can neither derive it nor the idea of substance from his own principles but it has been more than once observed that it is too bold to deny a fact supported by the best evidence merely because one is at a loss to discover the cause at the same time there is no manner of difficulty to lay open the foundation of these perceptions both of them are impressions of sight as is clearly made out above  and to show that our authors account of this matter comes far short of truth it will be plain from one or two instances that though a constant connection of two objects may by habit or custom produce a similar connection in the imagination yet that a constant connection whether in the imagination or betwixt the objects themselves does by no means come up to our idea of power far from it in a garrison the soldiers constantly turn out at a certain beat of the drum the gates of the town are opened and shut regularly as the clock points at a certain hour these facts are observed by a child grow up with him and turn habitual during a long life in this instance there is a constant connection betwixt objects which is attended with a similar connection in the imagination yet the person above supposed if not a changeling never imagined the beat of the drum to be the cause of the motion of the soldiers nor the pointing of the clock to a certain hour to be the cause of the opening or shutting of the gates he perceives the cause of these operations to be very different and is not led into any mistake by the above circumstances however closely connected let us put another instance still more apposite such is the human constitution that we act necessarily upon the existence of certain perceptions or motives the prospect of victuals makes a hungry man accelerate his pace respect to an ancient family moves him to take a wife an object of distress prompts him to lay out his money or venture his person yet no man dreams a motive to be the cause of action though if the doctrine of necessity hold true here is not only a constant but a necessary connection a thought or idea it is obvious cannot be the cause of action cannot of itself produce motion after what manner then does it operate i explain the matter thus the power of magnetism or any other particular power in matter by which the body endued with the power is impelled toward other bodies cannot operate if there is no other body placed within its sphere of activity but placing another body there the magnetic body is directly impelled toward this new body yet the new body is not the cause of the motion but only the occasion of it the condition of the power being such that the body endued with it cannot operate but with relation to another body within its sphere of action precisely in the same manner does the mind act upon presenting of a thought or idea the idea is not the cause of the action but only the occasion of it it is the mind which exerts the action only it is so framed that it cannot exert its powers otherways than upon the presenting of certain perceptions to it   from the instance last given it appears that constant connection and the other circumstances mentioned by our author are far from coming up to our idea of power there may be even a necessary connection betwixt two objects without putting them in the relation of cause and effect and without involving a power in the one to produce the other our author then attempts rather too bold an enterprise when he undertakes to argue mankind out of their senses and feelings that we have such a feeling of power as is above described is a fact that cannot admit of the smallest controversy and all that is left him would he argue with any prospect of success is to question whether this feeling does in fact correspond to the truth of things but he will not undertake so stubborn a task as to prove this a delusive feeling when he must be sensible of the wonderful harmony that subsists betwixt it and the reality of causes and their effects we have no reason to suspect deceit in this case more than with regard to many other senses some of which remain to be unfolded that are wrought into the constitution of man for wise and good purposes and without which he would be a very irregular and defective being  and were it necessary to say more upon a subject which indeed merits the utmost attention we have if i mistake not this authors own evidence for us which i consider as no mean evidence in any case and which must be held of the greatest authority when given against himself and this evidence he gives in his philosophical essays for though in this work he continues to maintain that necessity exists only in the mind not in objects and that it is not possible for us even to form the most distant idea of it considered as a quality in bodies yet in the course of the argument he more than once discovers that he himself is possessed of an idea of power considered as a quality in bodies though he has not attended to it thus he observes london edition page     that nature conceals from us those powers and principles on which the influence of objects entirely depends and of these powers and principles he gives several apt instances such as a power or quality in bread to nourish a power by which bodies persevere in motion this is not only owning an idea of power as a quality in bodies but also owning the reality of this power in another passage page     he observes that the particular powers by which all natural operations are performed never appear to the senses and that experience does not lead us to the knowledge of the secret power by which one object produces another what leads us to the knowledge of this secret power is not at present the question but here is the authors own acknowledgment that he has an idea of a power in one object to produce another for he certainly will not say that he is here making use of words without having any ideas annexed to them in one passage in particular page      he talks distinctly and explicitly of a power in one object by which it infallibly produces the other and operates with the greatest certainty and strongest necessity no master of language can give a description of power considered as a quality in bodies in more apt or more expressive terms so difficult it is to stifle or to disguise natural feelings and sentiments naturam expellas furca tamen usque recurret   if the foregoing arguments have not prevailed may not the following argument hope for success figure the simplest of all cases a man rising from his seat to walk through the room and try to analyze the perception of this simple event in the first place is the man active or passive is he moved or does he move himself no mortal is at a loss to understand these questions and no mortal is at a loss to answer them we have a distinct perception or feeling that the man is not moved but moves or which is the same moves himself let us examine in the next place what is involved in the perception or feeling we have when we see this man walking do we not say familiarly does not a child say that he can walk and what other thing do we mean by this expression than that he has a power to walk does not the very idea of walking include in it a power to walk in this instance our author unhappily for his argument has neither contiguity nor succession to recur to for explaining his idea of power imperfect as it is and therefore with regard to this instance he must either admit that we have an idea of power considered as a quality in objects or take upon him to deny that we have any idea of power at all for it is evident that the idea of power when it comprehends only a single object can never be resolved into a connection in the imagination betwixt two or more objects we have thus the feeling of power from every action be it of the simplest kind that can be figured and having once acquired the idea of power exerted by an animal to put itself in motion we readily transfer that idea to the actions of bodies animate and inanimate upon each other and after all with due regard to an author of very acute parts i cannot help observing that there is perhaps not one idea of all the train which is more familiar to us or more universal than the idea of power  having thus ascertained the reality of our idea of power as a quality in bodies and traced it to its proper source i shall close this essay with some observations upon causes and their effects that we cannot discover power in any object otherways than by seeing it exert its power is above observed therefore we can never discover any object to be a cause otherways than by the effect produced but with regard to things caused or produced the case is very different for we can discover an object to be an effect after the cause is removed or when it is not at all seen for instance no one is at a loss to say that a table or a chair is an effect produced a child will ask who made it we perceive every event every new object to be an effect or production the very conception of which involves the idea of a cause hence the maxim that nothing can fall out nothing begin to exist without a cause in other words that every thing which begins to exist must have a cause a maxim universally recognized and admitted by all mankind as selfevident nor can this be attributed to experience the feeling is original regarding singular objects and events the causes of which are utterly unknown not less than objects and events which depend upon familiar causes children and rusticks are conscious of this feeling equally with those who have the most consummate experience of nature and its operations see the essay upon liberty and necessity page      further the perception we have of any object as an effect includes in it the feeling of a cause proportioned to the effect if the object be an effect properly adapted to some end the perception of it necessarily includes an intelligent designing cause if the effect be some good end brought about by proper means the perception necessarily includes a designing and benevolent cause nor is it in our power by any sort of constraint to vary these feelings or to give them a different modification from what they have by nature it may be in our power to conceive but it is not in our power to believe that a fine piece of painting a well wrote poem or a beautiful piece of architecture can ever be the effect of chance or of blind fatality the supposition indeed so far as we can discover does not involve any inconsistency in the nature of things it may be possible for any reason we have to the contrary that a blind and undesigning cause may be productive of excellent effects but our senses discover what reason does not that every object which appears beautiful as adapted to an end or purpose is the effect of a designing cause and that every object which appears beautiful as fitted to a good end or purpose is the effect of a designing cause and that every object which appears beautiful as fitted to a good end or purpose is the effect of a designing and benevolent cause we are so constituted that we can entertain no doubt of this if we would and so far as we gather from experience we are not deceived  essay v of our knowledge of future events while we are tied to this globe some knowledge of the beings around us and of their operations is necessary because without it we should be utterly at a loss how to conduct ourselves this subject is handled in two former essays but were our knowledge limited to this subject it would not be sufficient for our wellbeing and scarce for our preservation it is likeways necessary that we have some knowledge of future events for about these we are mostly employed a man will not sow if he has not a prospect of reaping he will not build a house if he has not some security that it will stand firm for years man is possessed of this valuable branch of knowledge he can foretell future events there is no doubt of the fact the difficulty only is what are the means employed in making the discovery it is indeed an established maxim that the course of nature continues uniformly the same and that things will be as they have been but from what premises we draw this conclusion is not obvious uniformity in the operations of nature with regard to time past is discovered by experience but of future time having no experience the maxim assuredly cannot be derived from that source neither will reason help us out it is true the production of one thing by another even in a single instance implies a power and this power is necessarily connected with its effect but as power is an internal property not discoverable but by the effects produced we can never by any chain of reasoning conclude power to be in any body except in the instant of operation the power for ought we know may be at an end from that very instant we cannot so much as conclude from any deduction of reason that this earth the sun or any one being will exist tomorrow and supposing their future existence to be discoverable by reason we are not so much acquainted with the nature or essence of any one thing as to discover a necessary connection betwixt it and its powers that the one subsisting the other must also subsist there is nothing so easy to conceive as that the most active being shall at at once be deprived of all its activity and a thing that may be conceived can never be proved inconsistent or impossible an appeal to past experience will not carry us through the sun has afforded us light and heat from the beginning of the world but what reason have we to conclude that its power of giving light and heat must continue when it is as easy to conceive powers to be limited in point of time as to conceive them perpetual if to help us our here we have recourse to the wisdom and goodness of a supreme being as establishing permanent general laws the difficulty is that we have no data from whence to conclude in the way of reasoning that these general laws must continue invariably the same without end it is true the conclusion is actually made but it must be referred to some other source for reasoning will not aid us more than experience does to draw any one conclusion from past to future events it is certain at the same time that the uniformity of natures operations is a maxim admitted by all mankind though altogether unassisted either by reason or experience we never have the least hesitation to conclude that things will be as they have been in so much that we trust our lives and fortunes upon this conclusion i shall endeavor to trace out the principle upon which this important conclusion is founded and this subject will afford it is hoped a fresh instance of the admirable correspondence which is discovered betwixt the nature of man and his external circumstances what is already made out will lead us directly to our point if our conviction of the uniformity of nature is not founded upon reason nor experience it can have no other foundation but sense and feeling the fact truly is that we are so constituted as by a necessary determination of nature to transfer our past experience to futurity and to have a direct perception or feeling of the constancy and uniformity of nature this perception or feeling must belong to an internal sense because it evidently has no relation to any of our external senses and an argument which has been more than once stated in the foregoing essays will be found decisive upon this point let us suppose a being which has no perception or notion of the uniformity of nature such a being will never be able to transfer its past experience to futurity every event however conformable to past experience will come equally unexpected to this being as new and rare events do to us though possibly without the same surprise  this sense of constancy and uniformity in the works of nature is not confined to the subject above handled but displays itself remarkably upon many other objects we have a conviction of a common nature in beings which are similar in their appearances we expect a likeness in their constituent parts in their appetites and in their conduct we not only lay our account with uniformity of behavior in the same individual but in all the individuals of the same species this principle has such influence as even to make us hope for constancy and uniformity where experience would lead us to the opposite conclusion the rich man never thinks of poverty nor the distressed of relief even in this variable climate we cannot readily bring ourselves to believe that good or bad weather will have an end nay it governs our notions in lawmatters and is the foundation of the maxim that alteration or change of circumstances is not to be presumed influenced by the same principle every man acquires a certain uniformity of manner which spreads itself upon his thoughts words and actions in our younger years the effect of this principle is less remarkable being opposed by a variety of passions which as they have different and sometimes opposite tendencies occasion a fluctuation in our conduct but so soon as the heat of youth is over this principle acting without counterbalance seldom fails to bring on a punctual regularity in our way of living which is extremely remarkable in most old people  analogy is one of the most common sources of reasoning the force of which is universally admitted the conviction of every argument founded on analogy arises from this very sense of uniformity things similar in some particulars are presumed to be similar in every particular  in a word as the bulk of our views and actions have a future aim some knowledge of future events is necessary that we may adapt our views and actions to natural events to this end the author of our nature has done two things he has established a constancy and uniformity in the operations of nature and he has impressed upon our minds a conviction or belief of this constancy and uniformity and that things will be as they have been  essay vi of our dread of supernatural powers in the dark a very slight view of human nature is sufficient to convince us that we were not dropped here by accident this earth is fitted for man and man is fitted for inhabiting this earth by means of instinctive faculties we have an intuitive knowledge of the things that surround us at least of such things by which we may be affected we can discover objects at a distance we discern them in their connection of cause and effect and their future operations are laid open as well as their present but in this grand apparatus of instinctive faculties by which the secrets of nature are disclosed to us one faculty seems to be withheld though in appearance the most useful of all and that is a faculty to discern what things are noxious and what are friendly the most poisonous fruits have sometimes the fairest colors and the savage animals partake of beauty with the tame and harmless and when other particulars are inquired into it will be found by induction that man has no original feeling of what is salutary to him and what is hurtful  it is natural to inquire why this instinct is withheld when it appears to be the design of nature to furnish us plentifully with instincts for the discovery of useful truths with regard to this matter it is too bold an undertaking for man to dive into all the secrets of his maker we ought to rest contented with the numerous instances we have of good order and good purpose which must afford us a rational conviction that good order and good purpose take place universally at the same time a rational account may be suggested of this matter we have a conviction that there is nothing redundant or superfluous in the operations of nature different means are never afforded us to bring about the same end experience so far as it can go is given us for acquiring knowledge and instinct only where experience cannot aid us it is true instinct is a more compendious way of discovering useful truths but man was intended an active being and therefore left to his own industry as much as possible  man then is placed in this world amidst a great variety of objects the nature and tendency of which are unknown to him otherways than by experience in this situation he would be in perpetual danger had he not some faithful monitor to keep him constantly upon the watch against harm this monitor is the propensity he has to be afraid of new objects such especially which have no peculiar beauty to raise his desire a child to whom all nature is strange dreads the approach of every object and even the face of man is frightful to it the same timidity and suspicion may be observed in travelers who converse with strangers and meet with unknown appearances upon the first sight of an herb or fruit we apprehend the worst and suspect it to be noxious an unknown animal is immediately conceived to be dangerous the more rare phenomenon of nature the causes of which are unknown to the vulgar never fail to strike them with terror from this induction it is clear that we dread unknown objects they are always surveyed with an emotion of fear till experience discovers them to be harmless  this dread of unknown objects is supposed to enter into the constitution of all sensitive beings but is most remarkable in the weak and defenseless the more feeble and delicate the creature is the more shy and timorous it is observed to be no creature is by nature more feeble and delicate than man and this principle is to him of admirable use to keep him constantly upon his guard and to balance the principle of curiosity which is prevalent in man above all other creatures and which left to itself would often betray him into fatal accidents  the dread of unknown objects is apt to fire the imagination so as to magnify their supposed evil qualities and tendencies for it is a well known truth that passion has a wonderful effect upon the imagination the less we know of a new object the greater liberty we take to dress it up in frightful colors the object is forthwith conceived to have all those dreadful qualities which are suggested by the imagination and the same terror is raised as if those qualities were real and not imaginary see essay upon belief   again where the new and unknown objects have any thing dreadful in appearance this circumstance joined with our natural propensity to dread unknown objects will raise terror even in the most resolute if the evils dreaded from such objects are known neither in quality nor degree the imagination being under no restraint figures the greatest evils both in kind and magnitude that can be conceived where no immediate harm ensues the mind by the impulse it has received transports itself into futurity and imagines the strange forms to be presages of direful calamities hence it is that the uncommon phenomenon of nature such as comets eclipses earthquakes and the like are by the vulgar held as forerunners of uncommon events grand objects make a deep impression upon the mind and give force to that passion which occupies it at the time the above appearances being uncommon if not altogether new dispose the mind to terror which aided by the emotion arising from the grandeur of the objects produces great agitation and a violent apprehension of danger  the strongest and most familiar instance of our natural propensity to dread unknown objects is the fear that seizes many young persons in the dark which is a phenomenon that has not been accounted for with any degree of satisfaction light disposes the mind to cheerfulness and courage darkness on the contrary depresses the mind and disposes it to fear any object alarms the mind when it is already prepared by darkness to receive impressions of fear the object which in the dark is seen but obscurely leaves the heated imagination at full liberty to bestow upon it the most dreadful appearance this phantom of the imagination conceived as a reality unhinges the mind and throws it into a fit of distraction the imagination now heated to the highest degree multiplies the dreadful appearances to the utmost bounds of its conception the object becomes a spectre a devil a hobgoblin something more terrible than ever was seen or described  a very few accidents of this kind having so powerful an effect are sufficient to introduce an association between darkness and malignant powers and when once this association is formed there is no occasion for the appearance of an object to create terror frightful ideas crowd into the mind and augment the fear which is occasioned by darkness the imagination becomes ungovernable and converts these ideas into real appearances  that the terror occasioned by darkness is entirely owing to the operations of the imagination will be evident from a single reflection that in company no such effect is produced a companion can afford no security against supernatural powers but a companion has the same effect with sunshine to cheer the mind and preserve it from gloominess and despondency the imagination is thereby kept within bounds and under due subjection to sense and reason  essay vii of our knowledge of the deity the arguments a priori for the existence and attributes of the deity are urged with the greatest show of reason in the sermons preached at boyles lectures but the sermons upon this subject though they command my strictest attention never have gained my heart on the contrary they always give me a sensible uneasiness the cause of which i have been at a loss to discover though now i imagine i can explain it such deep metaphysical reasoning if it afford any conviction is surely not adapted to the vulgar and illiterate is the knowledge of god then reserved for persons of great study and deep thinking is a vail thrown over the eyes of the rest of mankind this thought always returned upon me and gave me pain if there really exists a being who made and who governs the world and if it be his purpose to display himself to his rational creatures it is not consistent with any idea we can form of the power and wisdom of this being that his purpose should be defeated which plainly is the case in a great measure if he is only to be discovered and but obscurely by a very small part of mankind at the same time to found our knowledge of the deity solely upon reasoning is not agreeable to the analogy of nature we are not left to gather our duty by abstract reasoning nor indeed by any reasoning it is engraved upon the table of our hearts we adapt our actions to the course of nature by mere instinct without reasoning or even experience therefore if we can trust to analogy we ought to expect that god will discover himself to us in some such manner as may take in all mankind the vulgar and illiterate as well as the deep thinking philosopher  if these abstruse arguments however are relished by the learned and speculative it is so far well i cannot help acknowledging that they afford me no conviction at least no solid and permanent conviction we know little about the nature of things but what we learn from a strict attention to our own nature that nothing can begin to exist without a cause is sufficiently evident from sense and feeling see the essay of our idea of power toward the close  but that this can be demonstrated by any argument a priori drawn from the nature of things i have not observed see the same essay at the beginning  and if demonstration fail us in the very outsetting we cannot hope for its assistance in the after steps if any one being can begin to exist without a cause every being may upon which supposition we never can hope for a demonstration that any one being must be eternal but if this difficulty shall be surmounted we have another to struggle with admitting that something has existed from all eternity i find no data to determine a priori whether this world has existed of itself from all eternity in a constant succession of causes and effects or whether it be an effect produced by an almighty power it is indeed hard to conceive a world eternal and selfexistent where all things are carried on by blind fate without design or intelligence and yet i can find no demonstration to the contrary if we can form any obscure notion of one intelligent being existing from all eternity it appears not more difficult to form a notion of a succession of beings with or without intelligence or a notion of a perpetual succession of causes and effects  in short difficulties press both ways but these difficulties when examined do not arise from any inconsistency in our ideas they are occasioned merely by the limited capacity of the mind of man we cannot comprehend an eternity of existence it is too bulky an object it eludes our grasp the mind is like the eye it cannot take in an object that is very great or very little this plainly is the source of our difficulties when we attempt speculations so remote from common apprehension abstract reasoning upon such a subject must lead into endless perplexities it is indeed less difficult to conceive one eternal unchangeable being who made the world than to conceive a blind chain of causes and effects at least we are disposed to the former as being more agreeable to the imagination but as we cannot find any inconsistency in the latter supposition we cannot justly say that it is demonstrably false  give me leave to add that to bring out such abstruse and intricate speculations into any clear and persuasive light is at any rate scarce to be expected and if after the utmost straining they remain obscure and unaffecting it is evident to me that they must have a bad tendency persons of a peevish and gloomy cast of mind finding no conviction from that quarter will be fortisied in their propensity to believe that all things happen by blind chance that there is no wisdom order or harmony in the government of this world and consequently that there is no god  being therefore little sollicitous about arguments a priori for the existence of a deity which are not proportioned to the capacity of man i apply myself with zeal and cheerfulness to search for the deity in his works for by these we must discover him if he has thought proper to make himself known and the better to manage the inquiry i shall endeavor to make out three propositions  st that if there is a being who is the maker and governor of the world it is agreeable to any notions we can form of his government that he should make some discovery of himself to his intelligent creatures  dly that in fact he has done so and  dly that he has done so in a manner agreeable to the nature of man and analogous to his other operations  there certainly cannot be a more discouraging thought to man than that the world was formed by a fortuitous concourse of atoms and that all things are carried on by blind impulse upon that supposition he can have no security for his life nor for his continuing to be a moral agent and an intelligent creature even for a moment things have been carried on with regularity and order but chance may in an instant throw all things into the most horrid and dismal confusion we can have no solid comfort in virtue when it is a work of mere chance nor can we justify our reliance upon the faith of others when the nature of man rests upon so precarious a foundation every thing must appear gloomy dismal and disjointed without a deity to unite this world of beings into one beautiful and harmonious system these considerations and many more that will occur upon the first reflection afford a very strong conviction if there is a wise and good being who superintends the affairs of this world that he will not conceal himself from his rational creatures can any thing be more desirable or more substantially useful than to know that there is a being from whom no secrets are hid to whom our good works are acceptable and even the good purposes of our hearts and whose government directed by wisdom and benevolence ought to make us rest secure that nothing does or will fall out but according to good order this sentiment rooted in the mind is an antidote to all misfortune without it life is at best but a confused and gloomy scene  and this leads to a different consideration which makes our knowledge of a benevolent deity of the greatest importance to us though natural and moral evil are far from prevailing in this world yet so much of both is scattered over the face of things as to create some degree of doubt whether there may not be a mixture of chance or of ill will in the government of this world but once supposing the superintendency of a good being these evils are no longer considered as such a man restrains himself from unlawful pleasures though the restraint gives him pain but then he does not consider this pain as an evil to repine at he submits to it voluntarily and with satisfaction as one does to grief for the loss of a friend being conscious that it is right and fit for him to be so affected in the same manner he submits to all the evils of this life having confidence in the good government of the deity he is persuaded that every thing happens for the best and therefore that it is his duty to submit to whatever happens this unfolds a scene so enlivening and so productive of cheerfulness and good humor that we cannot readily think if there is a benevolent deity that he will withold from his creatures so invaluable a blessing  man at the same time by his taste for beauty regularity and order is fitted for contemplating the wisdom and goodness displayed in the frame and government of this world these are proper objects of admiration and joy it is not agreeable to the ordinary course of nature that man should be endowed with an affection without having a proper object to bestow it upon and as the providence of the deity is the highest object of this affection it would be unnatural that he should be kept in ignorance of it  these i admit are but probable reasons for believing that if there is a benevolent deity it must be his intention to manifest himself to his creatures but they carry a very high degree of probability which leaves little room for doubt at the same time though it should be our fate to search in vain for this object of our affection we ought not however to despair and in that despair to conclude there is no god let us but reflect that he has not manifested himself to all his creatures the brutes apparently know nothing of him and should we be disappointed in this search the worst we can conclude is that for good and wise purposes which we cannot dive into he has thought proper to withold himself also from us we certainly have no reason to convert our ignorance into an argument against his existence our ignorance brings us only a step lower and puts us so far upon a footing with the brute creation  the second and important branch of our disquisition is to ascertain this fact that there is a deity and that he has manifested himself to us i request only attention of my reader and not any unreasonable concession in a former essay of our idea of power  two propositions are made out the first is that every thing which has a beginning is perceived as a production or effect which necessarily involves the idea of a cause the second that we necessarily transfer to the cause whatever of contrivance or design is discovered in the effect considering a house garden picture or statue in itself it is perceived as beautiful if we attend to these objects in a different view as things having a beginning we perceive them to be effects involving the idea of a cause if again we consider them as artfully contrived to answer certain purposes we perceive them to be the workmanship of some person of skill nor are we deceived in these perceptions upon examination we find that they correspond to truth and reality  but not only are these objects perceived as effects which we afterward learn from experience to be the production of man natural objects such as plants and animals as well as all other objects which once were not are also perceived as effects or as the production of some cause the question will always recur how came it here who made it what is the cause of its existence  we are so accustomed to human arts that every work of design and use will be attributed to man but what if it exceed his known powers and faculties this supposition does not alter the nature of our feelings but only leads us to a different cause and in place of man to determine upon some superior power if the object be considered as an effect it necessarily involves the idea of a cause and the cause cannot be man if the object of our perception be an effect far surpassing the power of man this train of thinking leads us directly to our point attend but to the anatomy of the meanest plant so much of art and of curious mechanism is discovered in it that it must be the production of some cause far surpassing the power and intelligence of man the scene opens more and more when passing from plants to animals we come to man the most wonderful of all the works of nature and when at last we take in at one view the natural and moral world full of harmony order and beauty happily adjusted in all its parts to answer great and glorious purposes there is in this grand production necessarily involved the perception of a cause unbounded in power intelligence and goodness  thus it is that the deity has manifested himself to us by the means of principles wrought into our nature which must infallibly operate upon viewing objects in their relation of cause and effect we discover external objects by their qualities of color figure size and motion in the perception of these qualities connected after a certain manner is comprehended the feeling of the substance or thing to which these qualities belong at the same time we perceive this substance or thing supposing it to have a beginning of existence to be an effect produced by some cause and we perceive the powers and properties of this cause from its effects if there is an aptitude in the effect to some end we attribute to the cause intelligence and design if the effect produced be some thing that is good in itself or that has a tendency to some good end or pupose we attribute goodness to the cause as well as intelligence and design and this we do not by any process of reasoning but merely by perception and feeling the deity has not left his existence to be gathered from slippery and farfetched arguments we have but to open our eyes to receive impressions of him almost from every thing we perceive we discover his being and attributes in the same manner that we discover external objects we have but to appeal to our own perceptions and none but those who are so stubbornly hypothetical as to deny the existence of matter against the evidence of their senses can seriously and deliberately deny the existence of the deity in fine there is a wonderful harmony established betwixt our perceptions and the course of nature we trust to our perceptions for the existence of external objects and their past present and future operations we trust to these perceptions by the necessity of our nature and upon experience find ourselves not deceived our perception of the deity is as distinct and authoritative as that of external objects and though here we cannot have experience to appeal to the want of experience can never afford an argument against the authority of any perception where from the nature of the thing there can be no experience it is sufficient for conviction that our perceptions in general correspond to the truth of things wherever there is an opportunity to try them by experience and therefore we can have no cause to doubt of our perceptions in any case where they are not contradicted by experience  so far the deity is discoverable by every person who goes but one step beyond the surface of things and their mere existence we may indeed behold the earth in its gayest dress the heavens in all their glory without having any perception other than that of beauty something in these objects that pleases and delights us many pass their lives brutishly involved in the gross pleasures of sense without having any feeling at least any strong or permanent feeling of the deity and possibly this in general is the case of savages before they are humanized by society and government but the deity cannot be long a secret from those who are accustomed to any degree of reflection no sooner are we enabled to relish beauties of the second and third class see the essay upon the foundation and principles of the law of nature  no sooner do we acquire a taste for regularity order design and good purpose than we begin to perceive the deity in the beauty of the operations of nature savages who have no consistent rule of conduct who act by the blind impulse of passion and appetite and who have only a glimmering of the moral sense are but ill qualified to discover the deity in his works if they have little or no perception of a just tenor of life of the dignity of behavior and of the beauty of action how should they perceive the beauty of the works of creation and the admirable harmony of all the parts in the great system of things being conscious of nothing but disorder and sensual impulse within they cannot be conscious of any thing better without them society teaches mankind selfdenial and improves the moral sense disciplined in society the taste for order and regularity unfolds itself by degrees the social affections gain the ascendant and the morality of actions gets firm possession of the mind in this improved state the beauty of the creation makes a strong impression and we can never cease admiring the excellency of that cause who is the author of so many beautiful effects and thus to society we owe all the blessings of life and particularly the knowledge of the deity that most inestimable branch of human knowledge  hitherto we have gone no further than to point out the means by which we discover the deity and his attributes of power wisdom and goodness so far are we carried by those wonderful principles in our nature which discover the connection betwixt cause and effect and from the effect discover the powers and properties of the cause but there is one attribute of the supreme being of the most essential kind which remains to be unfolded it is what commonly passes under the name of selfexistence that he must have existed for ever and consequently that he cannot be considered as an effect to require a cause of his existence but on the contrary without being caused that mediately or immediately he is the cause of all other things a principle we have had occasion more than once to mention will make this evident sciz that nothing can begin to exist without a cause every thing which comes into existence and once was not is by a necessary determination of our nature perceived as an effect or as a production the very conception of which involves an adequate cause now if every thing has a beginning one being at least to wit that which first came into existence must be an effect or production without a cause which is a direct inconsistency if all beings had a beginning there was a time when the world was an absolute void upon which supposition it is intuitively certain that nothing could ever have come into existence this proposition we feel to be true and our feeling affords us in this case a more solid conviction than any demonstration can do one being therefore must have existed from all eternity who as he is not an effect or production cannot possibly be indebted for his existence to any other being at the same time as we can have no foundation for supposing the existence of more eternal beings than one this one being must be the deity because all other beings mediately or immediately owe their existence to him all other beings as they are supposed to be produced in time must have a cause of their existence and by the supposition there can be no other cause but this eternal being the bulk of mankind probably in their notions of the deity scarce comprehend this attribute of selfexistence a man must be used a good deal to abstract reasoning who of himself discovers this truth but it is not difficult to explain it to others after it is discovered and it deserves well to be inculcated for without it our knowledge of the deity must be extremely imperfect his other attributes of power wisdom and goodness are in some measure communicated to his creatures but his attribute of selfexistence makes the strongest opposition imaginable betwixt him and his creatures  a few words will suffice upon the third proposition which in a good measure is already explained the essence of the deity is far beyond the reach of our comprehension were he to exhibit himself to us in broad daylight it is not a thing supposable that he could be reached by any of our external senses the attributes of selfexistence wisdom goodness and power are purely intellectual and therefore so far as we can comprehend there are no ordinary means to acquire any knowledge of the deity but by his works and indeed by means of that sense which discovers causes from their effects he has manifested himself to us in a fatisfactory manner liable to no doubt nor error and after all what further evidence can we desire when the evidence we have of his existence is little inferior to that we have of our own existence impressions or perceptions serve us for evidence in both cases see the essay upon the idea of self and personal identity  our own existence indeed is of all facts that which concerns us most and therefore of our own existence we ought to have the highest certainty next to it we have not as it appears to me a greater certainty of any matter of fact than of the existence of the deity it is at least equal to the certainty we have of external objects and of the constancy and uniformity of the operations of nature upon the faith of which our whole schemes of life are adjusted  the arguments a posteriori which have been urged for the being and attributes of the deity are generally defective there is always wanting one link of the chain to wit that peculiar principle upon which is founded our knowledge of causes and their effects but the calm perceptions turning habitual by frequent repetition are apt to be overlooked in our reasonings many a proposition is rendered obscure by much labored argument for the truth of which we need but appeal to our own perceptions thus we are told that the frame and order of the world the wisdom and goodness displayed in every part of it are an evident demonstration of the being of a god i confess these things afford us full conviction of his being but laying aside perception and feeling i should be utterly at a loss by any sort of reasoning to conclude the existence of any one thing from that of any other thing in particular by what process of reasoning can we demonstrate this conclusion to be true that order and beauty must needs proceed from a designing cause it is true the idea of an effect involves the idea of a cause but how does reason make out that the thing we name an effect may not exist of itself as well as what we name a cause if it be urged that human works where means are apparently adjusted to an end and beautty and order discovered are always known to be the effects of intelligence and design true they are and as far as i have experience i believe the fact to be so but where experience fails me i desire to know by what step what link in the chain of reasoning am i to connect my past experience with this inference that in every case i ought to form the same conclusion if it be said that nature prompts us to judge of similar instances by former experience this is giving up reason and demonstration to appeal to that very feeling on which i contend the evidence of this truth must entirely rest all the arguments a posteriori may be resolved into this principle which no doubt has had its due influence upon the writers who handle the present subject though i must be allowed to say it has not been explained nor perhaps sufficiently understood by them whereby all of them have been led into the error of stating as demonstrative reasoning what is only an appeal to our senses they reason for example upon the equality of males and females and hold the infinite odds against this equality to be a demonstration that matters cannot be carried on by chance this considered as mere reasoning does not conclude for besides that chance is infinite in its varieties there may be some blind fatality some unknown cause in the nature of things which produces this uniformity but though reason cannot afford demonstration in this case sense and feeling afford conviction the equality of males and females is one of the many instances which we know and feel to be the effects of a designing cause and of which we can no more entertain a doubt than of our own existence the same principle which unfolds to us the connection of causes and their effects in the most common events discovers this whole universe to stand in the relation of an effect to a supreme cause  to substitute feeling in place of reason and demonstration may seem to put the evidence of the deity upon too low a footing but human reason is not so mighty an affair as philosophers vainly pretend it affords very little aid in making original discoveries the comparing of things together and directing our inferences from feeling and experience are its proper province in this way reason gives its aid to lead us to the knowledge of the deity it enlarges our views of final causes and of the prevalence of wisdom and goodness but the application of the argument from final causes to prove the existence of a deity and the force of our conclusion from beautiful and orderly effects to a designing cause are not from reason but from an internal light which shows things in their relation of cause and effect these conclusions rest entirely upon sense and feeling and it is surprising that writers should overlook what is so natural and so obvious but the pride of mans heart makes him desire to extend his discoveries by dint of reasoning for reasoning is our own work there is merit in acuteness and penetration and we are better pleased to assume merit to ourselves than humbly to acknowledge that to the most important discoveries we are directly led by the hand of the almighty  having unfolded that principle upon which i would rest the most important of all truths objections must not be overlooked such as appear to have weight and i shall endeavor to give these objections their strongest effect which ought to be done in every dispute and which becomes more strictly a duty in handling a subject where truth is of the utmost importance  considering the above argument on all sides i do not find that it can be more advantageously combated than by opposing to it the eternity and selfexistence of the world governed by chance or blind fatality it is above admitted to be very difficult by any abstract reasoning to prove the inconsistency of this supposition but we feel the inconsistency for the frame and conduct of this world contain in them too much of wisdom art and foresight to admit of the supposition of chance or blind fatality we are necessarily determined by a principle in our nature to attribute such effects to some intelligent and designing cause supposing this cause to be the world itself we have at least got free of the supposition of chance and blind satality and if the world be a being endued with unbounded power intelligence and benevolence the world is the being we are in quest of for we have no other idea of the deity but of an eternal and selfexistent being endued with power wisdom and goodness but the hypothesis thus reformed still contradicts our perceptions the world is made up of parts separable and actually separated the attributes of unbounded power intelligence and benevolence do certainly not belong to this earth and as little to the sun moon or stars which are not conceived to be even voluntary agents therefore these attributes must belong to a being who made the earth sun moon and stars and who connects the whole together in one system  a second objection may be that the above reasoning by which we conclude the eternity and selfexistence of one being who made this world does not necessarily infer such a conclusion but only an eternal succession of such beings which may be reckoned a more natural supposition and more agreeable to our feelings than the idea of one eternal selfexistent being without any cause of his existence  in matters so profound it is difficult to form ideas with any degree of accuracy i have observed above that it is too much for man to grasp in his idea an eternal being whose existence upon that account cannot admit of the supposition of a cause to talk as some of our metaphysical writers do of an absolute necessity in the nature of the being as the cause of his existence is mere jargon for we can conceive nothing more clearly than that the cause must go before the effect and that the cause cannot possibly be in the effect but however difficult it may be to conceive one eternal being without a cause of its existence it is not less difficult to conceive an eternal succession of beings deriving their existence from each other for though every link be supposed a production the chain itself exists without a cause as well as one eternal being does therefore an eternal succession of beings is not a more natural supposition than one eternal selfexistent being and taking it in a different light it will appear a supposition much less natural or rather altogether unnatural succession in existence implying the successive annihilation of particulars is indeed a very natural conception but then it is intimately connected with frail and dependent beings and cannot without the utmost violence to the conception be applied to the maker of all things to whom we naturally ascribe perpetual existence and every other perfection and therefore as this hypothesis of a perpetual succession when applied to the deity is destitute of any support from reason or experience and is contradicted by every one of our natural feelings there can be no ground for adopting it  the noted observation of lucretius that primos in orb deos fecit timor may be objected as it will be thought unphilosophical to multiply causes for our belief of a deity when fear alone must have that effect for my part i have little doubt of the truth of the observation taking it in its proper sense that fear is the foundation of our belief of invisible malevolent powers for it is evident that fear can never be the cause of our belief of a benevolent deity i have unfolded in another essay of our dread of supernatural powers in the dark  the cause of our dread of malevolent invisible powers and i am persuaded that nothing has been more hurtful to religion than the irregular propensity in our nature to dread such powers superficial thinkers are apt to confound these phantoms of the imagination with the objects of our true and genuine perceptions and finding so little reality in the former they are apt to conclude the latter also to be a fiction but if they gave any sort of deliberate attention they would soon learn by the assistance of history if not by original feeling to distinguish these objects as having no real connection with each other man in his original savage state is a shy and timorous animal dreading every new object and attributing every extraordinary event to some invisible malevolent power led at the same time by mere appetite he has little idea of regularity and order of the morality of actions or of the beauty of nature in this state it is no wonder he multiplies his invisible malevolent powers without entertaining any notion of a supreme being the creator of all things as man ripens in society and is benefited by the goodwill of others his dread of new objects gradually lessens he begins to perceive regularity and order in the course of nature he becomes sharpsighted in discovering causes from effects and effects from causes he ascends gradually through the different orders of beings and their operations till he discovers the deity who is the cause of all things and when we run over the history of man it will be found to hold true in fact that savages who are most possessed with the opinion of evil spirits have of all people the least idea of a deity and that as all civilized nations without exception entertain the firm belief of a deity so the dread of evil spirits wears out in every nation in proportion to their gradual advances in social intercourse  and this leads to a reflection which cannot fail to have universal influence man in a savage and brutish state is hurried away by every gust of passion and by every phantom of the imagination his powers and faculties are improved by education and good culture he acquires deep knowledge in the nature of things and learns accurately to distinguish truth from falsehood what more satisfying evidence can we require of the truth of our perceptions of the deity than to find these perceptions prevalent in proportion as mankind improve in the arts of life these perceptions go hand in hand with the rational powers as man increases in knowledge and in the discerning faculties his perceptions of the deity become proportionally more strong clear and authoritative the universal conviction of a deity which has without exception spread through all civilized nations cannot possibly be without a foundation in nature to insist that it may is to insist that an effect may be without an adequate cause reason cannot be an adequate cause because our reasonings upon this subject must at best be abstruse and beyond the comprehension of the bulk of mankind our knowledge therefore of the deity must be founded on our perceptions and feelings which are common to mankind and it is agreeable to the analogy of nature that god should discover himself to his rational creatures after this manner if this subject be involved in any degree of obscurity writers are to blame who in a matter of so great importance ought to give no quarter to inaccuracy of thought or expression but it is an error common to the bulk of writers to substitute reason for feeling the faculty of perception working silently and without effort is generally overlookt and we must find a reason for every thing we judge to be true though the truth of the proposition often depends not upon reasoning but upon mere feeling it is thus that morality has been brought under some obscurity by metaphysical writers and it is equally to be regreted that the knowledge of the deity has been brought under obscurity by the same sort of writers  having settled the belief of a deity upon its proper basis we shall proceed to take a general view of the attributes which belong to that great being and first  of the unity of the deity with regard to this and all the other attributes of the deity it ought to be no discouraging reflection that we cannot attain an adequate idea of them the deity is too grand an object to be comprehended in any perfect manner by the human mind we have not words nor ideas which any way correspond to the manner of his existence should some good angel undertake to be our instructor we would still be at a loss to form a distinct conception of it power intelligence and goodness are attributes which we can comprehend but with regard to the nature of the deity in general and the manner of his existence we must be satisfied in this mortal state to remain much in the dark the attribute of unity is what of all we can have the least certainty about by the light of nature it is not inconsistent that there should be two or more beings of the very highest order whose essence and actions are so regulated by the nature of the beings themselves as to be altogether concordant and harmonious in truth the nature of the divine being is so far out of our reach that we must be absolutely at a loss to apply to it unity or multiplicity this property applies to numbers and to individual things but we know not that it will apply to the deity at the same time if we may venture to judge of a matter so remote from common apprehension we ought to conclude in favors of the attribute of unity we perceive the necessity of admitting one eternal being and it is sufficient that there is not the smallest foundation from sense or reason to suppose more than one  of the power and intelligence of the deity these two attributes i join together because the same reflection will apply to both the wisdom and power which must necessarily be supposed in the creation and government of this world are so far beyond the reach of our comprehension that they may justly be styled infinite we can ascribe no bounds to either and we have no other notion of infinite but that to which we can ascribe no bounds  of the benevolence of the deity the mixed nature of the events which fall under our observation seems at first sight to point out a mixed cause partly good and partly evil the author of philosophical essays concerning human understanding in his eleventh essay of the practical consequences of natural religion puts in the mouth of an epicurean philosopher a very shrewd argument against the benevolence of the deity the sum of it is what follows if the cause be known only by the effect we never ought to assign to it any qualities beyond what are precisely requisite to produce the effect allowing therefore god to be the author of the existence and order of the universe it follows that he possesses that precise degree of power intelligence and benevolence which appears in his workmanship and hence from the present seen of things apparently so full of ill and disorder it is concluded that we have no foundation for ascribing any attribute to the deity but what is precisely commensurate with the imperfection of this world with regard to mankind an exception is made in works of human art and contrivance it is admitted that we can advance from the effect to the cause and returning back from the cause that we conclude new effects which have not yet existed thus for instance from the sight of a halffinished building surrounded with heaps of stones and mortar and all the instruments of masonry we naturally conclude that the building will be finished and receive all the farther improvements which art can bestow upon it but the foundation of this reasoning is plainly that man is a being whom we know by experience and whose motives and designs we are acquainted with which enables us to draw many inferences concerning what may be expected from him but did we know man only from the single work or production which we examine we could not argue in this manner because our knowledge of all the qualities which we ascribe to him being upon that supposition derived from the work or production it is impossible they could point any thing farther or be the foundation of any new inference  supposing reason to be our only guide in these matters which is supposed by this philosopher in his argument i cannot help seeing his reasoning to be just it appears to be true that by no inference of reason can i conclude any power or benevolence in the cause beyond what is displayed in the effect but this is no wonderful discovery the philosopher might have carried his argument a greater length he might have observed even with regard to a man i am perfectly acquainted with that i cannot conclude by any chain of reasoning he will finish the house he has begun it is to no purpose to urge his temper and disposition for from what principle of reason can i infer that these will continue the same as formerly he might further have observed that the difficulty is greater with regard to a man i know nothing of supposing him to have begun the building for what foundation have i to transfer the qualities of the persons i am acquainted with to strangers this surely is not performed by any process of reasoning there is still a wider step which is that reason will not help me out in attributing to the deity even that precise degree of power intelligence and benevolence which appears in his workmanship i find no inconsistency in supposing that a blind and undesigning cause may be productive of excellent effects it will i presume be difficult to produce a demonstration to the contrary and supposing at the instant of operation the deity to have been endued with these properties can we make out by any argument a priori that they are still subsisting in him nay this same philosopher might have gone a great way further by observing when any thing comes into existence that by no process of reasoning can we so much as infer any cause of its existence  but happily for man where reason fails him perception and feeling come to his assistance by means of principles implanted in our nature we are enabled to make the above conclusions and inferences as at full length is made out in some of the foregoing essays more particularly power discovered in any object is perceived as a permanent quality like figure or extension essay upon our knowledge of future events  upon this account power discovered by a single effect is considered as sufficient to produce the like effects without end further great power may be discovered from a small effect which holds even in bodily strength as where an action is performed readily and without effort this is equally remarkable in wisdom and intelligence a very short argument may unfold correctness of judgment and a deep reach the same holds in art and skill examining a slight piece of workmanship done with taste we readily observe that the artist was equal to a greater task but it is most of all remarkable in the quality of benevolence for even from a single effect produced by an unknown cause which appears to be accurately adapted to some good purpose we necessarily attribute to this cause benevolence as well as power and wisdom essay of our idea of power at the close  it is indeed but a weak perception which arises from a single effect but still it is a clear and distinct perception of pure benevolence without any mixture of malice for such contradictory qualities are not readily to be ascribed to the same cause there may be a difficulty indeed where the effect is of a mixed nature partly evil partly good or where a variety of effects having these opposite characters proceed from the same cause such intricate cases cannot fail to embarass us but as we must form some sentiment the resolution of the difficulty plainly is that we must ascribe benevolence or malevolence to the cause from the prevalence of the one or other quality in the effects if evil makes the greatest figure we perceive the cause to be malevolent notwithstanding of opposite instances of goodness if upon the whole goodness is supereminent we perceive the cause to be benevolent and are not moved by the cross instances of evil which we endeavor to reconcile as we can to pure benevolence it is indeeed true that where the opposite effects nearly balance each other our perception cannot be entire upon the side of benevolence or malevolence but if good or evil greatly preponderate the weight in the opposite scale goes for nothing the perception is entire upon one side or other because it is the tendency of our perceptions to reject a mixed character made up of benevolence and malevolence unless where it is necessarily pressed home upon us by an equality of opposite effects  such are the conclusions that we can with certainty draw not indeed from reason but from sense and feeling so little are we acquainted with the essence and nature of things that we cannot establish these conclusions upon any argument a priori nor would it be of great benefit to mankind to have these conclusions demonstrated to them few having either leisure or genius to deal in such profound speculations it is more wisely ordered that they appear to us intuitively certain we feel that they are true and our feelings have full authority over us this is a solid foundation for our conviction of the benevolence of the deity if from a single effect pure benevolence in the cause can be perceived or felt what doubt can there be of the pure benevolence of the deity when we survey his works pregnant with good will to mankind innumerable instances of things wisely adapted to good purposes give us the strongest feeling of the goodness as well as wisdom of the deity which is joined with the firmest persuasion of constancy and uniformity in his operations a few cross instances which to us weaksighted mortals may appear of evil tendency ought not and cannot make us waver when we know so little of nature it would be surprising indeed if we should be able to account for every event and its final tendency unless we were let into the counsels of the almighty we can never hope to unravel all the mysteries of the creation  as we cannot say too much upon a subject which is of all the most interesting i shall add some other considerations to justify our belief of the pure benevolence of the deity and in the first place i venture to lay it down for a truth that pure malice is a principle not to be found in human nature the benevolence of man is indeed often checked and counteracted by jealousy envy and other selfish passions but these are distinct from pure malice for pure goodness is not opposite to selfinterest but to satisfaction in the misfortunes and miseries of others now the independent and allsufficient nature of the deity sets him above all suspicion of being liable to envy or the pursuit of any interest other than the general interest of his creatures wants weakness and opposition of interests are the causes of ill will and malice among men from all such influences the deity must be exempted and therefore unless we suppose him less perfect than the creatures he has made we cannot readily suppose that there is any degree of malice in his nature  there is a second consideration which has always afforded me great satisfaction did natural evil prevail in reality as much as it does in appearance we must expect that the enlargement of natural knowledge should daily discover new instances of bad as well as of good intention but the fact is directly otherways our discoveries ascertain us more and more of the benevolence of the deity by unfolding beautiful final causes without number while the appearances of evil intention gradually vanish like a mist after the sun breaks out many things are now found to be curious in their contrivance and productive of good effects which formerly appeared useless or perhaps of evil tendency and in the gradual progress of learning we have the strongest reason to expect that many more discoveries of the like kind will be made hereafter this very consideration had we nothing else to rely on ought to make us rest upon the assurance which our feelings give us of the benevolence of the deity without giving way to the perplexity of a few cross appearances which in matters so far beyond our comprehension ought to be ascribed to our own ignorance and by no means to any malevolence in the deity  i shall satisfy myself with suggesting but one other observation that inferring a mixed nature in the deity from events which cannot be clearly reconciled to benevolence is at best new moulding the manichean system by substituting in place of it one really less plausible for i can with greater facility form a conception of two opposite powers governing the universe than of one power endued with great goodness and great malevolence which are principles repugnant to each other  it thus appears that our conviction of this attribute of pure benevolence has a wide and solid foundation it is impressed upon us by a natural feeling by every discovery we make in the science of nature and by every argument which is suggested by reason and reflection there is but one objection of any weight which can be moved against it arising from the difficulty of accounting for natural and moral evil it is observed above that this objection however it may puzzle ought not to shake our faith in this attribute because an argument from ignorance can never be a convincing argument in any case and this therefore in its strongest light appears but in the shape of a difficulty not of a solid objection at the same time as the utmost labor of thought is well bestowed upon a subject in which mankind is so much interested i shall proceed to suggest some reflections which may tend to satisfy us that the instances commonly given of natural and moral evil are not so inconsistent with pure benevolence as at first sight may be imagined  one preliminary point must be settled which i presume will be admitted without much hesitation it certainly will not be thought in any degree inconsistent with the pure benevolence of the deity that the world is filled with an endless variety of creatures gradually ascending in the scale of being from the most grovelling to the most glorious to think otherways would be in effect to think that all inanimate beings ought to be endued with life and motion and that all animate beings ought to be angels if at first view it shall be thought that infinite power and goodness cannot stop short of absolute perfection in their operations and that the work of creation must be confined to the highest order of beings in the highest perfection this thought will soon be corrected by considering that by this supposition a great void is left which according to the present system of things is filled with beings and with life and motion and supposing the world to be replenished with the highest order of beings created in the highest degree of perfection it is certainly an act of more extensive benevolence to complete the work of creation by the addition of an infinity of creatures less perfect than to leave a great blank betwixt beings of the highest order and nothing  the imperfection then of a created being abstractly considered is no impeachment of any of the attributes of the deity whether power wisdom or benevolence and if so neither can pain abstractly considered be an impeachment so far as it is the natural and necessary consequence of imperfection the government of the world is carried on by general laws which produce constancy and uniformity in the operations of nature among many reasons for this we can clearly discover one which is unfolded in a former essay of our knowledge of future events  that were not nature uniform and constant men and other sensible beings would be altogether at a loss how to conduct themselves our nature is adjusted to these general laws and must therefore be subjected to all their varieties whether beneficial or hurtful we are made sensible beings and therefore equally capable of pleasure and pain and it must follow from the very nature of the thing that delicacy of feeling which is the source of much pleasure may be equally the source of much pain it is true we cannot pronounce it to be a contradiction that a being should be susceptible of pleasure only and not of pain but no argument can be founded upon this supposition but what will conclude that a creature such as man ought to have no place in the scale of beings which surely will not be maintained for it is still better that man be as he is than not be at all it is further to be observed in general that aversion to pain is not so great at least in mankind as to counterbalance every other appetite most men would purchase an additional share of happiness at the expense of some pain and therefore it can afford no argument against the benevolence of the deity that created beings are found liable to pain from their nature and condition supposing in the main their life to be comfortable their state is still preferable to that of inanimate matter capable neither of pleasure nor pain  thus then it appears even from a general view of our subject that natural evil affords no argument against the benevolence of the deity and this will still appear in a stronger light when we go to particulars it is fully laid open in the first essay that the social affections even when most painful are accompanied with no degree of aversion whether in the feeling itself or in the after reflection we value ourselves the more for being so affected being conscious that it is right and meet to be so affected distresses therefore of this sort cannot be called evils when we have no aversion to them and do not repine at them and if these be laid aside what may be justly termed natural evils will be reduced within a small compass they will be found to proceed necessarily and by an established train of causes and effects either from the imperfection of our nature or from the operation of general laws pain is not distributed through the world blindly or with any appearance of malice but ends proportions and measures are observed in the distribution sensible marks of good tendency are conspicuous even in the harshest dispensations of providence as well as in its general laws and the good tendency of these general laws is a sure pledge of benevolence even in those instances where we may be at a loss about their application one thing is certain that there is in man a natural principle to submit to these general laws and their consequences and were this principle cultivated as it ought to be mankind would have the same consciousness of rectitude of conduct in submitting to the laws of the natural world that they have in submitting to the laws of the moral world and would as little repine at the distresses of the one kind as at those of the other  but we cannot do justice to the argument unless we proceed further to show that pain and distress are productive of manifold good ends and that the present system could not well be without them in the first place pain is necessary as a monitor of what is hurtful and dangerous to life every man is trusted with the care of his own preservation and he would be ill qualified for this trust were he left entirely to the guidance of reason he would die for want of food were it not for the pain of hunger and but for the pain arising from fear he would precipitate himself every moment into the most destructive enterprises in the next place pain is the great sanction of laws both human and divine there would be no order nor discipline in the world without it in the third place the distresses and disappointments which arise from the uncertainty of seasons from the variable tempers of those we are connected with and from other cross accidents are wonderfully well adapted to our constitution by keeping our hopes and fears in perpetual agitation man is an active being and is not in his element but when in variety of occupation a constant and uniform tenor of life without hopes or fears however agreeable in itself would soon bring on satiety and disgust pain therefore is necessary not only to enhance our pleasures but to keep us in perpetual motion and it is needless to observe a second time that to complain of mans constitution in this respect is in other words to complain that there is such a creature as man in the scale of being and to mention but one other thing pain and distress have a wonderful tendency to advance the interests of society grief compassion and sympathy are strong connecting principles by which every particular man is made subservient to the general good of the whole species  i shall close this branch of my subject with a general reflection which is reserved to the last place because in my apprehension it brings the argument for the benevolence of the deity within a very narrow compass when we run over what we know of the formation and government of this world the instances are without number of good intention and of consummate wisdom in adjusting things to good ends and purposes and it is equally true that as we advance in knowledge scenes of this kind multiply upon us this observation is enforced above but i have now to observe that there is not a single instance to be met with which can be justly ascribed to malevolence or bad intention many evils may be pointed out evils at least as to us but when the most is made of such instances they appear only to be the consequences of general laws which regard the whole more than particulars and therefore are no marks of malevolence in the author and governor of the world were there any doubt about the tendency of such instances it would be more rational to ascribe them to want of power than want of benevolence which is so conspicuous in other instances but we cannot rationally ascribe them to either but to the preestablished order and constitution of things and to the necessary imperfection of the nature of all created beings and after all laying the greatest weight upon these natural evils that can reasonably be demanded the account stands thus instances without number of benevolence in the frame and government of this world so direct and clear as not to admit of the smallest dubiety on the other side natural evils are stated which at best are very doubtful instances of malevolence and may be ascribed perhaps obscurely to another cause in balancing this account where the evil appearances are so far outnumbered by the good why should we hesitate a moment to ascribe pure benevolence to the deity and to conclude these evils to be necessary defects in a good constitution especially when it is so repugnant to our natural feelings to ascribe great benevolence and great malevolence to the same being  it will be observed that in answering the above objection to the benevolence of the deity i have avoided urging any argument from our future existence though it affords a fruitful field of comfort greatly overbalancing the transitory evils of this life but i should scarce think it fair reasoning to urge such topics upon this subject which would be arguing in a circle because the benevolence of the deity is the only solid principle from whence we can infer a future existence  having dispatched what occurred upon natural evil we come now to consider moral evil as an objection against the benevolence of the deity and some writers urge this objection so far as to conclude that god is the cause of moral evil since he has given man a constitution by which moral evil does and must abound it is certainly no satisfying answer to this objection that moral evil is the necessary consequence of human liberty when human liberty must at best appear a doubtful fact and even admitting of human liberty it is a very possible supposition that man might have been endued with a moral sense so lively and strong as to be absolutely authoritative over his actions waving therefore the argument from human liberty we must look about for a more solid answer to the objection which will not be difficult when we consider this matter as laid down in a former essay essay upon liberty and necessity  it is there made out it is hoped to the satisfaction of the reader that human actions are all of them directed by general laws which have an operation not less infallible than those laws have which govern mere matter that the feeling we have of liberty does not correspond to the truth of things and that our peculiar manner of conceiving human actions as right or wrong and as praise or blame worthy is wholly founded on this deceitful feeling the final cause of this singular feeling is also there laid open that it is happily adjusted to the nature of man as an imperfect being and tends to promote virtue in an eminent degree this discovery affords a solid answer to an objection which so far as i know has not hitherto received any good answer and it is that the objection rests entirely upon a false supposition as if human actions were seen in the same light by the deity in which they are seen by men a feeling which is not agreeable to the truth of things though wisely ordered to correct an imperfect constitution in man cannot be ascribed to a perfect being the deity perceiving all things as they are without disguise knows that what is termed moral evil in the language of man is as well as moral good the result of general laws and of a necessary connection betwixt causes and their effects every thing possesses its proper place in his plan all our actions contribute equally to carry on the great and good designs of providence and therefore there is nothing which in his sight is evil at least nothing which is evil upon the whole  considering the objection in the above light which is the true one it loses its force for it certainly will not be maintained as an argument against the goodness of the deity that he endued mankind with a sense of moral evil which in reality is one of the greatest blessings bestowed upon him and which eminently distinguishes him from the brute creation  but if now the objection be turned into another shape and it be demanded why was not every man endued with so strong a sense of morality as to be completely authoritative over all his principles of action which would prevent much remorse to himself and much mischief to others it is answered first that this would not be sufficient for an exact regularity of conduct unless mans judgment of right and wrong were also infallible for as long as we differ about what is yours and what is mine injustice must be the consequence in many instances however innocent we be but in the next place to complain of a defect in the moral sense is to complain that we are not perfect creatures and if this complaint be well founded we may with equal justice complain that our understanding is but moderate and that in general our powers and facultics are limited why should it be urged as an objection that the moral sense is imperfect when all our senses internal and external are imperfect in short if this complaint be in any measure just it must go the length as above observed to prove that it is not consistent with the benevolence of the deity to create such a being as man  conclusion we have thus gone through a variety of subjects not without labor and expense of thought and now like a traveller who after examining the different parts of a country ascends some eminence to review the whole let us refresh ourselves by looking back and enjoying the discoveries we have made  the subject of these essays is man we have formed no imaginary schemes for exalting or for depressing his nature the inquiry has been whither his capacities and powers suit his present circumstances and fit him for acting a proper part in life we begin with examining some of the great springs of action upon accurate scrutiny it is found that selflove or desire of good is not our sole principle of action but that we are furnished besides with a variety of impelling powers mingled in society for the convenience of mutual help it is necessary that we feel for each other but as the feeling for anothers sorrow cannot but be painful here is traced an admirable contrivance to reconcile us to this virtuous pain by taking off that aversion to pain which in all other cases is an overruling principle this explains a seemingly strange phenomenon that we should seek entertainment from representations which immerse us in the deepest affliction from man as a social we proceed to man as a moral agent we find him sensible of beauty in different ranks and orders and eminently sensible of it in its highest order that of sentiment action and character but the sense of moral beauty is not alone sufficient the importance of morality requires some stronger principle to guard it some checks and restraints from vice more severe than mere disapprobation these are not wanting to the sense of beauty is superadded a sense of obligation a feeling of right and wrong which constitutes a law within us this law enjoins the primary virtues those which are essential to society under the strictest sanctions pain the strongest monitor is here employed to check transgression whilst in the sublimer more heroic parts of virtue where strict obligation ends pleasure is employed to reward the performance to nothing are we prompted as a duty for which we are not first prepared by some inward principle an exact proportion is maintained betwixt the strength of our internal principles and their usefulness from self the object of our most essential principles affection spreads through all the connections we have with others whether formed by natural ties founded on gratitude or created by sympathy with the distressed till among persons indifferent and unknown affection is gradually lost arrived at that point where benevolence would vanish by the distance of the object nature has an admirable artifice for reviving its force by directing it on the abstract idea of a public and a whole which though faint and obscure in the conception is yet equal to any of our ideas in force and energy man is in this manner furnished for acting a proper and useful part in the system to which he belongs but this system could not be regulated upon any preadjusted plan the actions of man could not proceed with any order nor be subject to any government unless all were necessarily determined by motives at the same time man could not well conceive himself to be a moral without conceiving himself also to be a free agent hence the necessity of giving his mind a peculiar cast in which we cannot but discern the brightest characters of designing wisdom by having his practical ideas and his moral feelings formed upon an imaginary state of liberty conscience exerts its power over him with full authority and scope is given for a far richer and more diversified scene of action than the perpetual consciousness of necessity could have admitted having shown that morals are established on an immovable foundation we proceed to show by what inward powers we are led to the knowledge and belief of some of the most necessary truths particularly that which it most imports us to know the existence of the deity to this we pave the way by a full preparation of reasoning we first consider the nature of that act of the mind which is termed belief of which the immediate foundation is the testimony of our senses if the testimony they give to the real existence of a material world be a mere illusion as some have held all belief founded on our own feelings is at an end hence there appears a necessity for establishing the authority of our senses and here we find full satisfaction for in other cases where there is any thing like artifice in the conduct of nature means are afforded both of discovering the truth and of discovering the end for which artifice is made use of to conceal the truth she never deceives us in vain but in the case of external existences we find nothing after the strictest scrutiny but presumptions hypotheses and fallacious reasonings opposed to the clearest testimony which nature can give dispersing with no great labor that philosophic dust which skeptics have raised about material substance we find it no more difficult to be conceived than qualities both being equally displayed to us by a peculiar modification of the sense of sight but belief is not more solidly founded upon our external senses than upon our internal feelings not the greatest skeptic ever doubted of his own personal identity continued through the successive periods of life of his being the same man this year he was the last which however is a discovery made by no reasoning resting wholly upon a simple feeling or inward sense and consciousness of the fact upon a like foundation rests our belief of cause and effect no relation is more familiar nor sooner takes hold of the mind than this yet certain it is that no reasoning no experience can discover the power or energy of what we term a cause when we attempt to trace it to its source it is necessary for the wellbeing of man first that he should perceive the objects which exist around him and next that he should perceive them in their true state not detached and loose but as causes and effects as producing and produced nature has furnished us with external senses for the perception of objects not only as simply existing but as existing thus related to each other nor without such faculties could we ever have attained the idea of cause and effect the same provision is made by nature in another case not less remarkable than the former our senses can only inform us of objects as presently existing yet nothing is more common than from our knowledge of the present and our experience of the past to reason to the future now all reasonings about futurity which have such extensive influence on our conduct would be utterly destitute of a foundation were we not endowed with a sense of uniformity and constancy in the operations of nature a secret instinct founds this conclusion that the future will be like the past thus there is established a marvelous harmony betwixt our inward feelings and the course of external events in the above mentioned instances we attribute to our boasted reason what in truth is performed by sense or instinct without knowing it to be such we trust to it we act upon its informations with equal confidence as we do upon the clearest conclusions of reason and in fact it does not oftener deceive us nature thus most effectually provides for our instruction in things most necessary to be known but this is not all we pursue the argument into a sort of intuitive demonstration of the deity he has not left us to collect his existence from abstract or uncertain arguments but has made us feel that he exists when external objects are presented to our view some are immediately distinguished to be effects not by any process or deduction of reasoning but merely by sight which gives us the perception of cause and effect just in the same manner this whole world is seen or discovered to be an effect produced by some invisible designing cause this argument cannot be invalidated without introducing universal skepticism without overthrowing all that is built upon the feelings which in many capital instances govern our judgments and actions and without obliging us to doubt of those things of which no man ever doubted for as in viewing an external object a particular modification of the sense of sight includes the idea of substance as well as of quality as a natural feeling makes us conceive some things as effects to be ascribed to a proper cause as from experience of the past instinct prompts us to judge of the future in fine as by the feeling of identity the reader is conscious of being the same person he was when he began to read as all these conclusions i say upon which mankind rest with the fullest assurance are the dictates of senses external and internal in the very same way and upon the same evidence we conclude the existence of a first supreme cause reason when applied to gives us all its aid both to confirm the certainty of his being and to discover his perfections from effects so great and so good as those we see through the universe we necessarily infer the cause to be both great and good mixed or imperfect qualities cannot belong to him the difficulties from apparent evil are found capable of a satisfactory solution all the general laws of the universe are confessedly wise and good pain is found not to be useful only but necessary in the present system if this be an argument of an imperfect state yet must it not be admitted that somewhere in the scale of existence an imperfect order of beings must be found and why not man such a being unless we extravagantly demand that to prove the benevolence of the deity all the possible orders of being should be advanced to the top of the scale and all be left void and waste below no life no existence allowed except what is perfect the more of nature is explored and known the less of evil appears new discoveries of wisdom order and good intention have always kept pace with increasing learning and knowledge an intimation not obscure of its being owing to our imperfect discoveries and bounded views that evil is supposed to take place at all now when we consider all these things in one view so many striking instances of final causes such undeniable proofs both of wise design and skilful execution in place of indulging cold distrust of the great universal cause are we not raised to the highest admiration is there not somewhat in this subject that has power to kindle a noble enthusiasm and that will justify us for attempting a higher strain  for do not all these wonders o eternal mind sovereign architect of all form a hymn to thy praise if in the dead inanimate works of nature thou art seen if in the verdure of the fields and the azure of the skies the ignorant rustic admires thy creative power how blind must that man be who looking into his own nature contemplating this living structure this moral frame discerns not thy forming hand what various and complicated machinery is here and regulated with what exquisite art whilst man pursues happiness as his chief aim thou bendest selflove into the social direction thou infusest the generous principle which makes him feel for sorrows not his own nor feels he only but strange indeed takes delight in rushing into foreign misery and with pleasure goes to drop the painful tear over real or imaginary woes thy divine hand thus strongly drew the connecting tie and linked man to man by a sympathetic power that nothing might be solitary or desolate in thy world but all tend and work toward mutual association for this great end he is not left to a loose or arbitrary range of will thy wise decree has erected within him a throne for virtue there thou have not decked her with beauty only to his admiring eye but thrown around her the awful effulgence of authority divine her persuasions have the force of a precept and her precepts are a law indispensible man feels himself bound by this law strict and immutable and yet the privilege of supererogating is left a field opened for free and generous action in which performing a glorious course he may attain the high reward by thee allotted of inward honor and selfestimation nothing is made superfluously severe nothing left dangerously loose in thy moral institution but every active principle made to know its proper place in just proportion mans affection diverges from himself to objects around him where the diverging rays too widely scattered begin to lose their warmth collecting them again by the idea of a public a country or the universe thou rekindlest the dying flame converging eagerly to this point behold how intense they glow and man though indifferent to each remote particular burns with zeal for the whole all things are by thee preordained great mover of all throughout the wide expanse every living creature runs a destined course whilst all under a law irresistible fulfill thy decrees man alone seems to himself exempt free to turn and bend his course at will yet is he not exempt but under the impression of freedom ministers in every action to thy decree omniponent as much as the rolling sun or ebbing flood what strange contradictions are in thy great scheme reconciled what glaring opposites made to agree necessity and liberty meet in the same agent yet interfere not he imagines himself free yet is under the bonds of necessity he discovers himself to be a necessary agent and yet continues to act as he were free within the heart of man thou have placed thy lamp to direct his otherways uncertain steps by this light he is not only assured of the existence and entertained with all the glories of the material world but is enabled to penetrate into the recesses of nature he perceives objects joined together by the mysterious link of cause and effect the connecting principle though he can never explain he is made to feel and is thus instructed how to refer even things unknown to their proper origin nay he is taught by thee to prophesy things to come where reason is unavailing instinct comes in aid and bestows a power of divination which discovers the future by the past thus thou gradually liftest him up to the knowledge of thyself the plain and simple sense which in the most obvious effect reads and perceives a cause brings him straight to thee the first great cause the ancient of days the eternal source of all thou presentest thyself to us and we cannot avoid thee we must doubt of our own existence if we call in question thine we see thee by thine own light we see thee not existing only but in wisdom and in benevolence supreme as in existence first as spots in the suns bright orb so in the universal plan scattered evils are lost in the blaze of superabundant goodness even by the research of human reason weak as it is those seeming evils diminish and fly away apace objects supposed superfluous or noxious have assumed a beneficial aspect how much more to thine all penetrating eye must all appear excellent and fair it must be so we cannot doubt neither imperfection nor malice dwell with thee thou appointest as salutary what we lament as painful what mortals term sin thou pronouncest to be only error for moral evil vanishes in some measure from before thy more perfect sight and as at the beginning of days thou saw so thou see and pronouncest still that every thing thou have made is good
