love for love a comedy acted at the theater in littlelincolnsinnfields by his majestys servants  written by mr congreve  nudus agris nudus nummis paternis insanire parat certa ratione modoque hor the fourth edition  london printed for jacob tonson and sold by r wellington g strahan and b lintott   0   to the right honorable charles earl of dorset and middlesex lord chamberlain of his majestys household and knight of the most noble order of the garter etc my lord a young poet is liable to the same vanity and indiscretion with a young lover and the great man that smiles upon one and the fine woman that looks kindly upon the other are each of em in danger of having the favor published with the first opportunity  but there may be a different motive which will a little distinguish the offenders for though one should have a vanity in ruining anothers reputation yet the other may only have an ambition to advance his own and i beg leave my lord that i may plead the latter both as the cause and excuse of this dedication  whoever is king is also the father of his country and as no body can dispute your lordships monarchy in poetry so all that are concerned ought to acknowledge your universal patronage and it is only presuming on the privilege of a loyal subject that i have ventured to make this my address of thanks to your lordship which at the same time includes a prayer for your protection  i am not ignorant of the common form of poetical dedications which are generally made up of panegyricks where the authors endeavor to distinguish their patrons by the shining characters they give them above other men but that my lord is not my business at this time nor is your lordship now to be distinguished i am contented with the honor i do my self in this epistle without the vanity of attempting to add to or explain your lordships character  i confess it is not without some struggling that i behave my self in this case as i ought for it is very hard to be pleased with a subject and yet forbear it but i choose rather to follow plinys precept than his example when in his panegyric to the emperor trajan he says nec minus considerabo quid aures ejus pati possint quam quid virtutibus debeatur   i hope i may be excused the pedantry of a quotation when it is so justly applied here are some lines in the print and which your lordship read before this play was acted that were omitted on the stage and particularly one whole scene in the third act which not only helps the design forward with less precipitation but also heightens the ridiculous character of foresight which indeed seems to be maimed without it but i found my self in great danger of a long play and was glad to help it where i could though notwithstanding my care and the kind reception it had from the town i could heartily wish it yet shorter but the number of different characters represented in it would have been too much crowded in less room  this reflection on prolixity a fault for which scarce any one beauty will atone warns me not to be tedious now and detain your lordship any longer with the trifles of  my lord your lordships most obedient and most humble servant william congreve  a prologue for the opening of the new playhouse proposed to be spoken by mrs bracegirdle in mans clothes sent from an unknown hand custom which every where bears mighty sway brings me to act the orator to day but women you will say are ill at speeches it is true and therefore i appear in breeches not for example to you citywives that by prescriptions settled for your lives was it for gain the husband first consented o yes their gains are mightily augmented making horns with her hands over her head and yet methinks it must have cost some strife a passive husband and an active wife it is awkward very awkward by my life but to my speech assemblies of all nations still are supposed to open with orations mine shall begin to show our obligations to you our benefactors lowly bowing whose favors have prevented our undoing a long egyptian bondage we endured till freedom by your justice we procured our taskmasters were grown such very jews we must at length have played in wooden shoos had not your bounty taught us to refuse freedoms of english growth i think alone what for lost english freedom can atone a freeborn player loathes to be compelled our rulers tyrannized and we rebelled freedom the wise mans wish the poor mans wealth which you and i and most of us enjoy by stealth the soul of pleasure and the sweet of life the womans charter widow maid or wife this they would have cancelled and thence grew the strife but you perhaps would have me here confess how we obtained the favor  cannot you guess why then i will tell you for i hate a lie by bribry errant bribry let me die i was their agent but by jove i swear no honorable member had a share though young and able members bid me fair i chose a wiser way to make you willing which has not cost the house a single shilling now you suspect at least i went a billing y see i am young and to that air of youth some will add beauty and a little truth these powerful charms improved by powerful arts prevailed to captivate your opening hearts thus furnished i preferred my poor petition and bribed ye to commiserate our condition i laughed and sighed and sung and leerd upon ye with roguish loving looks and that way won ye the young men kissed me and the old i kissed and luringly i led them as i list the ladies in mere pity took our parts pitys the darling passion of their hearts thus bribing or thus bribed fear no disgraces for thus you may take bribes and keep your places prologue spoken at the opening of the new house by mr betterton the husbandman in vain renews his toil to cultivate each tear a hungry soil and fondly hopes for rich and generous fruit when what should feed the tree devours the root the unlanden boughs he sees bode certain dearth unless transplanted to more kindly earth so the poor husbands of the stage who found their labors lost upon the ungrateful ground this last and only remedy have proved and hope new fruit from ancient stocks removed well may they hope when you so kindly aid and plant a soil which you so rich have made as nature gave the world to mans first age so from your bounty we receive this stage the freedom man was born to you have restored and to our world such plenty you afford it seems like eden fruitful of its own accord but since in paradise frail flesh gave way and when but two were made both went astray forbear your wonder and the fault forgive if in our larger family we grieve one falling adam and one tempted eve we who remain would gratefully repay what our endeavors can and bring this day the firstfruit offering of a virgin play we hope there is something that may please each taste and though of homely fare we make the feast yet you will find variety at least there is humor which for cheerful friends we got and for the thinking party there is a plot we have something too to gratify ill nature if there be any here and that is satire though satire scarce dares grin it is grown so mild or only shows its teeth as if it smiled as asses thistles poets mumble wit and dare not bite for fear of being bit they hold their pens as swords are held by fools and are afraid to use their own edgetools since the plaindealers scenes of manly rage not one has dared to lash this crying age this time the poet owns the bold essay yet hopes there is no ill manners in his play and he declares by me he has designed affront to none but frankly speaks his mind and should the ensuing scenes not chance to hit he offers but this one excuse twas writ before your late encouragement of wit epilogue spoken at the opening of the new house by mrs bracegirdle sure providence at first designed this place to be the players refuge in distress for still in every storm they all run hither as to a shed that shields em from the weather but thinking of this change which last befell us it is like what i have heard our poets tell us for when behind our scenes their suits are pleading to help their love sometimes they show their reading and wanting ready cash to pay for hearts they top their learning on us and their parts once of philosophers they told us stories whom as i think they called  py  pythagories i am sure it is some such latin name they give em and we who know no better must believe em now to these men say they such souls were given that after death never went to hell nor heaven but lived i know not how in beasts and then when many years were past in men again methinks we players resemble such a soul that does from bodies we from houses stroll thus aristotles soul of old that was may now be damned to animate an ass or in this very house for ought we know is doing painful penance in some beau and this our audience which did once resort to shining theaters to see our sport now find us tossed into a tenniscourt these walls but the other day were filled with noise of roaring gamesters and your damme boys then bounding balls and rackets they encompassed and now they are filled with jests and flights and bombast i vow i dont much like this transmigration strolling from place to place by circulation grant heaven we dont return to our first station i know not what these think but for my part i cannot reflect without an aching heart how we should end in our original a cart but we cannot fear since youre so good to save us that you have only set us up to leave us thus from the past we hope for future grace i beg it  and some here know i have a begging face then pray continue this your kind behavior for a clear stage will not do without your favor personae dramatis men sir sampson legend father to

and therefore resolve to rail at all that have and in that i but follow the examples of the wisest and wittiest men in all ages these poets and philosophers whom you naturally hate for just such another reason because they abound in sense and you are a fool   jere ay sir i am a fool i know it and yet heaven help me i am poor enough to be a wit  but i was always a fool when i told you what your expenses would bring you to your coaches and your liveries your treats and your balls your being in love with a lady that did not care a farthing for you in your prosperity and keeping company with wits that cared for nothing but your prosperity and now when you are poor hate you as much as they do one another   val well and now i am poor i have an opportunity to be revenged on em all i will pursue angelica with more love than ever and appear more notoriously her admirer in this restraint than when i openly rivaled the rich fops that made court to her so shall my poverty be a mortification to her pride and perhaps make her compassionate the love which has principally reduced me to this lowness of fortune and for the wits i am sure i am in a condition to be even with them    jere nay your condition is pretty even with theirs that is the truth on it   val i will take some of their trade out of their hands   jere now heaven of mercy continue the tax upon paper you dont mean to write   val yes i do i will write a play   jere hem  sir if you please to give me a small certificate of three lines  only to certify those whom it may concern that the bearer hereof jeremy

any future authority over him    val no sirrah you shall live with me still   jere sir it is impossible  i may die with you starve with you or be damned with your works but to live even three days the life of a play i no more expect it than to be cannonizd for a muse after my decease   val you are witty you rogue i shall want your help  i will have you learn to make couplets to tag the ends of acts do you hear get the maids to crambo in an evening and learn the knack of rhiming you may arrive at the height of a song sent by an unknown hand or a chocolatehouse lampoon   jere but sir is this the way to recover your fathers favor why sir sampson will be irreconcilable if your younger brother should come from sea he would never look upon you again youre undone sir youre ruined you will not have

bansteaddowns is nothing to it for a whetter yet i never see it but the spirit of famine appears to me sometimes like a decayed porter worn out with pimping and carrying billetdoux and songs not like other porters for hire but for the jests sake now like a thin chairman melted down to half his proportion with carrying a poet upon tick to visit some great fortune and his fare to be paid him like the wages of sin either at the day of marriage or the day of death   val very well sir can you proceed   jere sometimes like a bilkd bookseller with a meagre terrified countenance that looks as if he had written for himself or were resolved to turn author and bring the rest of his brethren into the same condition and lastly in the form of a wornout punk with verses in her hand which her vanity had preferred to settlements without a whole tatter to her tail but as ragged as one of the muses or as if she were carrying her linen to the papermill to be converted into folio books of warning to all young maids not to prefer poetry to good sense or lying in the arms of a needy wit before the embraces of a wealthy fool   enter scandal scan what jeremy holding forth   val the rogue has with all the wit he could muster up been declaiming against wit   scan ay why then i am afraid jeremy has wit for wherever it is it is always contriving its own ruin   jere why so i have been telling my master sir mr scandal for heavens sake sir try if you can dissuade him from turning poet   scan poet he shall turn soldier first and rather depend upon the outside of his head than the lining why what the devil has not your poverty made you enemies enough must you needs show your wit to get more   jere ay more indeed for who cares for any body that has more wit than himself   scan jeremy speaks like an oracle dont you see how worthless great men and dull rich rogues avoid a witty man of small fortune why he looks like a writ of enquiry into their titles and estates and seems commissioned by heaven to seize the better half   val therefore i would rail in my writings and be revenged   scan rail at whom the whole world impotent and vain who would die a martyr to sense in a country where the religion is folly you may stand at bay for a while but when the full cry is against you you will not have fair play for your life if you cannot be fairly run down by the hounds you will be treacherously shot by the huntsmen  no turn pimp flatterer quack lawyer parson be chaplain to an atheist or stallion to an old woman any thing but poet a modern poet is worse more servile timorous and fawning than any i have named without you could retrieve the ancient honors of the name recall the stage of athens and be allowed the force of open honest satire   val you are as inveterate against our poets as if your character had been lately exposed upon the stage  nay i am not violently bent upon the trade  one knocks jeremy see who is there ex jeremy but tell me what you would have me do

voluntary debts   scan and you like a true great man having engaged their attendance and promised more than ever you intend to perform are more perplexed to find evasions than you would be to invent

my right to his estate after his death to my younger brother he will immediately furnish me with four thousand pound to pay my debts and make my fortune this was once proposed before and i refused it but the present impatience of my creditors for their money and my own impatience of confinement and absence from angelica force me to consent   scan a very desperate demonstration of your love to angelica and i think she has never given you any assurance of hers   val you know her temper she never gave me any great reason either for hope or despair   scan women of her airy temper as they seldom think before they act so they rarely give us any light to guess at what they mean but you have little reason to believe that a woman of this age who has had an indifference for you in your prosperity will fall in love with your ill fortune besides angelica has a great fortune of her own and great fortunes either expect another great fortune or a fool   enter jeremy jere more misfortunes

he is a mender of reputations   scan a mender of reputations ay just as he is a keeper of secrets another virtue that he sets up for in the same manner for the rogue will speak aloud in the posture of a whisper and deny a womans name while he gives you the marks of her person he will forswear receiving a letter from her and at the same time show you her hand upon the superscription and yet perhaps he has counterfeited the hand too and sworn to a truth but he hopes not to be believed and refuses the reputation of a ladies favor as a doctor says no to a bishopric only that it may be granted him  in short he is a public professor of secrecy and makes proclamation that he holds private intelligence  he is here   enter tattle tatt valentine good morrow scandal i am yours  that is when you speak well of me   scan that is when i am yours for while i am my own or any bodys else that will never happen   tatt how inhuman   val why tattle you need not be much concerned at any thing that he says for to converse with scandal is to play at losing loadum you must lose a good name to him before you can win it for your self   tatt but how barbarous that is and how unfortunate for him that the world shall think the better of any person for his calumniation  i thank heaven it has always been a part of my character to handle the reputation of others very tenderly   scan ay such rotten reputations as you have to deal with are to be handled tenderly indeed   tatt nay but why rotten why should you say rotten when you know not the persons of whom you speak how cruel that is   scan not

not what  but upon my reputation she did me wrong  well well that was malice  but i know the bottom of it she was bribed to that by one that we all know  a man too only to bring me into disgrace with a certain woman of quality    scan whom we all know   tatt no matter for that  yes yes every body knows  no doubt on it every body knows my secrets  but i soon satisfied the lady of my innocence for i told her  madam says i there are some persons who make it their business to tell stories and say this and that of one and the other and every thing in the world and says i if your grace    scan grace

roundness of her lips   scan no   tatt no   scan she says otherwise   tatt impossible   scan yes faith ask valentine else   tatt why then as i hope to be saved i believe a woman only obliges a man to secrecy that she may have the pleasure of telling her self   scan no doubt on it well but has she done you wrong or no you have had her ha   tatt though i have more honor than to tell first i have more manners than to contradict what a lady has declared   scan well you own it   tatt i am strangely surpised yes yes i cannot denyt if she taxes me with it   scan she will be here by and by she sees valentine every morning   tatt how   val she does me the favor  i mean of a visit sometimes i did not think she had granted more to any body   scan nor i faith  but tattle does not use to belie a lady it is contrary to his character  how one may be deceived in a woman valentine   tatt nay what do you mean gentlemen   scan i am resolved i will ask her   tatt o barbarous why did you not tell me    scan no you told us   tatt and bid me ask valentine   val what did i say i hope you will not bring me to confess an answer when you never asked me the question   tatt but gentlemen this is the most inhuman proceeding    val nay if you have known scandal thus long and cannot avoid such a palpable decoy as this was the ladies have a fine time whose reputations are in your keeping   enter jeremy jere sir mrs frail has sent to know if you are stirring   val show her up when she comes  exit jere tatt i will be gone   val you will meet her   tatt have you not a back way   val if there were you have more discretion than to give scandal such an advantage why your running away will prove all that he can tell her   tatt scandal you will not be so ungenerous  o i shall lose my reputation of secrecy for ever  i shall never be received but upon public days and my visits will never be admitted beyond a drawing room i shall never see a bedchamber again never be locked in a closet nor run behind a screen or under a table never be distinguished among the waitingwomen by the name of trusty mr tattle more  you will not be so cruel   val scandal have pity on him he will yield to any conditions   tatt any any terms   scan come then sacrifice half a dozen women of good reputation to me presently  come where are your familiar  and see that they are women of quality too the first quality    tatt it is very hard  will not a baronets lady pass   scan no nothing under a right honorable   tatt o inhuman you dont expect their names   scan no their titles shall serve   tatt alas that is the same thing pray spare me their titles i will describe their persons   scan well begin then but take notice if you are so ill a painter that i cannot know the person by your picture of her you must be condemned like other bad painters to write the name at the bottom   tatt well first then   enter mrs frail o unfortunate she is come already will you have patience till another time  i will double the number   scan well on that condition  take heed you dont fail me   mrs frail hey day i shall get a fine reputation by coming to see fellows in a morning scandal you devil are you here too oh mr tattle every thing is safe with you we know   scan tattle   tatt mum  o madam you do me too much honor   val well lady galloper how does angelica   frail angelica manners   val what you will allow an absent lover    frail no i will allow a lover present with his mistress to be particular  but otherwise i think his passion ought to give place to his manners   val but what if he have more passion than manners   frail then let him marry and reform   val marriage indeed may qualify the fury of his passion but it very rarely mends a mans manners   fil you are the most mistaken in the world there is no creature perfectly civil but a husband for in a little time he grows only rude to his wife and that is the highest good breeding for it begets his civility to other people well i will tell you news but i suppose you hear your brother benjamin is landed and my brother foresights daughter is come out of the country  i assure you there is a match talked of by the old people  well if he be but as great a seabeast as she is a landmonster we shall have a most amphibious breed  the progeny will be all otters he has been bred at sea and she has never been out of the country   val

own it i think there is no happiness like conversing with an agreeable man i dont quarrel at that nor i dont think but your conversation was very innocent but the place is public and to be seen with a man in a hackneycoach is scandalous what if any body else should have seen you alight as i did  how can any body be happy while they are in perpetual fear of being seen and censured  besides it would not only reflect upon you sister but me   frail pooh here is a clutter  why should it reflect upon you  i dont doubt but you have thought your self happy in a hackneycoach before now  if i had gone to

lie then   tatt yes if you would be well bred all wellbred persons lie  besides you are a woman you must never speak what you think your words must contradict your thoughts but your actions may contradict your words so when i ask you if you can love me you must say no but you must love me too  if i tell you you are handsome you must deny it and say i flatter you  but you must think your self more charming than i speak you  and like me for the beauty which i say you have as much as if i had it my self  if i ask you to kiss me you must be angry but you must not refuse me if i ask you for more you must be more angry  but more complying and as soon as ever i make you say you will cry out you must be sure to hold your tongue   miss prue o lord i swear this is pure  i like it better than

this motly livery only as the slave of love and menial creature of your beauty   ang mercy on me how he talks poor valentine   val nay faith now let us understand one another hypocrisy apart  the comedy draws toward an end and let us think of leaving acting and be our selves and since you have loved me you must own i have at length deserved you should confess it   ang sighs i would i had loved you  for heaven knows i pity you and could i have foreseen the bad effects i would have striven but that is too late  sighs val what sad effects  what is too late my seeming madness as deceived my father and procured me time to think of means to reconcile me to him and preserve the right of my inheritance to his estate which otherwise by articles i must this morning have resigned and this i had informed you of to day but you were gone before i knew you had been here   ang how i thought your love of me had caused this transport in your soul which it seems you only counterfeited for by mercenary ends and sordid interest   val nay now you do me wrong for if any interest was considered it was yours since i thought i wanted more than love to make me worthy of you   ang then you thought me mercenary  but how am i deluded by this interval of sense to reason with a madman   val oh it is barbarous to misunderstand me longer   enter jeremy ang oh here is a reasonable creature  sure he will not have the impudence to persevere  come jeremy acknowledge your trick and confess your masters madness counterfeit   jere counterfeit madam i will maintain him to be as absolutely and

move your mirth though not your compassion  exit jeremy ang i did not think you had apprehension enough to be exceptious but madmen show themselves most by overpretending to a sound understanding as drunken men do by overacting sobriety i was half inclining to believe you till i accidentally touched upon your tender part but now you have restored me to my former opinion and compassion   enter jeremy jere sir your father has sent to know if you are any better yet  will you please to be mad sir or how   val stupidity you know the penalty of all i am worth must pay for the confession of my

fool you take me for and you are mad and dont know it  exit ang and jenny val from a riddle you can expect nothing but a riddle there is my instruction and the moral of my lesson   reenter jeremy jere what is the lady gone again sir i hope you understood one another before she went   val understood she is harder to be understood than a piece of egyptian antiquity or an irish manuscript you may pore till you spoil your eyes and not improve your knowledge   jere i have heard em say sir they read hard hebrew books backwards may be you begin to read at the wrong end   val they say so of a witches prayer and dreams and dutch almanacks are to be understood by contraries but there is regularity and method in that she is a medal without a reverse or inscription for indifference has both sides alike yet while she does not seem to hate me i will pursue her and know her if it be possible in spite of the opinion of my satirical friend scandal who says  that women are like tricks by slight of hand which to admire we should not understand exeunt the end of the fourth act act v scene i a room in foresights house enter angelica and jenny ang where is sir sampson did you not tell me he would

honored with the commands of a fair lady a great while  odd madam you have revived me  not since i was five and thirty   ang why you have no great reason to complain sir sampson that is not long ago   sir samp zooks but it is madam a very great while to a man that admires a fine woman as much as i do   ang youre an absolute courtier sir sampson   sir samp not at all madam odsbud you wrong me i am not so old neither to be a bare courtier only a man of words odd i have warm blood about me yet and can serve a lady any way  come come let me tell you you women think a man old too soon faith and troth you do  come dont despise fifty odd fifty in a hale constitution is no such contemptible age   ang fifty a contemptible age not at all a very fashionable age i think  i assure you i know very considerable beaus that set a good face upon fifty fifty i have seen fifty in a sidebox by candlelight outblossom five and twenty   sir samp o pox outsides outsides a pize take em mere outsides hang your sidebox beaus no i am none of those none of your forced trees that pretend to blossom in the fall and bud when they should bring forth fruit i am of a long lived race and inherit vigor none of my family married till fifty yet they begot sons and daughters till fourscorce i am of your patriarchs i a branch of one of your antideluvian families fellows that the flood could not wash away well madam what are your commands has any young rogue affronted you and shall i cut his throat or    ang no sir sampson i have no quarrel upon my hands  i have more occasion for your conduct than your courage at this time to tell you the truth i am weary of living single and want a husband   sir samp odsbud and it is pity you should  odd would she would like me then i should hamper my young rogues odd would she would faith and troth she is devilish handsome aside madam you deserve a good husband and twere a pity you should be thrown away upon any of these young idle rogues about the town odd there is never a young fellow worth hanging  that is a very young fellow  pize on em they never think beforehand of any thing  and if they commit matrimony it is as they commit murder out of a frolic and are ready to hang themselves or to be hanged by the law the next morning  odso have a care madam   ang therefore i ask your advice sir sampson i have fortune enough to make any man easy that i can like if there were such a thing as a young agreeable man with a reasonable stock of good nature and sense  for i would neither have an absolute wit nor a fool   sir samp odd you are hard to please madam to find a young fellow that is neither a wit in his own eye nor a fool in the eye of the world is a very hard task but faith and troth you speak very discreetly for i hate both a wit and a fool   ang she that marries a fool sir sampson commits the reputation of her honesty or understanding to the censure of the world and she that marries a very witty man submits both to the severity and insolent conduct of her husband i should like a man of wit for a lover because i would have such an one in my power but i would no more be his wife than his enemy for his malice is not a more terrible consequence of his aversion than his jealousy is of his love   sir samp none of old foresights sybills ever uttered such a truth odsbud you have won my heart i hate a wit i had a son that was spoiled among em a good hopeful lad till he learned to be a wit  and might have risen in the state  but a pox on it his wit run him out of his money and now his poverty has run him out of his wits   ang sir sampson as your friend i must tell you you are very much abused in that matter he is no more mad than you are   sir samp how madam would i could prove it   ang i can tell you how that may be done  but it is a thing that would make me appear to be too much concerned in your affairs   sir samp odsbud i believe she likes me  aside  ah madam all my affairs are scarce worthy to be laid at your feet and i wish madam they stood in a better posture that i might make a more becoming offer to a lady of your incomparable beauty and merit  if i had peru in one hand and mexico in the other and the eastern empire under my feet it would make me only a more glorious victim to be offered at the shrine of your beauty   ang bless me sir sampson what is the matter   sir samp odd madam i love you  and if you would take my advice in a husband    ang hold hold sir sampson i asked your advice for a husband and you are giving me your consent  i was indeed thinking to propose something like it in jest to satisfy you about valentine for if a match were seemingly carried on between you and me it would oblige him to throw off his disguise of madness in apprehension of losing me for you know he has long pretended a passion for me   sir samp gadzooks a most ingenious contrivance  if we were to go throw with it but why must the match only be seemingly carried on  odd let it be a real contract   ang o fie sir sampson what would the world say   sir samp say they would say you were a wise woman and i a happy man odd madam i will love you as long as i live and leave you a good jointure when i die   ang ay but that is not in your power sir sampson for when valentine confesses himself in his senses he must make over his inheritance to his younger brother   sir samp odd youre cunning a wary baggage faith and troth i like you the better  but i warrant you i have a proviso in the obligation in favor of my self  body of me i have a trick to turn the settlement upon the issue male of our two bodies begotten odsbud let us find children and i will find an estate   ang will you well do you find the estate and leave the the other to me    sir samp o rogue but i will trust you and will you consent is it a match then   ang let me consult my lawyer concerning this obligation and if i find what you propose practicable i will give you my answer   sir samp with all my heart  come in with me and i will lend you the bond  you shall consult your lawyer and i will consult a parson odzooks i am a young man odzooks i am a young man and i will make it appear  odd youre devilish handsome faith and troth youre very handsome and i am very young and very lusty  odsbud hussy you know how to choose and so do i  odd i think we are very well met  give me your hand odd let me kiss it it is as warm and as soft  as what  odd as the other hand  give me the other hand and i will mumble em and kiss em till they melt in my mouth   ang hold sir sampson  youre profuse of your vigor before your time you will spend your estate before you come to it   sir samp no no only give you a rentroll of my possessions  ah baggage  i warrant you for little sampson odd sampsons a very good name for an able fellow your sampsons were strong dogs from the beginning   ang have a care and dont overact your part  if you remember the strongest sampson of your name pulled an old house over his head at last   sir samp say

and make your best on it   scan the music stays for you  dance scan well madam you have done exemplary justice in punishing an inhuman father and rewarding a faithful lover but there is a third good work which i in particular must thank you for i was an infidel to your sex and you have converted me  for now i am convinced that all women are not like fortune blind in bestowing favors either to those who do not merit or who do not want em   ang it is an unreasonable accusation that you lay upon our sex you tax us with injustice only to cover your own want of merit you would all have the reward of love but few have the cstancy to stay till it becomes your due men are generally hypocrites and infidels they pretend to worship but have neither zeal nor faith how few like valentine would perserve even unto martyrdom and sacrifice their interest to their constancy in admiing me you misplace the novelty  the miracle to day is that we find a lover true not that a womans kind exeunt omnes finis
