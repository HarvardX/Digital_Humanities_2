love in the east or adventures of twelve hours a comic opera in three acts  written by the author of the strangers at home  as performed at the theater royal drury lane  london printed for w lowndes no    fleet street mdcclxxxviii price  s  d  the reader is requested to observe that the passages omitted in the representation at the theater are here preserved and distinguished by inverted commas as from line    to line    in page    to thomas linley esquire dear sir it may appear singular that because i can flatter myself with being numbered among your friends i should for that very reason dedicate this opera to you without asking your permission but it is my knowledge of your diffidence that has prevented that solicitation  as i should however fear to forfeit my claim to your friendship by giving you in public that praise which you shun in private i must content myself with the hope that you will consider this as an attempt to prove the esteem and regard with which  i am dear sir your most obedient and faithful humble servant j c e j h  th march      it is so usual for the author of a dramatic piece on its publication to thank the performers that on some occasions a writer might be led to withhold his acknowledgments left truth should be considered as mere customary compliment  the author of the following opera is not however subjected to that risque when he acquits himself of a duty by giving the performers a tribute of praise the justice of which is attested by the voice of the public  dramatis personae mushroom mr king warnford mr kelly colonel baton

miss collett love in the east a comic opera act i scene i the landingplace at calcutta a number of people indians and europeans walking on the shore  several sailors come to the front of the stage as if just arrived and sing a chorus chorus hail to indias happy shore where nature from her choicest store her blessings gives with bounteous hand and decks with smiles her favorite land our dreams of danger now are over hail to indias happy shore  duetto no more the hidden rocks we fear no more the whistling winds we hear which threaten devastation wide as ocean rolls his troubled tide da capo chorus captain coromandel comes forward with stanmore stan captain coromandel  once more welcome to bengal   coro ah my old friend stanmore i expected to have seen you in england before now  well sir what news in bengal  how is your old friend and patron colonel bentley as whimsical as ever   stan as well beloved in the settlement as ever i promise you the colonels singularities do not cloud his virtues  while others court esteem he commands it  you know he has long fought under the banner of plain dealing   coro oh that is a service in which there is but bad pay  he will not be able to enlist many recruits   stan but then the honor   coro why as you say if he loves the honor of fighting he will have enough  for with plain dealing he will be sure to find enemies in plenty every where  and how is the charming young lady whom the colonel has taken under his patronage   stan ormellina you mean  she is a charming creature indeed  but still unmarried   coro i suppose she will not remain so long the colonel has no doubt taught her to be obedient in order to train her up for a wife   stan a wife no no sir the colonel is too much a man of honor to think of uniting threescore and eighteen   coro but what has honor to do in the business my dear stanmore   stan not much indeed  i think an unfortunate young woman has far less reason to complain of the poor fellow who takes her purse on the highway than of the old dotard who robs her of her happiness under the title of marriage and yet the same laws which encourage her to hang the one command her to honor and obey the other   coro you seem to speak feelingly   stan i have but too much cause  the woman i loved was thus sacrificed   coro pshaw man dont droop because you are separated from your mistress she will love you the better when you meet without a storm now and then we should not enjoy fair weather   air i stanmore ah when safe at home arrived at last where often the maid you love has heard the secret sigh she fondly hears your tale of dangers past how sweet to kiss the tear from beautys eye with this reward in view what manly bosom fears to brave the various war which skies and waters wage the winds the thunders roar unmoved he hears while future calms of love his hopes engage ii beauty then shall bend at mirths gay shrine shall hail the festive hour and mock her fond alarms your bumper as she fills the nectard wine becomes the happy mirror of her charms with this reward in view etc  coro here comes a passenger of mine a tailor with whom i must bring you acquainted i think the fellow will entertain you  enter twist mr stanmore this is tom twist  a very whimlical fellow who not being satisfied with sitting crosslegged in london is resolved to cut out work for himself in bengal   stan i am his most obedient  and pray mr twist what business do you mean to follow in bengal   twist the same business which every one else follows in bengal getting money oh captain   stan but in what line  for there are various ways of carrying on that business   twist yes sir and some of them d  d strange ways they tell us in england   stan and pray mr twist on what do you mean to depend in becoming a favorite of fortune   twist accomplishments sir  i can dance a cotillion tolerably sing twenty songs about jockies and jennies for the ladies and play malbrouk on the fiddle  in short i can do every thing but write and read and my genius never could stoop to that   coro but tell me how did you acquire these elegant accomplishments   twist you know sir i always moved in a genteel circle  my master worked for none but people of quality not a tradesman in westminster could boast of a greater number of book debts   stan that must have been a vast happiness   twist yes old staytape ruined himself by his great connections  he visited some of the first people   coro what a tailor visit the first people   twist aye sir  two or three times a day sometimes but he was seldom fortunate enough to meet with them at home they weretoo much engaged in paying off the debts of the nation to attend to their own   coro well twist a truce with your wit for the present i have promised my friend mushroom to send you to him  he wishes to have some clothes made up in a hurry and if your needle goes but as fast as your tongue i shall gain credit by recommending you   stan mr twist i heartily wish you success  we are all three brother adventurers and however different our situations our object is the same   trio and chorus twist coromandel and stanmore we be three who doomed to roam have dared the dangerous seas that land becomes our dearest home which gives us wealth and ease no other climes will we explore nor search the world around our choice is fixed on indias shore our home shall be this

he omits to tell me what has occasioned you to quit england in this disguise   eliza ah my dear ormellina what being is that in the creation for whom woman feels a thousand various emotions who is her blessing and her torment her tyrant and her slave the man she loves  in short i am come to bengal in search of a husband no uncommon errand i believe   orm but your story   eliz is told in a few words the prayers and entreaties of an indigent mother forced me to marry where i could not love the object of my affections quitted the kingdom in despair and took passage for bengal  my auld robin gray is

is my friend  ensign stanmore but tell me what is this history of me which you say you have heard   eliz that you are an orphan  educated by colonel bentley as his daughter   orm well   eliz that your lovers name is warnford  that you are jealous of him with a woman of intrigue  a mrs mushroom   orm who could have told you this   eliz all that relates to you and mr warnford i learned from mrs mushroom herself i called at her house just now with a letter of introduction from captain coromandel  you seem surprised at my knowledge but i should think very meanly of myself indeed were i to be

to tell you my name   orm your name   eliz you must know that in order to conceal myself from my lover the more effectually i have assumed this disguise and am at present alexander mproteus at your service   orm and why disguise yourself from my poor friend stanmore   eliz only till i have perplexed him a little  coquetry with a lover is like playing with your lapdog or kitten the fonder you are of the pretty animal the more delight you feel in teazing it come come my dear friend i shall make you a convert to my laughing philosophy   orm i wish indeed you could   eliz depend upon it i shall none can pay more sincere homage to cupid than we laughing lovers you sighing folks make him an eastern despot and fall prostrate before him with us he is an european prince  we bow and simper at his levee you degrade him to the mere tyrant of slaves we exalt him to a glorious situation  the monarch of happy subjects   scene mushrooms house mr and mrs mushroom mush mrs mushroom   mrs mush well mr mushroom   mush do you dine at home today   mrs mush perhaps not   mush you are not resolved then   mrs mush no  yes  no  i will not dine at home   mush i am very glad of it   mrs mush i shall leave you to expose yourself as much as you please today and not take the trouble of interpreting your nonsense to your company to persuade them you are not a fool   mush they will never believe me to be otherwise than a fool whilst they remember i married such a precious wife   mrs mush well sir and is it not that precious wife who has introduced you to most of the company you keep in bengal   mush yes my dear you have indeed introduced me to all the rakehelly young dogs in the three provinces they stick so close to you that whenever you go out you move like the queen be with a whole swarm after you   mrs mush you dont mean to insinuate that i have wronged your bed mr mushroom   mush not i my love  i would not insinuate that till i have proof of it and i am afraid you will take care to keep that out of my reach   mrs mush very well sir very well but indeed what had i else to expect when i married an illiterate sordid wretch and twenty years older than myself into the bargain   mush aye that is an unpardonable crime in me i never knew a woman leave age out of the list of a mans faults what an ass was i to marry a broken milliner from bondstreet who brought out a face as badly patched up as her reputation for a venture to bengal besides which she had not stock in trade enough to fill one of her own bandboxes   mrs mush a very fit match mr mushroom for an ignorant runaway shopboy with a mind as destitute of ideas as his pockets were of money  the whole settlement knows your origin   mush yes i always meant they should know it i glory in it that there was a time when martin mushroom one of the richest men in bengal had not halfacrown in his pocket nor a whole coat to his back  zounds    mrs mush dont fly in a passion now   mush not i egad that we hate each other most heartily you very well know   mrs mush and the worst part of the story is that we must not own it before company   mush no  that is a cursed confinement upon us   mrs mush well it cannot be helped mr mushroom as we are tied together we must make the best of a bad bargain hush here is somebody coming   enter servant serve mr mproteus   mush show him up  draw your chair closer  enter eliza as mproteus my dear mproteus   eliz ah blessing of you are hearts  you are a pattern for a married folk   mrs mush aside yes and a pattern that is pretty much in vogue i believe  we have been talking over some old stories havnt we my dear mr mushroom   mush yes my life we always talk them over when we are alone aside i shall not be able to keep my temper much longer  well my dear i must leave you for an hour or two if coromandel should send the tailor let them set him to work to alter my blue and gold and if colonel baton should call pray entertain him till i return   mrs mush oh that is the french officer you expect from pondicherri   mush the same my dear he never was in calcutta before he is a man of gallantry mr mproteus  a dangerous man among the ladies   mrs mush then i am resolved to make a conquest of him aside  how do i look today my dear   mush much better than you did  aside before you were painted   mrs mush ha ha ha mr mproteus the only looking glass an old married woman has to consult is her husband   eliz you are reight madam  like a looking glass he will let ye see aw you are fauts   mrs mush well if you must go good bye love leaning on mushrooms shoulder   mush kissing his hand adieu my angel you see sir what it is to have a wife so d  d fond of one  exit mrs mush at length we are alone oh mr mproteus what an acquisition it is to have a friend like you  the moment i saw you i discovered that we had kindred minds   eliz i houp madam they wunna gree the war for being relations   mrs mush you will recollect i mentioned to you my fears that mr warnford might misunderstand my behavior to him   eliz i remember it perfectly madam i never forget my friends   mrs mush indeed well that is very disinterested to remember your friends while you forget yourself and that you certainly do at this moment  what is become of that charming caledonian accent which graced your conversation you are reight madam like a looking glass he will let ye see aw you are fauts mimicking ha ha ha   eliz i cry for quarter my dear madam a slip of the tongue has betrayed me to be sure the truth is love induced me to assume this disguise which i must wear for two or three days you shall then know who and what i am come madam you need not fear to make me your confidant i am too much in your power for you to apprehend i should deceive you   mrs mush aside there is some reason in that  well mproteus i will convince you that i can be generous   eliz then madam to the subject of our conversation  mr warnford   mrs mush well as i told you  i have chatted laughed rallied him and have given into a thousand little levities in which we innocent women indulge without meaning any thing   eliz certainly  why what can you do if a smart fellow will attack you with a curse me madam but you are a monstrous fine woman you would not be so ill bred as to blush look foolish and threaten to tell your husband   mrs mush that would be ill breeding indeed   eliz to be sure lud why a declaration of love excites a woman to coquetry as naturally as the sound of a fiddle excites her to dance never mind my dear madam scandal is a tax on pleasure and if the commodity cannot be smuggled a woman of spirit will rather pay the duty than go without it   mrs mush but is it not very hard that scandal should attack us women of spirit who instead of shrinking from temptation boldly meet him put him to the rout and show the rest of our sex the way to victory and glory my maxim mr mproteus is that virtue should be tried   eliz therefore i presume madam you have tried yours   mrs mush aye sir i thank my stars often and often  do you know    eliz ah madam what a treasure do you possess in such a veteran virtue  you must have great confidence in it   mrs mush prodigious  i will give you a proof of it  i mean to give warnford a private meeting and in my own room too ha ha you seem surprised but you dont consider that so bold a proposal will argue such a confidence in my own prudence that it must entirely destroy all his hopes of success   eliz no really i did not think of that   mrs mush you have it in your power to witness the purity of my motives in case my conduct should be misconstrued but i have written a letter to warnford which i will show you giving eliza a letter   enter lucy who whispers mrs mushroom and exit eliz this will be bad intelligence for my poor friend ormellina but to the letter reading i am extremely anxious to remove any prejudice you may have formed to my disadvantage as i think that can be best done by a private interview let me see you as soon as possible  three raps at my chamber door will be your passport to the explanation proposed by maria mushroom   mrs mush one of warnfords servants happens fortunately to be in the house  it will be much better to send it by him than by one of my own people takes the letter and seals it  enter rosario how do you do rosario you must deliver a letter from this gentleman to your master   rosa yes missee aside dear always be some cus mischief ven missee be so civil   eliz aside to mrs mush you have not directed the letter   mrs mush aside to eliz it would not be prudent for my handwriting to appear on the direction  besides rosario supposes the letter yours   eliz shall i address it then   mrs mush oh no that will appear so strange to warnford  there is no necessity for any direction  there rosario  there is the letter turning to eliz i hope this will set my character in a proper point of view it is really very troublesome for people to fall in love with one in this
