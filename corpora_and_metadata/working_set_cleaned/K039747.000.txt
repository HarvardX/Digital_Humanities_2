furentes uncta ratis metuit procellas farther thoughts on tarwater as the many experiments that are daily made of the virtues of tarwater furnish new discoveries and reflections some of these i have thrown together and offer to the public in hopes they may prove useful  it is a frequent complaint that tarwater is made of bad tar being of a reddish color sweetish or disagreeably insipid but though the dregs of tar are often foul and make foul tarwater and though tar already used is often made use of by unfair dealers a second if not a third time which produces a vile potion void of the genuine flavor and virtue of tarwater yet i apprehend these defects may sometimes be ascribed rather to the vessel wherein the tarwater is made than to the tar itself  tarwater being made in an earthen vessel unglazed or that has lost part of its glazing may extract as it is a strong menstruum from the clay a fade sweetishness offensive to the palate it should seem therefore that the best way of making tarwater is in a stone jug or earthen vessel throughout well glazed and as it will not fail to extract a tincture from any metallic vessel it should be warmed in a well glazed pipkin rather than a saucepan  by increasing the proportion of tar to the water and by stirring it longer tarwater may be made strong enough for a spoonful to impregnate a large glass a thing very useful on a road  those who in chronical disorders or as a preservative have for a long time drunk tarwater must in acute cases drink the more  tarwater must be drunk warm in agues smallpox measles and fevers in colics and disorders of the bowels in gout also and rheumatism in most other ailments cold or warm at the choice of the patient  in fevers the patient cannot begin too soon or drink too much by undoubted experience it is found to cool the hot and warm the cold and to be a most successful medicine in fevers notwithstanding its great virtue in palsies and dropsies  when not long since an inflammation attacked the throat breast and lungs of children and became general in my neighborhood numbers were recovered by the use of tarwater nor did i hear that any miscarried who used it though many perished who did not  nor is it a medicine less proper and efficacious in old age at the same time that this inflammatory distemper raged among the children a woman in her sixtyeighth year from violent cold was seized at once with ague colic and jaundice of all which maladies she was cured in a fortnight by drinking three pints of warm tarwater every day numberless such instances daily occur which show it to be a safe and efficacious medicine both for old and young  evacuations by sweat which usually render patients very weak and dispirited have not the same bad effects when produced by tarwater which i have frequently known to give high spirits in all the stages of a fever and under the lowest regimen therefore old people and weak persons who cannot well bear common evacuations are best cured by tarwater which in some sort seems to renew those who are worn out with age and infirmities  tarwater is of singular use in strengthening the stomach and bowels and agrees particularly well with infants taken either by themselves or by the nurse and best by both though as it throws the ill humors out into the surface of the skin it may render them for a time perhaps unseemly with eruptions but withal healthy and lively and i will venture to say that it lays in them the principles of a good constitution for the rest of their lives  nor is it only useful to the bodies of infants it has also a good effect on their minds as those who drink it are observed to be remarkably forward and sprightly even the most heavy lumpish and unpromising infants appear to be much improved by it a child there is in my neighborhood of fine parts who at first seemed stupid and an idiot but by constant use of tarwater grew lively and observing and is now noted for understanding beyond others of the same age  infants are easily brought to take it by spoon and even grow to a liking of it and as their disorders arise chiefly from indigestion they receive the greatest benefit from a medicine so well calculated to strengthen the intestines and preserve them from fits in a word if it were the common practice to accustom infants from the beginning to take tarwater this would greatly conduce to the health both of their minds and bodies there is i am verily persuaded no one thing in the power of art or nature that would so generally and effectually contribute to repair the constitutions of our gentry and nobility by strengthening the children and casting off in their infancy those impurities and taints which they often bring into the world  an infant may take one quarter of a pint in the day warm by spoonfuls less may do good and there is no fear of excess when i consider the private woe of families as well as the public loss occasioned by the death of such an incredible number of infants under two years of age i cannot but insist on recommending tarwater both as a remedy and preservative in that tender age which cannot bear the common treatment and methods of physic or with safety take those drugs which are fitter for grown persons  another reason which recommends tarwater particularly to infants and children is the great security it brings against the smallpox to those that drink it who are observed either never to take that distemper or to have it in the gentlest manner  there is no distemper more contagious and destructive than the smallpox or more generally dreaded attended with worse symptoms or that leaves behind it worse effects i observe at the same time that tarwater is in no other case a more safe and sure remedy than in this of which captain drapes certificate sworn to before the mayor of liverpool in the presence of several principal persons of that town is a most evident proof  that one hundred and seventy persons seized at once with the smallpox deprived of all conveniences and in the worst circumstances of a narrow ship and hot climate should all recover by the single medicine of tarwater except one who would not drink it is a matter of fact so plain and convincing and so well attested as to leave no doubt in minds free from prepossession about the usefulness and efficacy of tarwater in the smallpox a point i had been before sufficiently convinced of by many instances in my own neighborhood  it has been surmised by some celebrated physicians that one day a specific may be discovered for the peculiar venom of the smallpox there seems to be some reason for thinking that tarwater is such a specific i say this on good grounds having by many experiments observed its virtue in curing as well as in preventing that cruel distemper during the whole course of which it is to be drank warm a moderate glass about half a pint every hour in common cases may suffice in bad cases more may be given there is no fear of excess  those who endeavor to discredit this cooling cordial and salutary medicine as an inflamer of the blood do very consistently decry its use in the smallpox but there can be nothing more clear full and satisfactory than captain drapes affidavit to convince reasonable people of the great and surprising efficacy of tarwater in the cure of the smallpox and consequently of the groundlesness of that report which ascribes a heating or inflaming quality to it and yet that groundless report has hindered many from reaping the benefit they might otherwise have done from the use of this water which is of excellent virtue in all kinds of inflammatory disorders fevers quinsies pleurisies and such like of the hot and inflamed kind whereof the public as well as myself have known a multitude of examples  i ask whether the fact sworn before the magistrates of liverpool be not a sufficient answer to all that is objected from an inflaming quality to tarwater can any instance be produced in the whole materia medica or history of physic of the virtue of a medicine tried on greater numbers or under greater disadvantages or with greater success or more credibly attested i wish for the common good of mankind that the same experiment was tried in our hospitals probably the world would soon be relieved from that great and general terror of the smallpox  when i hear of the devastations made by this distemper in great cities and populous towns how many lives are lost or as may be said thrown away which might have been in all likelihood easily preserved by the use of a medicine so cheap and obvious and in eyery ones power it seems matter of great concern and astonishment and leaves one at a loss to guess at the motives that govern human actions in affairs of the greatest moment the experiment may be easily made if an equal number of poor patients in the smallpox were put into two hospitals at the same time of the year and provided with the same necessaries of diet and lodging and for further care let the one have a tub of tarwater and an old woman the other hospital what attendance and drugs you please  in all obstinate sores and ulcers i very much recommend the drinking of tarwater and washing them with a strong lotion of it will hasten the cure  one of the most painful and dangerous cases is that of a womans fore breast how many poor creatures after long languishing in misery are obliged to suffer the most severe chirurgical operations often the cutting off the entire breast the use of tarwater in those cases has been attended with such success that i do earnestly recommend the drinking thereof both as a cure and preservative as a most effectual medicine to remove the shooting pains that precede a cancer and also to cure the cancer itself without amputation cancerous and sore breasts are such cruel cases occasioned by so many internal causes as well as outward accidents that it is a necessary piece of humanity to contribute all we can to the prevention and cure thereof  in the kings evil leprosy and foulest cases tarwater cannot be too much recommended the poor vagabonds of ireland are many of them infected and eaten up with the foul disease which with them passes for a canker as they call it several instances of extraordinary cures have been performed on such persons by drinking tarwater copiously for some weeks or months together without confinement or other restraint than that of a regular cool diet it is indeed a specific both for this and all other taints and impurities of the blood  an extract of siris was made and accounts of the effects of tarwater were reprinted in america in which continent as well as in the islands much use has been made thereof particularly by those who possess great numbers of slaves of this i have been informed by letters and by word of mouth from persons belonging to those parts who have assured me of the extensive and successful use of this medicine in many cases and more especially in the most inveterate kinds of the soul disease  i need not say how dearly they purchase health who obtain it by salivation and yet long and severe as that course is it is often unsuccessful there are instances of such as having passed through it with much misery and patience have been afterward cured by the simple use of tarwater  the kings evil so lothsom in its symptoms and effects and withal so difficult if at all possible to cure by any other method is most surely and easily cured by the tarwater even when the patient is far gone even when he derives it from his ancestors a quart per diem for a few months i have known to cure the most deplorable and abandoned cases  how many wealthy families otherwise at their ease are corrupted with this taint in their blood how many want heirs and husbands through this odious malady a specific for this disease alone would be justly esteemed a most valuable secret and the plenty and cheapness of the medicine ought not in reason to make it less esteemed  salivating bleeding and purging are attended with great hardships and inconveniences even where the patient recovers reducing the strength and spirits of those who use them whereas tarwater greatly adds to both  in fractures and wounds a quart or two drank daily while the patient is under cure does very much assuage the pain and promote his recovery both as by its balsamic nature it disposes the parts to heal and also as it lessens if not totally prevents the fever  a poor boy in cloyne having fallen from a tree broke both arm and wrist this accident was concealed or neglected for two or three weeks he was then put under the care of a skilful bonesetter who finding the bones knit and grown crooked and that it would be necessary to break them again in order to set them right and withal considering the hot season of the year in july he apprehended his patients being thrown into a fever that might prove fatal but the boy being made to drink copiously of tarwater this prevented or lessened the fever in such sort that the bones were broke and set again and the cure proceeded as easily and speedily as could be wished  i have known several instances of bruises and wounds cured by tarwater a person in my neighborhood ran over by a horse was much bruised and cured only by drinking tarwater another knocked down with a mallet thereupon thrown into a violent fever and given for dead another wounded with an axe so that his life was thought in danger were both recovered by the use of tarwater which as it is sovereign against gangrenes and fevers has great success in all sorts of wounds contusions and fractures being taken throughout the whole chirurgical process along with whatsoever other methods or remedies are applied  tarwater operates variously in dropsies and bruises it has been known to work by purging the stronger kind being used as a wash is good against ulcerous eruptions but in all cases where the lotion is used i believe the drinking of tarwater might alone suffice albeit the sores may be longer withering and drying away  there is a certain age or time of life when the female sex runs no small risk from the ceasing of their natural evacuations in this case tarwater is a good preservative purifying the blood and clearing it from that cancerous tendency which it is sometimes subject to about that time i take it to be a specific in all cancerous cases even the bleeding cancer esteemed incurable by physicians has been cured by tarwater  in diseases peculiar to women it is of no small use several who had suffered much by accidents in childbearing have found themselves relieved by tarwater in all sorts of tumors wens and praeternatural excrescences it has been found an excellent remedy  many dangerous symptoms and even sudden death are often owing to a polypus in some or other of the vessels through which the blood circulates than which it seems there is no inward cause of death or disease more to be dreaded and guarded against how many drop down dead in our streets or at table or in the midst of business or diversions how many are found dead in their beds  tremors palpitations of the heart irregular pulses apoplexies sudden deaths often proceed from a slow stagnating interrupted motion or stoppage of the blood in its circulation through the body and there seems to be no cause so certainly productive of obstructed circulation as the polypus a case perhaps much more frequent than is commonly imagined morgagni the celebrated professor at padua and most eminent anatomist who was supposed to have dissected more human bodies than any man living assured me above thirty years ago that in the far greater part of such bodies he found polypuses if not in the ventricles of the heart or larger vessels yet in some other vessel or cavity to which he attributes many disorders and which he supposed to be formed by the obstructed motion of the blood to prevent this he dissuaded from all tight ligatures especially in sleep unbuttoning the neck and wristbands of his shirt every night a practice he had learned as he said from his master the famous malpighi  when the circulation is once quite stopped nothing can restore it which would be the same thing as restoring a dead man to life and in proportion as the circulation of the blood is obstructed the body is disordered total obstruction is death partial obstruction is disease the polypus therefore is always hurtful if not mortal it is indeed matter of serious reflection that we may probably carry about with us a principle of death always at work within and of a nature so violent and sudden in its effects so hard to come at and so difficult to subdue  it may well be thought at first view a vain undertaking to attempt to dissolve a fleshy or membranous substance so latent and inaccessible by common means or medicines but as tarwater has been undoubtedly known to dissolve and disperse wens and other fleshy or membranous tumors in the outward parts of the body see the effects of tar water sect     and      having been drank and circulated with the blood it should seem by a parity of reason that it may also dissolve and put an end to those concretions that are formed in the ventricles of the heart or blood vessels and so remove one great cause of apoplexies and sudden death and what cures may prevent i have been the longer on this subject for the sake of many who lead sickly lives as well as several who are snatched away by untimely death  universally in all cases where other methods fail i could wish this of tarwater was tried it has been sometimes known that the most inveterate headaches and other nervous disorders that would yield to no other medicine have been cured by a course of tarwater regularly and constantly pursued  wheresoever pure blood or plenty of spirits are wanting it may be concluded from manifold experience that tarwater is of singular benefit several persons have acknowledged themselves to be much fitter to go through business or study from the use of it  nor is it only medicinal to human kind it is also of no small use in the curing of brute animals it has been tried on several kinds particularly with great success in the late epidemical distemper of our horses and i have been credibly informed that being drank in plenty it has recovered even a glandered horse that was thought incurable  and as it is of such extensive use both to man and beast it should seem that a tub of tarwater constantly supplied in a market town would serve in some sort for an hospital many other drugs are not easily got this is every where plenty and cheap many are of a doubtful nature this of known innocence others soon perish this lasts for years and is not the worse for keeping this in short is a medicine for the common people being a safe and cheap remedy for such as cannot afford to be long sick or to make use of costly medicines  a patient who drinks tarwater must not be alarmed at pustules or eruptions in the skin these are good symptoms and show the impurities of the blood to be cast out it is also not amiss to observe that as tarwater by its active qualities does stir the humors entering the minutest capillaries and dislodging obstructions it may happen that this working shall sometimes be felt in the limbs or discharge itself in a fit of the gout which however disagreeable proves salutary  i am credibly informed of several strange conveyances which tarwater has found out whereby to discharge impurities from the human constitution a person who had been in a bad state of health above twenty years upon a course of tarwater was thrown into a most extraordinary fit of an ague and from that time recovered a good state of health an old gentleman in the county of cork who for a long time had been a valetudinarian afflicted with many infirmities being advised to drink tarwater found himself relieved but it produced and soon cured a pthiriasis or lousy distemper in which the putrid humors having discharged themselves left him quite sound and healthy  in a course of tarwater if any disorder happens from some other cause as from cold from the use of strong liquors from a surfeit or such like accident it would not be fair to impute it to tarwater and yet this has been sometimes done  the effects of vomiting occasioned by tarwater are not to be apprehended some are discouraged from drinking because their stomachs cannot bear it but when it takes a turn toward working upwards nature by that very way has been often known to carry on the cure a worthy gentleman member of parliament came into my neighborhood in the autumn of the year    0 he was cachectic and extremely reduced so that his friends thought him near his end upon his entering into a course of tarwater it produced a prodigious vomiting which weakened him much for the present but persisting to continue the use thereof for about two months he was restored to his health strength and spirits  tarwater is very diuretic thereby preventing stone and gravel and carrying off by urine those salts that might otherwise occasion fevers rheumatisms dropsies headaches and many other disorders if retained in the blood hence some have apprehended a diabetes from the continued use thereof but it is so far from causing a diabetes that it has been known to cure that disorder  the constitution of a patient sometimes requires during a course of tarwater that he take water and honey also roasted apples stewed prunes and other diet of an opening kind a hint of this is sufficient if the reader now and then meets with some remarks contained in my former writings on this subject he may be pleased to consider i had rather repeat than forget what i think useful to be known  some endeavoring to discourage the use of tarwater in england have given out that it may indeed be serviceable in ireland where people live on such low diet as sour milk and potatoes but it cannot be of the same service in england where men are accustomed to a more liberal and hearty food and indeed it must be owned that the peasants in this island live but poorly but no people in europe live better in the sense of eating and drinking than our gentry and citizens and from these the instances of cures by tarwater have been chiefly taken those who would confine its use to the moist air and poor diet of ireland may be assured that all over europe in france and germany italy portugal and holland tarwater works the same effect in both north and south in west and east indies it has been used and continues to be used with great success it has reached all our colonies both on the continent and the islands and many barrels of tarwater have been sent from amsterdam to batavia of all which i have had authentic accounts but its use is no where more conspicuous than at sea in curing that plague of seafaring persons the scurvy as was found in the late attempt to discover a northwest passage and as i doubt not will be found as often as it is tried every ship in his majestys navy should always have a vessel of tarwater upon deck for the use of the sailors both in the scurvy and other maladies  it is indeed a medicine equally calculated for all climates for sea and land for rich and poor high and low livers being as has been elsewhere mentioned a cordial which does not heat a peculiar privilege this and of excellent use that it is a cordial is manifest from its cheering and enlivening quality and that it is not heating is as manifest from its singular use in all cases where the blood is inflamed as this medicine imparts a genial friendly warmth suited to the human constitution those who pass through a course of tarwater would do well not to increase such friendly warmth to an inflaming heat by a wrong regimen of highseasoned food and strong liquors which are not wanted by the drinkers of tarwater there is a certain degree of heat necessary to the wellbeing and life of man more than this will be uneasy and this uneasiness indicates a proper choice of diet  i have myself drank above a gallon of tarwater in a few hours and been cooled and recovered from a fever by it so many instances of the same nature i have known as would make it evident to any unprejudiced person that tarwater is a cooling medicine of which truth i am as thoroughly convinced as it is possible to be of any theorem in physic or natural science  the unsuccessfulness of other methods should rather be an encouragement than a bar to the trial of tarwater a young lady daughter to a worthy gentleman near cork had been long afflicted with a grievous pain in her side and having had the best advice that could be got was not relieved until she drank tarwater which quite removed her pain some time after she was again seized with the same disorder but returning to the use of tarwater she grew well and still continues so  a woman turned out of the infirmary at cork as incurable because she would not submit to the cutting off her leg came to cloyne where she continued half a year drinking tarwater and living upon bread and milk by which course she recovered and went to service  there is at present while i am writing a most remarkable case here at cloyne of a poor soldier in a dropsy whose belly was swollen to a most immoderate size he said he had been five months in an hospital at dublin and having tried other methods in vain left it to avoid being tapped it is a fortnight since he came to cloyne during which time he has drunk two quarts of tarwater every day his belly is now quite reduced his appetite and sleep which were gone are restored he gathers strength every moment and he who was despaired of seems to be quite out of danger both to himself and to all who see him it is remarkable that upon drinking the tarwater he voided several worms of a very extraordinary size this medicine which is observed to make some persons costive is to hydropic patients a strong purge the present is but one of several instances wherein the dropsy has been cured by tarwater which i never knew to fail in any species of that malady  i am very credibly informed that an aged clergyman of maidstone in kent being reduced to the last extremity by the gout in his stomach after having tried strong liquors and the methods usual in that case without success betook himself to drink a vast quantity of warm tarwater still replenishing and letting it take its course by which it pleased god to deliver him from the jaws of death  a gentleman in the county of clare near ennis had a fever and pleurisy and inflammation of the lungs being at the last extremity and given over by two physicians he was advised to drink tarwater which he did eight quarts next morning one of the doctors asking at what hour his patient died to his great surprise found he was recovered this i had from a parliament man his neighbor  when the yellow fever as it was called raged in the west indies the negroes with a tub of tarwater in their quarters did well but some of the better sort miscarried among whom the physician himself lay at the point of death but his brother recovered him by pouring down his throat in spoonfuls some of the same liquor that recovered the negroes the fact was related to me by a gentleman who was then in the island of st christophers and knew it to be true  a physician himself not long since assured me he had cured an ulcer in the bladder by ordering his patient to drink tarwater when he had tried all other methods in vain and thought the case incurable  but it would be endless to relate the effects of tarwater in desperate cases the recovery of mrs wilson daughter to the late bishop of london from a lingering hopeless disorder was a noted case and attested to by his lordship i have even been informed upon good authority of two or three instances wherein persons have been recovered by tarwater after they had rattles in the throat  in certain cases a smaller quantity of tarwater has proved ineffectual when a larger has perfected the cure a woman of cloyne got cold after childbearing which occasioned a great pain in her thigh swelling also and redness she continued in great torment above three weeks she then began to drink tarwater but not drinking much she did not perceive much good and when there was not any hopes of her life she was persuaded to try what a gallon a day might do upon this she grew better the swelling broke and ran no dressing was used but tar and no washing but tarwater until she was quite recovered  in ailments of an odd and untried nature it may be worth while to try tarwater in proof of this many instances might be given a gentleman with a withered arm had it restored by drinking tarwater another who by running his head against a post had a concussion of the brain attended with very bad symptoms recovered by drinking tarwater after other medicines had failed in my own neighborhood one had lost the use of his limbs by poison another had been bitten by a mad ass these persons drank tarwater and their cure was attributed to it  when tarwater is copiously drank in fevers the great danger to be guarded against is an excessive flow of spirits which excites the patient to talk and divert himself with company which may produce a relapse of this i have known fatal effects  if in a course of tar water the patient should find himself heated let him abstain from or lessen his dose of spirituous and fermented liquors for tarwater alone never heats  in chronical disorders it is not advisable to break off a course of tarwater at once but rather to diminish the quantity by degrees  the acid alone has not the medicinal virtues of tarwater this is agreeable to reason and experience as well as the opinion of the ablest judges doctor linden justly observes that when the empyreumatic oil is entirely separated from the acid it is not in any shape superior to any other distilled acids or vinegars whatsoever treatise on selter water p  0   something of this nature has been long expected and hoped for if we may credit that learned chemist dr linden at last says he the long delayed wishes of the most eminent men of the faculty are fulfilled in the b of c  ynes discovery see treatise on selter water p  0  again speaking of empyreumatic oils of plants he has these words there has always prevailed a notion among the chemists and particularly with paracelsus and his followers that in those oils there lay a great secret undiscovered this notion was occasioned by the strange effects which a small quantity thereof has upon the human machine several have been very diligent to discover this secret and to find out a method to administer these oils with safety yet nothing was performed salutary until the b of c discovered to us the tarwater to him alone we are indebted for rendering the empyreumatic oils a safe medicine in every respect ibid p  0  that extraordinary virtues should be contained in tarwater will not seem strange if we consider that pitch is nothing else but hardened tar or tar drained of its moisture and that an extraordinary quantity of light is retained in the substance of pitch as appears from certain electrical experiments which having been made since seem not a little to confirm what had before been suggested in siris  an essay toward preventing the ruin of great britain  avaritia fidem probitatem caeterasque arts bonas subvertit pro his superbiam crudelitatem deos negligere omnia venalia habere edocuit sallust ii

persequendis inimicis agebant caesar first printed in london a d mdccxxi  an essay etc whether the prosperity that preceded or the calamities that succeed the south sea project have most contributed to our undoing is not so clear a point as it is that we are actually undone and lost to all sense of our true interest nothing less than this could render it pardonable to have recourse to those old fashioned trite maxims concerning religion industry frugality and public spirit which are now forgotten but if revived and put in practice may not only prevent our final ruin but also render us a more happy and flourishing people than ever  religion has in former days been cherished and reverenced by wise patriots and lawgivers as knowing it to be impossible that a nation should thrive and flourish without virtue or that virtue should subsist without conscience or conscience without religion insomuch that an atheist or infidel was looked on with abhorrence and treated as an enemy to his country but in these wiser times a cold indifference for the national religion and indeed for all matters of faith and divine worship is thought good sense it is even become fashionable to decry religion and that little talent of ridicule is applied to such wrong purposes that a good christian can hardly keep himself in countenance  liberty is the greatest human blessing that a virtuous man can possess and is very consistent with the duties of a good subject and a good christian but the present age abounds with injudicious patrons of liberty who not distinguishing between that and licentiousness take the surest method to discredit what they would seem to propagate for in effect can there be a greater affront offered to that just freedom of thought and action which is the prerogative of a rational creature or can any thing recommend it less to honest minds than under color thereof to obtrude scurrility and profaneness on the world but it has been always observed of weak men that they know not how to avoid one extreme without running into another  too many of this sort pass upon vulgar readers for great authors and men of profound thought not on account of any superiority either in sense or style both which they possess in a very moderate degree nor of any discoveries they have made in arts and sciences which they seem to be little acquainted with but purely because they flatter the passions of corrupt men who are pleased to have the clamours of conscience silenced and those great points of the christian religion made suspected which withheld them from many vices of pleasure and interest or made them uneasy in the commission of them  in order to promote that laudable design of effacing all sense of religion from among us they form themselves into assemblies and proceed with united counsels and endeavors with what success and with what merit toward the public the effect too plainly shows i will not say these gentlemen have formed a direct design to ruin their country or that they have the sense to see half the ill consequences which must necessarily flow from the spreading of their opinions but the nation feels them and it is high time the legislature put a stop to them  i am not for placing an invidious power in the hands of the clergy or complying with the narrowness of any mistaken zealots who should incline to persecute dissenters but whatever conduct common sense as well as christian charity obliges us to use toward those who differ from us in some points of religion yet the public safety requires that the avowed contemners of all religion should be severely chastised and perhaps it may be no easy matter to assign a good reason why blasphemy against god should not be inquired into and punished with the same rigor as treason against the king  for though we may attempt to patch up our affairs yet it will be to no purpose the finger of god will unravel all our vain projects and make them snares to draw us into greater calamities if we do not reform that scandalous libertinism which whatever some shallow men may think is our worst symptom and the surest prognostic of our ruin  industry is the natural sure way to wealth this is so true that it is impossible an industrious free people should want the necessaries and comforts of life or an idle enjoy them under any form of government money is so far useful to the public as it promoteth industry and credit having the same effect is of the same value with money but money or credit circulating through a nation from hand to hand without producing labor and industry in the inhabitants is direct gaming  it is not impossible for cunning men to make such plausible schemes as may draw those who are less skilful into their own and the public ruin but surely there is no man of sense and honesty but must see and own whether he understands the game or not that it is an evident folly for any people instead of prosecuting the old honest methods of industry and frugality to sit down to a public gamingtable and play off their money one to another  the more methods there are in a state for acquiring riches without industry or merit the less there will be of either in that state this is as evident as the ruin that attends it besides when money is shifted from hand to hand in such a blind fortuitous manner that some men shall from nothing in an instant acquire vast estates without the least desert while others are as suddenly stripped of plentiful fortunes and left on the parish by their own avarice and credulity what can be hoped for on the one hand but abandoned luxury and wantonness or on the other but extreme madness and despair  in short all project for growing rich by sudden and extraordinary methods as they operate violently on the passions of men and encourage them to despise the slow moderate gains that are to be made by an honest industry must be ruinous to the public and even the winners themselves will at length be involved in the public ruin  it is an easy matter to contrive projects for the encouragement of industry i wish it were as easy to persuade men to put them in practice there is no country in europe where there is so much charity collected for the poor and none where it is so ill managed if the poortax was fixed at a medium in every parish taken from a calculation of the last ten years and raised for seven years by act of parliament that sum if the common estimate be not very wrong frugally and prudently laid out in workhouses would for ever free the nation from the care of providing for the poor and at the same time considerably improve our manufactures we might by these means rid our streets of beggars even the children the maimed and the blind might be put in a way of doing something for their livelihood as for the small number of those who by age or infirmities are utterly incapable of all employment they might be maintained by the labor of others and the public would receive no small advantage from the industry of those who are now so great a burden and expense to it  the same tax continued three years longer might be very usefully employed in making high roads and rendering rivers navigable two things of so much profit and ornament to a nation that we seem the only people in europe who have neglected them this was published before turnpikes were erected  so that in the space of ten years the public may be for ever freed from a heavy tax industry encouraged commerce facilitated and the whole country improved and all this only by a frugal honest management without raising one penny extraordinary  the number of people is both means and motives to industry it should therefore be of great use to encourage propagation by allowing some reward or privilege to those who have a certain number of children and on the other hand enacting that the public shall inherit half the unintailed estates of all who die unmarried of either sex  besides the immediate end proposed by the foregoing methods they furnish taxes upon passengers and dead bachelors which are in no sort grievous to the subject and may be applied toward clearing the public debt which all mankind agree highly concerns the nation in general both court and country caesar indeed mentions it as a piece of policy that he borrowed money from his officers to bestow it on the soldiers which fixed both to his interest and though something like this may pass for skill at certain junctures in civil government yet if carried too far it will prove a dangerous experiment  there is still room for invention or improvement in most trades and manufactures and it is probable that praemiums given on that account to ingenious artists would soon be repaid an hundredfold to the public no color is so much wore in italy spain and portugal as black but our black cloth is neither so lasting nor of so good a dye as the dutch which is the reason of their engrossing the profit of that trade this is so true that i have known english merchants abroad wear black cloth of holland themselves and sell and recommend it as better than that of their own country it is commonly said the water of leyden has a peculiar property for coloring black but it has been also said and passed current that good glasses may be made no where but at venice and there only in the island of murano which was attributed to some peculiar property in the air and we may possibly find other opinions of that sort to be as groundless should the legislature think it worth while to propose praemiums in the foregoing or in the like cases of general benefit to the public but i remember to have seen about seven years ago a man pointed at in a coffeehouse who they said had first introduced the right scarlet dye among us by which the nation in general as well as many private persons have since been great gainers though he was himself a beggar who if this be true deserved an honorable maintenance from the public  there are also several manufactures which we have from abroad that may be carried on to as great perfection here as elsewhere if it be considered that more fine linen is wore in great britain than in any other country of europe it will be difficult to assign a reason why paper may not be made here as good and in the same quantity as in holland or france or genoa this is a manufacture of great consumption and would save much to the public the like may be said of tapestry lace and other manufactures which is set on foot in cheap parts of the country would employ many hands and save money to the nation as well as bring it from abroad projects for improving old manufactures or setting up new ones should not be despised in a trading country but the making them pretenses for stockjobbing has been a fatal imposition  as industry depends upon trade and this as well as the public security upon our navigation it concerns the legislature to provide that the number of our sailors do not decrease to which it would very much conduce if a law were made prohibiting the payment of sailors in foreign parts for it is usual with those on board merchantmen as soon as they set foot on shore to receive their pay which is soon spent in riotous living and when they have emptied their pockets the temptation of a pistole present money never fails to draw them into any foreign service to this if i may credit the information i have had from some english factors abroad it is chiefly owing that the venetians spaniards and others have so many english on board their ships some merchants indeed and masters of vessels may make a profit in defrauding those poor wretches when they pay them in strange coin which i have been assured often amounts to twelve pence in the crown as well as in ridding themselves of the charge of keeping them when they sell their ships or stay long in port but the public lose both the money and the men who if their arrears were to be cleared at home would be sure to return and spend them in their own country it is a shame this abuse should not be remedied  frugality of manners is the nourishment and strength of bodies politic it is that by which they grow and subsist until they are corrupted by luxury the natural cause of their decay and ruin of this we have examples in the persians lacedaemonians and romans not to mention many later governments which have sprung up continued a while and then perished by the same natural causes but these are it seems of no use to us and in spite of them we are in a fair way of becoming ourselves another useless example to future ages  men are apt to measure national prosperity by riches it would be righter to measure it by the use that is made of them where they promote an honest commerce among men and are motives to industry and virtue they are without doubt of great advantage but where they are made as too often happens an instrument to luxury they enervate and dispirit the bravest people so just is that remark of machiavel that there is no truth in the common saying money is the nerves of war and though we may subsist tolerably for a time among corrupt neighbors yet if ever we have to do with a hardy temperate religious sort of men we shall find to our cost that all our riches are but a poor exchange for that simplicity of manners which we despise in our ancestors this sole advantage has been the main support of all the republics that have made a figure in the world and perhaps it might be no ill policy in a kingdom to form itself upon the manners of a republic  simplicity of manners may be more easily preserved in a republic than a monarchy but if once lost may be sooner recovered in a monarchy the example of a court being of great efficacy either to reform or to corrupt a people that alone were sufficient to discountenance the wearing of gold or silver either in clothes or equipage and it the same were prohibited by law the saving so much bullion would be the smallest benefit of such an institution there being nothing more apt to debase the virtue and good sense of our gentry of both sexes than the trifling vanity of apparel which we have learned from france and which has had such visible ill consequences on the genius of that people wiser nations have made it their care to shut out this folly by severe laws and penalties and its spreading among us can forbode no good if there be any truth in the observation of one of the ancients that the direct way to ruin a man is to dress him up in fine clothes  it cannot be denied that luxury of dress gives a light behavior to our women which may pass for a small offense because it is a common one but is in truth the source of great corruptions for this very offense the prophet isaiah denounced a severe judgment against the ladies of his time i shall give the passage at length moreover the lord says because the daughters of zion are haughty and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes walking and mincing as they go and making a tinkling with their feet therefore the lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of zion and the lord will discover their secret parts in that day the lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet and their cauls and their round tires like the moon the chains and the bracelets and the mufflers the bonnets and the ornaments of the legs and the headbands and the tablets and the earrings the rings and nose jewels the changeable suits of apparel and the mantles and the wimples and the crisping pins the glasses and the fine linen and the hoods and the vails and it shall come to pass that instead of a sweet smell there shall be a stink and instead of a girdle a rent and instead of wellset hair baldness and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth and burning instead of beauty the scab the stench and the burning are terrible pestilential symptoms and our ladies would do well to consider they may chance to resemble those of zion in their punishment as well as their offense  but dress is not the only thing to be reformed sumptuary laws are useful in many other points in former times the natural plainness and good sense of the english made them less necessary but ever since the luxurious reign of king charles the second we have been doing violence to our natures and are by this time so much altered for the worse that it is to be feared the very same dispositions that make them necessary will for ever hinder them from being enacted or put in execution  a private family in difficult circumstances all men agree ought to melt down their plate walk on foot retrench the number of their servants wear neither jewels nor rich clothes and deny themselves expensive diversions and why not the public had any thing like this been done our taxes had been less or which is the same thing we should have felt them less but it is very remarkable that luxury was never at so great a height nor spread so generally through the nation as during the expense of the late wars and the heavy debt that still lies upon us  this vice draws after it a train of evils which cruelly infest the public faction ambition envy avarice and that of the worst kind being much more hurtful in its consequences though not so infamous as penury it was the great art of cardinal richelieu by encouraging luxury and expense to impoverish the french nobility and render them altogether dependent on the crown which has been since very successfully effected these and many more considerations show the necessity there is for sumptuary laws nor can any thing be said against them in this island which might not with equal force be objected in other countries which have nevertheless judged the public benefit of such institutions to be of far greater importance than the short sufferings of a few who subsist by the luxury of others  it is evident that old taxes may be better born as well as new ones raised by sumptuary laws judiciously framed not to damage our trade but retrench our luxury it is evident that for want of these luxury which like the other fashions never fails to descend has infected all ranks of people and that this enableth the dutch and french to undersell us to the great prejudice of our traffic we cannot but know that in our present circumstances it should be our care as it is our interest to make poverty tolerable in short we have the experience of many ages to convince us that a corrupt luxurious people must of themselves fall into slavery although no attempt be made upon them these and the like obvious reflections should one would think have forced any people in their senses upon frugal measures  but we are doomed to be undone neither the plain reason of the thing nor the experience of past ages nor the examples we have before our eyes can restrain us from imitating not to say surpassing the most corrupt and ruined people in those very points of luxury that ruined them our gaming our operas our maskerades are in spite of our debts and poverty become the wonder of our neighbors if there be any man so void of all thought and common sense as not to see where this must end let him but compare what venice was at the league of cambray with what it is at present and he will be convinced how truly those fashionable pastimes are calculated to depress and ruin a nation  but neither venice nor paris nor any other town in any part of the world ever knew such an expensive ruinous folly as our maskerade this alone is sufficient to inflame and satisfy the several appetites for gaming dressing intriguing luxurious eating and drinking it is a most skilful abridgment the very quintessence the abstract of all those senseless vanities that have ever been the ruin of fools and detestation of wise men and all this under the notion of an elegant entertainment has been admitted among us though it be in truth a contagion of the worst kind the plague dreadful as it is is an evil of short duration cities have often recovered and flourished after it but when was it known that a people broken and corrupt by luxury recovered themselves not to say that general corruption of manners never fails to draw after it some heavy judgment of war famine or pestilence of this we have a fresh instance in one of the most debauched towns of europe marseilles  and no body knows how soon it may be our own case this elegant entertainment is indeed suspended for the present but there remains so strong a propension toward it that if the wisdom of the legislature does not interpose it will soon return with the additional temptation of having been forbid for a time it were stupid and barbarous to declaim against keeping up the spirit of the people by proper diversions but then they should be proper such as polish and improve their mind or increase the strength and activity of their bodies none of which ends are answered by the maskerade no more than by those french and italian follies which to our shame are imported and encouraged at a time when the nation ought to be too grave for such trifles  it is not to be believed what influence public diversions have on the spirit and manners of a people the greeks wisely saw this and made a very serious affair of their public sports for the same reason it will perhaps seem worthy the care of our legislature to regulate the public diversions by an absolute prohibition of those which have a direct tendency to corrupt our morals as well as by a reformation of the drama which when rightly managed is such a noble entertainment and gave those fine lessons of morality and good sense to the athenians of old and to our british gentry above a century ago but for these last ninety years has entertained us for the most part with such wretched things as spoil instead of improving the taste and manners of the audience those who are attentive to such propositions only as may fill their pockets will probably slight these things as trifles below the care of the legislature but i am sure all honest thinking men must lament to see their country run headlong into all those luxurious follies which it is evident have been fatal to other nations and will undoubtedly prove fatal to us also if a timely stop be not put to them  public spirit that glorious principle of all that is great and good is so far from being cherished or encouraged that it is become ridiculous in this enlightened age which is taught to laugh at every thing that is serious as well as sacred the same atheistical narrow spirit centring all our cares upon private interest and contracting all our hopes within the enjoyment of this present life equally produces a neglect of what we owe to god and our country tully has long since observed that it is impossible for those who have no belief of the immortality of the soul or a future state of rewards and punishments to sacrifice their particular interests and passions to the public good or have a generous concern for posterity and our own experience confirms the truth of this observation  in order therefore to recover a sense of public spirit it is to be wished that men were first affected with a true sense of religion pro aris and focis having ever been the great motive to courage and perseverance in a public cause  it would likewise be a very useful policy and warranted by the example of the wisest governments to make the natural love of fame and reputation subservient to promoting that noble principle triumphal arches columns statues inscriptions and the like monuments of public services have in former times been found great incentives to virtue and magnanimity and would probably have the same effects on englishmen which they have had on greeks and romans and perhaps a pillar of infamy would be found a proper and exemplary punishment in cases of signal public villainy where the loss of fortune liberty or life are not proportioned to the crime or where the skill of the offender or the nature of his offense may skreen him from the letter of the law  several of these are to be seen at genoa milan and other towns of italy where it is the custom to demolish the house of a citizen who has conspired the ruin of his country or been guilty of any enormous crime toward the public and in place thereof to erect a monument of the crime and criminal described in the blackest manner we have nothing of this sort that i know but that which is commonly called the monument which in the last age was erected for an affair no way more atrocious than the modern unexampled attempt the south sea project of men easy in their fortunes and unprovoked by hardships of any sort in cool blood and with open eyes to ruin their native country this fact will never be forgotten and it were to be wished that with it the public detestation thereof may be transmitted to posterity which would in some measure vindicate the honor of the present and be a useful lesson to future ages  those noble arts of architecture sculpture and paintings do not only adorn the public but have also an influence on the minds and manners of men filling them with great ideas and spiriting them up to an emulation of worthy actions for this cause they were cultivated and encouraged by the greek cities who vied with each other in building and adorning their temples theaters porticos and the like public works at the same time that they discouraged private luxury the very reverse of our conduct  to propose the building a parliament house courts of justice royal palace and other public edifices suitable to the dignity of the nation and adorning them with paintings and statues which may transmit memorable things and persons to posterity would probably be laughed at as a vain affair of great expense and little use to the public and it must be owned we have reduced ourselves to such straits that any proposition of expencesuiteth ill with our present circumstances but how proper soever this proposal may be for the times yet it comes so properly into a discourse of public spirit that i could not but say something of it and at another time it will not seem unreasonable if we consider that it is no more than the wisest nations have done before us that it would spirit up new arts employ many hands keep the money circulating at home and lastly that it would be a notable instance of public spirit as well as a motive to it  the same noble principle may be also encouraged by erecting an academy of ingenious men whose employment it would be to compile the history of great britain to make discourses proper to inspire men with a zeal for the public and celebrate the memory of those who have been ornaments to the nation or done it eminent service not to mention that this would improve our language and amuse some busy spirits of the age which perhaps would be no ill policy  this is not without example for to say nothing of the french academy which is prostituted to meaner purposes it has been the custom of the venetian senate to appoint one of their order to continue the history of the republic this was introduced in the flourishing state of that people and is still in force we fall short of other nations in the number of good historians though no nation in christendom has produced greater events or more worthy to be recorded the athenian senate appointed orators to commemorate annually those who died in defense of their country which solemnity was performed at the monuments erected in honor of them by the public and the panegyrics composed by isocrates and pericles as well as many passages in tully inform us with what pleasure the ancient orators used to expatiate in praise of their country  concord and union among ourselves is rather to be hoped for as an effect of public spirit than proposed as a means to promote it candid generous men who are true lovers of their country can never be enemies to one half of their countrymen or carry their resentment so far as to ruin the public for the sake of a party now i have fallen upon the mention of our parties i shall beg leave to insert a remark or two for the service both of whig and tory without entering into their respective merits first it is impossible for either party to ruin the other without involving themselves and their posterity in the same ruin secondly it is very feasible for either paty to get the better of the other if they could first get the better of themselves and instead of indulging the little womanish passions of obstinacy resentment and revenge steadily promote the true interest of their country in those great clear points of piety industry sobriety of manners and an honest regard for posterity which all men of sense agree are essential to public happiness there would be something so great and good in this conduct as must necessarily overbear all calumny and opposition but that men should act reasonably is rather to be wished than hoped  i am well aware that to talk of public spirit and the means of retrieving it must to narrow sordid minds be matter of jest and ridicule how conformable soever it be to right reason and the maxims of antiquity though one would think the most selfish man might see it was their interest to encourage a spirit in others by which they to be sure must be gainers yet such is the corruption and folly of the present age that a public spirit is treated like ignorance of the world and want of sense and all the respect is paid to cunning men who bend and wrest the public interest to their own private ends that in other times has been thought due to those who were generous enough to sacrifice their private interest to that of their country  such practices and such maxims as these must necessarily ruin a state but if the contrary should prevail we may hope to see men in power prefer the public wealth and security to their own and men of money make free gifts or lend it without interest to their country this how strange and incredible soever it may seem to us has been often done in other states and the natural english temper considered together with the force of example no one can tell how far a proposal for a free gift may go among the moneyed men when set on foot by the legislature and encouraged by the example of two or three men of figure who have the spirit to do a generous thing and the understanding to see it is every private mans interest to support that of the public  if they who have their fortunes in money should make a voluntary gift the public would be eased and at the same time maintain its credit nor is a generous love of their country the only motive that should induce them to this common equity requires that all subjects should equally share the public burden and common sense shows that those who are foremost in the danger should not be the most backward in contributing to prevent it  before i leave this subject i cannot but take notice of that most infamous practice of bribery than which nothing can be more opposite to public spirit since every one who takes a bribe plainly owns that he prefers his private interest to that of his country this corruption is become a national crime having infected the lowest as well as the highest among us and is so general and notorious that as it cannot be matched in former ages so it is to be hoped it will not be imitated by posterity  this calls to mind another national guilt which we possess in a very eminent degree there being no nation under the sun where solemn perjury is so common or where there are such temptations to it the making men swear so often in their own cases and where they have an interest to conceal the truth has gradually wore off that awful respect which was once thought due to an appeal to almighty god insomuch that men now a days break their fast and a customhouse oath with the same peace of mind it is a policy peculiar to us the obliging men to perjure or betray themselves and has had no one good effect but many very ill ones sure i am that other nations without the hundredth part of our swearing contrive to do their business at least as well as we do and perhaps our legislature will think it proper to follow their example for whatever measures are taken so long as we lie under such a load of guilt as national perjury and national bribery it is impossible we can prosper  this poor nation has sorely smarted of late and to ease the present smart a sudden remedy as is usual in such cases has been thought of but we must beware not to mistake an anodyne for a cure where the vitals are touched and the whole mass of humors vitiated it is not enough to ease the part pained we must look further and apply general correctives otherwise the ill humor may soon show itself in some other part  the south sea affair how sensible soever is not the original evil or the great source of our misfortunes it is but the natural effect of those principles which for many years have been propagated with great industry and as a sharp distemper by reclaiming a man from intemperance may prolong his life so it is not impossible but this public calamity that lies so heavy on the nation may prevent its ruin it would certainly prove the greatest of blessings if it should make all honest men of one party if it should put religion and virtue in countenance restore a sense of public spirit and convince men it is a dangerous folly to pursue private aims in opposition to the good of their country if it should turn our thoughts from cozenage and stockjobbing to industry and frugal methods of life in fine if it should revive and inflame that native spark of british worth and honor which has too long lain smothered and oppressed  with this view i have among so many projects for remedying the ill state of our affairs in a particular instance ventured to publish the foregoing general hints which as they have been thrown together from a zeal for the public good so i heartily wish they may be regarded neither more nor less than as they are fitted to promote that end  though it must be owned that little can be hoped if we consider the corrupt degenerate age we live in i know it is an old folly to make peevish complaints of the times and charge the common failures of human nature on a particular age one may nevertheless venture to affirm that the present has brought forth new and portentous villainies not to be paralleled in our own or any other history we have been long preparing for some great catastrophe vice and villainy have by degrees grown reputable among us our infidels have passed for fine gentlemen and our venal traitors for men of sense who knew the world we have made a jest of public spirit and cancelled all respect for whatever our laws and religion repute sacred the old english modesty is quite worn off and instead of blushing for our crimes we are ashamed only of piety and virtue in short other nations have been wicked but we are the first who have been wicked upon principle  the truth is our symptoms are so bad that notwithstanding all the care and vigilance of the legislature it is to be feared the final period of our state approaches strong constitutions whether politic or natural do not feel light disorders but when they are sensibly affected the distemper is for the most part violent and of an ill prognostic free governments like our own were planted by the goths in most parts of europe and though we all know what they are come to yet we seem disposed rather to follow their example than to profit by it  whether it be in the order of things that civil states should have like natural products their several periods of growth perfection and decay or whether it be an effect as seems more probable of human folly that as industry produces wealth so wealth should produce vice and vice ruin  god grant the time be not near when men shall say this island was once inhabited by a religious brave sincere people of plain incorrupt manners respecting inbred worth rather than titles and appearances assertors of liberty lovers of their country jealous of their own rights and unwilling to infringe the rights of others improvers of learning and useful arts enemies to luxury tender of other mens lives and prodigal of their own inferior in nothing to the old greeks or romans and superior to each of those people in the perfections of the other such were our ancestors during their rise and greatness but they degenerated grew servile flatterers of men in power adopted epicurean notions became venal corrupt injurious which drew upon them the hatred of god and man and occasioned their final ruin  a discourse addressed to magistrates and men in authority occasioned by the enormous license and irreligion of the times  gallio cared for none of those things acts chapter xviii ver    first printed a d mdccxxxvi  a discourse addressed to magistrates etc the pretensions and discourse of men throughout these kingdoms would at first view lead one to think the inhabitants were all politicians and yet perhaps political wisdom has in no age or country been more talked of and less understood license is taken for the end of government and popular humor for its origin no reverence for the law no attachment to the constitution little attention to matters of consequence and great altercation upon trifles such idle projects about religion and government as if the public had both to choose a general contempt of all authority divine and human an indifference about the prevailing opinions whether they tend to produce order or disorder to promote the empire of god or the devil these are the symptoms that strongly mark the present age and this could never have been the case if a neglect of religion had not made way for it  when the jews accused paul upon religious matters and points of their law before gallio the roman magistrate it is said that gallio cared for none of those things and it is to be feared there are not a few magistrates in this christian country who think with the same indifference on the subject of religion herein nevertheless they judge amiss and are much wanting to their duty for although it be admitted that the magistrates peculiar object is the temporal welfare of the state yet this will by no means exclude a proper care about the prevailing notions and opinions of religion which influence the lives and actions of men and have therefore a mighty effect on the public mens behavior is the consequence on their principles hence it follows that in order to make a state thrive and flourish care must be taken that good principles be propagated in the minds of those who compose it  it would be vain to depend on the outward form the constitution and structure of a state while the majority are ever governed by their inward ways of thinking which at times will break out and show themselves paramount to all laws and institutions whatsoever it must be great folly therefore to overlook notion as matters of small moment to the state while experience shows there is nothing more important and that a prevailing disorder in the principles and opinions of its members is ever dangerous to society and capable of producing the greatest public evils  man is an animal formidable both from his passions and his reason his passions often urging him to great evils and his reason furnishing means to atchieve them to tame this animal and make him amenable to order to inure him to a sense of justice and virtue to withhold him from ill courses by fear and encourage him in his duty by hopes in short to fashion and model him for society has been the aim of civil and religious institutions and in all times the endeavor of good and wise men the aptest method for attaining this end has been always judged a proper education  if mens actions are an effect of their principles that is of their notions their belief their persuasions it must be admitted that principles early sown in the mind are the seeds which produce fruit and harvest in the ripe state of manhood how lightly soever some men may speak of notions yet so long as the soul governs the body mens notions must influence their actions more or less as they are stronger or weaker and to good or evil as they are better or worse  our notions and opinions are a constant check on our appetites and balance to our passions and although they may not in every instance control and rule yet they will never fail strongly to affect both the one and the other what is it that bridles the impetuous desires of men that restrains them when they are driven by the most violent passions in a word what is it that renders this world habitable but the prevailing notions of order virtue duty and providence some perhaps may imagine that the eye of the magistrate alone is sufficient to keep mankind in awe but if every mans heart was set to do all the mischief his appetite should prompt him to as often as opportunity and secrecy presented themselves there could be no living in the world  and although too many of those entrusted with civil power in these our days may be said with gallio to care for none of those things and many more who would pass for men of judgment and knowledge may look on notions early imbibed before their grounds and reasons are apprehended or understood to be but mere prejudices yet this will detract nothing from their truth and usefulness to place this matter in a due light i propose to show that a system of salutary notions is absolutely necessary to the support of every civil constitution i shall enforce this point by the testimony of those who are esteemed the wisest men and i shall make some remarks on the modern prevailing spirit and the tendency of the maxims of our times  order is necessary not only to the wellbeing but to the very being of a state now order and regularity in the actions of men is not an effect of appetite or passion but of judgment and the judgment is governed by notions or opinions there must therefore of necessity in every state be a certain system of salutary notions a prevailing set of opinions acquired either by private reason and reflection or taught and instilled by the general reason of the public that is by the law of the land true it is that where men either cannot or will not use their own reason think and examine for themselves in such case the notions taught or instilled into their minds are embraced rather by the memory than the judgment nor will it be any objection to say that these are prejudices inasmuch as they are therefore neither the less useful nor the less true although their proofs may not be understood by all men  prejudices are notions or opinions which the mind entertains without knowing the grounds and reasons of them and which are assented to without examination the first notions which take possession of the minds of men with regard to duties social moral and civil may therefore be justly styled prejudices the mind of a young creature cannot remain empty if you do not put into it that which is good it will be sure to receive that which is bad  do what you can there will still be a bias from education and if so is it not better this bias should lie toward things laudable and useful to society this bias still operates although it may not always prevail the notions first instilled have the earliest influence take the deepest root and generally are found to give a color and complexion to the subsequent lives of men inasmuch as they are in truth the great source of human actions it is not gold or honor or power that move men to act but the opinions they entertain of those things hence it follows that if a magistrate should say no matter what notions men embrace i will take heed to their actions therein he shows his weakness for such as are mens notions such will be their deeds  for a man to do as he would be done by to love his neighbor as himself to honor his superiors to believe that god scans all his actions and will reward or punish them and to think that he who is guilty of falsehood or injustice hurts himself more than any one else are not these such notions and principles as every wife governor or legislator would covet above all things to have firmly rooted in the mind of every individual under his care this is allowed even by the enemies of religion who would fain have it thought the offspring of state policy honoring its usefulness at the same time that they disparage its truth what therefore cannot be acquired by every mans reasoning must be introduced by precept and riveted by custom that is to say the bulk of mankind must in all civilized societies have their minds by timely instruction well seasoned and furnished with proper notions which although the grounds or proofs thereof be unknown to them will nevertheless influence their conduct and so far render them useful members of the state but if you strip men of these their notions or if you will prejudices with regard to modesty decency justice charity and the like you will soon find them so many monsters utterly unfit for human society  i desire it may be considered that most men want leisure opportunity or faculties to derive conclusions from their principles and establish morality on a foundation of human science true it is as st paul observes that the invisible things of god from the creation of the world are clearly seen romans chapter i ver  0 and from thence the duties of natural religion may be discovered but these things are seen and discovered by those alone who open their eyes and look narrowly for them now if you look throughout the world you shall find but few of these narrow inspectors and inquirers very few who make it their business to analyze opinions and pursue them to their rational source to examine whence truths spring and how they are inferred in short you shall find all men full of opinions but knowledge only in a few  it is impossible from the nature and circumstances of human kind that the multitude should be philosophers or that they should know things in their causes we see every day that the rules or conclusions alone are sufficient for the shopkeeper to state his account the sailor to navigate his ship or the carpenter to measure his timber none of which understand the theory that is to say the grounds and reasons either of arithmetic or geometry even so in moral political and religious matters it is manifest that the rules and opinions early imbibed at the first dawn of understanding and without the least glimpse of science may yet produce excellent effects and be very useful to the world and that in fact they are so will be very visible to every one who shall observe what passes round about him  it may not be amiss to inculcate that the difference between prejudices and other opinions does not consist in this that the former are false and the latter true but in this that the former are taken upon trust and the latter acquired by reasoning he who has been taught to believe the immortality of the soul may be as right in his notion as he who has reasoned himself into that opinion it will then by no means follow that because this or that notion is a prejudice it must be therefore false the not distinguishing between prejudices and errors is a prevailing oversight among our modern freethinkers  there may be indeed certain mere prejudices or opinions which having no reasons either assigned or assignable to support them are neverthess entertained by the mind because they intruded betimes into it such may be supposed false not because they were early learned or learned without their reasons but because there are in truth no reasons to be given for them  certainly if a notion may be concluded false because it was early imbibed or because it is with most men an object of belief rather than of knowledge one may by the same reasoning conclude several propositions of euclid to be false a simple apprehension of conclusions as taken in themselves without the deductions of science is what falls to the share of mankind in general religious awe the precepts of parents and masters the wisdom of legislators and the accumulated experience of ages supply the place of proofs and reasonings with the vulgar of all ranks i would say that discipline national constitution and laws human or divine are so many plain land marks which guide them into the paths wherein it is presumed they ought to tread  from what has been premised it plainly appears that in the bulk of mankind there are and must be prejudices that is opinions taken upon trust or in other words that there are points of faith among all men whatsoever as well as among christians  and as it is evident that the unthinking part of every age sex and condition among us must necessarily receive notions with the submission of faith so it is very reasonable that they should submit their faith to the greatest authorities human and divine the law and the gospel but if once all reverence for these be destroyed our pretenders to moral knowledge will have no authority to imbue the multitude with such notions as may control their appetites from all which it follows that the modern schemes of our freethinkers who pretend to separate morality from religion how rational soever they may seem to their admirers are in truth and effect most irrational and pernicious to civil society  let any one who thinks at all consider the savage state of undisciplined men whose minds are nurtured to no doctrine broke by no instruction governed by no principle let him at the same time reflect on a society of persons educated in the principles of our church formed betimes to fear god to reverence their superiors to be grateful to their benefactors forgiving to their enemies just and charitable to all men and he will then be able to judge of the merits of those who are so active to weed out the prejudices of education  among the many wild notions broached in these giddy times it must be owned that some of our declaimers against prejudice have wrought themselves into a sort of esteem for savages as a virtuous and unprejudiced people in proof of which they allege their being free from many vices practiced in civilized nations now it is very true among savages there are few instances to be found of luxury avarice or ambition not that the contrary virtues take place but because the opportunities and faculties for such vices are wanting for the same reason you do not see them in brutes  what they esteem and admire in those creatures is not innocence but ignorance it is not virtue but necessity give them but the means of transgressing and they know no bounds for example supply the waterdrinking savage with strong liquor and he shall be drunk for several days and nights together again we admit an uneducated savage knows not how to supplant a rival with the refined treachery of a courtier yet if you put his foe once in his power you shall soon see what a horrible relish and delight the monster has in cruelty  above all others religious notions or if you will prejudices since this as has been already observed detracts nothing from their truth and usefulness have the most influence they are the strongest curb from vice and the most effectual spur to worthy conduct and indeed whether we consider the reason of things or the practice of men in all times we shall be satisfied that nothing truly great and good can enter into the heart of one attached to no principles of religion who believes no providence who neither fears hell nor hopes for heaven  punishments and rewards have always had and always will have the greatest weight with men and the most considerable of both kinds are proposed by religion the duties whereof fall in with the views of the civil magistrate it undeniably follows that nothing can add more strength to a good and righteous government than religion therefore it mainly concerns governors to keep an attentive eye on the religion of their subjects and indeed it is one lesson to magistrate and people prince and subject keep my commandments and live and my law as the apple of thine eye prove chapter vii ver     although it is no consequence from what has been said that men should be debarred the free use of reason and inquiry yet surely it will follow that without good reason a man should not reject those notions which have been instilled by the laws and education of his country and even they who think they have such reason have nevertheless no right of dictating though a mans private judgment be a rule to himself it will not thence follow that he has any right to set up for a rule to others to others it is true divine authority is superior to all human prejudices institutions and regards whatsoever and it is wise although at the risk of liberty or life to obey god rather than man but our modern reformers of prejudice have nothing to plead no man can say he is obliged in conscience honor or prudence to insult the public wisdom or to ridicule the laws under whose protection he lives of that kind  there is no magistrate so ignorant as not to know that power physical power resides in the people but authority is from opinion which authority is necessary to restrain and direct the peoples power and therefore religion is the great stay and support of a state every religion that inculcates virtue and discourageth vice is so far of public benefit the christian religion does noth only this but further makes every legal constitution sacred by commanding our submission thereto let every soul be subject to the higher powers says st paul for the powers that be are ordained of god romans chapter xiii ver    and in effect for several years past while the reverence for our church and religion has been decaying and wearing off from the minds of men it may be observed that loyalty has in proportion lost ground and now the very word seems quite forgotten submission for conscience as well as for wrath was once reckoned an useful lesson but now with other good lessons is laid aside as an obsolete prejudice  that prince or magistrate however great or powerful who thinks his own authority sufficient to make him respected and obeyed lies under a woeful mistake and never fails to feel it sooner or later obedience to all civil power is rooted in the religious fear of god it is propagated preserved and nourished by religion this makes men obey not with eyeservice but in sincerity of heart human regards may restrain men from open and penal offenses but the fear of god is a restraint from all degrees of all crimes however circumstanced take away this stay and prop of duty this root of civil authority and all that was sustained by it or grew from it shall soon languish the authority the very being of the magistrate will prove a poor and precarious thing  an inward sense of the supreme majesty of the king of kings is the only thing that can beget and preserve a true respect for subordinate majesty in all the degrees of power the first link of authority being fixed at the throne of god but in these our days that majestas imperii that sacredness of character which rooted in a religious principle was the great guard and security of the state is through want thereof become the public scorn and indeed what hold can the prince or magistrate have on the conscience of those who have no conscience how can he build on the principles of such as have no principles or how can he hope for respect where god himself is neglected  it is manifest that no prince upon earth can hope to govern well or even to live easy and secure much less respected by his people if he do not contribute by his example and authority to keep up in their minds an awful sense of religion as for a moral sense and moral fitness or eternal relations how insufficient those things are for establishing general and just notions of morality or for keeping men within due bounds is so evident from fact and experience that i need not now enter into a particular disquisition about them see alciphron dial iii and iv   it must be owned that the claws of rapine and violence may in some degree be pared and blunted by the outward polity of a state but should we not rather try if possible to pull them quite out the evil effects of wickedness may be often redressed by public justice but would it not be better to heal the source and by an inward principle extirpate wickedness from the heart rather than depend altogether on human laws for preventing or redressing the bad effects thereof i might said the chinese doctor confucius hear and decide controversies as well as another but what i would have is that men should be brought to abstain from controversies out of an inward love and regard for each other scientia sin lib i fol      too many in this age of free remarks and projects are delighted with republican schemes and imagine they might remedy whatever was amiss and render a people great and happy merely by a new plan or form of government this dangerous way of thinking and talking is grown familiar through the foolish men forget that liberty consists in a mean or that there is any other extreme beside tyranny freedom of the times but alas those men do not seem to have touched either the true cause or cure of public evils be the plan ever so excellent or the architects ever so able yet no man in his wits would undertake to build a palace with mere mud or dirt there must be fit materials and without a religious principle men can never be fit materials for any society much less for a republic religion is the center which unites and the cement which connects the several parts or members of the political body such it has been held by all wise men from the remotest times down to our ingenious contemporaries who if they are in the right it must be admitted that all the rest of the world have been in the wrong  from the knowledge of its being absolutely necessary to the government of a state that the hearts and minds of the people be inwardly imbued with good principles plato in protagora tells that  jupiter to preserve the race of men from perishing sent mercury with orders to introduce modesty and justice among them as the firmest ties of human society and without which it could not subsist and elsewhere the same author gives it plainly as his sense that de legibus lib viii concerning those great duties which mens appetites and passions render difficult it should seem rather the work of god to provide than of human legislators if it were possible to hope for a system of laws framed and promulgated by god himself you see how agreeable the mosaic and christian institutions are to the wishes of the wisest heathen  moses indeed does not insist on a future state the common basis of all political institutions nor do other lawgivers make a particular mention of all things necessary but suppose some things as generally known or believed the belief of a future state which it is manifest the jews were possessed of long before the coming of christ seems to have obtained among the hebrews from primaeval tradition which might render it unnecessary for moses to insist on that article but the sadducee and epicureans had in progress of time gone so far toward rooting out this ancient and origina sentiment that it was in danger of being lost had it not been taught and promulgated in a new light by our blessed savior  but many among us who would pass for assertors of truth and liberty are accustomed to rail at this and all other established opinions as prejudices which people are taught whether they will or no and before they are able to distinguish whether they are right or wrong these lovers of truth would do well to consider that in political moral and religious matters the opinions of the vulgar whether they go in coaches or walk on foot are for the most part prejudices and are so like to be whatever side of the question they embrace whether they follow the old maxims of the religion of their country or the modern instructions of their new masters i have already observed that a points being useful and inculcated betimes can be no argument of its falsehood even although it should be a prejudice far otherwise unity and truth are not to be divided the general good of mankind being the rule or measure of moral truth see alciphron dial i sect      i shall now add that it is to be apprehended many of those who are the most forward to banish prejudices would be the first to feel the want of them it is even pitiful to think what would be come of certain moderate declaimers on that article were prejudice really set aside and were all men to be weighed in the exact scale of merit and considered in proportion only to their intrinsic worth some prejudices are grounded in truth reason and nature such are the respects which are paid to knowledge learning age honesty and courage in all civilized countries others are purely the effect of particular constitutions such are the respects rights and preeminences ascribed to some men by their fellow subjects on account of their birth and quality which in the great empires of turkey and china pass for nothing and will pass for nothing elsewhere as soon as men have got rid of their prejudices and learned to despise the constitutions of their country it may behove those who are concerned to reflect on this betimes  god comprehending within himself the beginning end and middle of all things and times exerts his energy throughout the whole creation he never cease to influence by instinct by the light of nature by his declared will and it is the duty of magistrates and lawgivers to cultivate and encourage those divine impressions in the minds of all men under their care we are not to think it is the work of god and therefore not to be seconded by human care far otherwise for that very reason it claims our utmost care and diligence it being the indispensible duty of all good men throughout the whole course of their lives to cooperate with the designs of providence in religion as in nature god does somewhat and somewhat is to be done on the part of man he causes the earth to bring forth materials for food and raiment but human industry must improve prepare and properly apply both the one and the other or mankind may perish with cold and hunger and according to this fame analogy it will be sufficient if such analogy appears between the dispensations of grace and nature as may make it probable to suppose them derived from the same author  alciphron dial vi sect      the principles of piety and religion the things that belong to our salvation although originally and primarily the work of god yet require the protection of human government as well as the furtherance and aid of all wise and good men  and if religion in all governments be necessary yet it seems to be so more especially in monarchies forasmuch as the frugal manners and more equal fortunes in republics do not so much inflame mens appetites or afford such power or temptation to mischief as the high estate and great wealth of nobles under a king therefore although the magistrate as was already observed has for his peculiar object the temporal wellbeing of the state yet this will by no means exempt him from a due concern for the religion of his country  what was the sense of our ancestors on this point appears throughout the whole constitution of these kingdoms and in order to justify this constitution and the wisdom of those who framed it i shall crave leave to make use of some unsuspected testimonies ancient and modern which will show that the public care of a national religion has been always a most principal point in the esteem of wise men however run down by the prevailing license of our times  the first testimnny i shall produce is that of zaleucus the famous lawgiver of the locrians who in his preamble to his laws stobaeus de leg and consuet ser     begins with religion laying it down as the cornerstone or foundation of his whole superstructure that every inhabitant subject of the state should be persuaded that there is a god and divine providence that the only way of becoming dear to god is by endeavoring above all things to be good both in deed and in will that a worthy citizen is one that prefers integrity to wealth he further admonishes those who are difficult to persuade to bethink themselves of gods providence and the punishments that await evildoers and in all their actions to be ever mindful of the last day as if it were present or in case the  devil should tempt a man to sin he exhorts such a one to frequent the temples and altars worshipping and imploring the divine assistance  aristotle de republ lib v discoursing of the means to preserve a monarchy admonishes the supreme magistrate above all things to show himself zealous in religious matters and this particularly for two reasons   because the subjects will have less to fear from one who fears god   because they will be less apt to rebel against him whom they take to be the favorite of heaven and elsewhere this same philosopher recommends the worship of the gods as the first care of the state ibid lib vii cap    and lib vi   plato likewise begins his laws with the care of religious rites he even maintains religion or divine worship to be the chief aim and scope of human life de leg lib iv   hippodamus the milesian arist de republ lib ii cap   in his scheme of a republic allotted a third part of the land for maintaining divine worship the abolishing of the christian religion upon a frugal principle must be bad policy if we may judge what will be by what has been in the great pagan states of antiquity whose religions upon a fair estimate will be found to have been more expensive   the roman historians and poets do so abound with passages ascribing the successes of their government to religion and its declension to the want or neglect thereof that it may seem impertinent to enter into a detail of what every schoolboy knows  to come from ancient to modern authority machiavel himself represents religion as absolutely necessary to maintain civil order and government he observes that for many years there was a most awful sense of religion in the old romans and that this did much facilitate their great undertakings he likewise observes and shows by diverse instances that the romans were more afraid to break an oath than to transgress the laws and that those things which even the love of their country and constitution could not bring them to they were brought to through a sense of religion upon the whole he concludes that old rome was more obliged to numa who established a national religion than to romulus himself the founder of that state discorsi lib i cap      and here by the by i shall take notice that some may imagine the various forms and institutions of religion ought to unsettle mens minds with regard to the truth and certainty of any but this matter rightly considered will i think produce a contrary effect it shows indeed that men groping out their way by the dim twilight of nature did only approach some nearer some farther off while all were short of the truth but then shows likewise upon the whole and in general that religion is so natural to our minds so useful to society and of so necessary importance to the world as might well prove its truth and render it worthy of the divine care to propagate by prophecies miracles and the mission of the son of god  philip de comines hist b   a wise statesman and honest writer who had great experience in affairs declares it to be his opinion that want of religious faith is the only foundation of all mischiefs  and that able minister the famous monsieur colbert test pol c   makes it his observation that if once the ecclesiastical character as such is vilified the civil magistrate even the crown itself will in consequence thereof lose all authority  it would be no hard matter to produce a cloud of testimonies in behalf of a national religion from the most eminent of our own writers but i shall content myself with adding one only and that from a very unsuspected writer mr harrington author of the oceana who shows that to be just and fair which others have showed to be expedient  p    first edit a man says he that pleading for liberty of conscience refuses liberty to the national conscience must be most absurd and again if the conviction of a mans private conscience produce his private religion the conviction of the national conscience must produce a national religion ibid   all these authorities are taken from thinking men and able politicians none of which can be supposed to say what he did not really think and it had been very easy to have increased the number but i am sorry i was obliged to mention any at all in proof of so plain and fundamental a point as that of a national religion it is indeed a shameful necessity we lie under of proving at this time of day the first elements i will not say of christianity but even of natural light from reasons and from authorities the spirit of the times has rendered this unavoidable  if it should be asked after all how comes it then to pass that the fashionable and prevailing maxims among our betters in a neighboring nation should run directly counter to all such reasons and authorities i will answer this question by asking when were our neighbors known to abound to that degree in highwaymen murderers housebreakers incendiaries when did such numbers lay violent hands on themselves when was there such a general and indecent contempt of whatever is esteemed sacred in the state as well as the church when were there known among them such public frauds such open confederacies in villainy as the present age has produced when were they lower in esteem of mankind more divided at home or more insulted abroad  we of this land have a fatal tendency to overlook the good qualities and imitate whatever is amiss in those whom we respect this leads me to make some remarks on the modern spirit of reformation that works so strongly in both these kingdoms  freedom of thought is the general plea and cry of the age and we all grant that thinking is the way to know and the more real knowledge there is in the land the more likely it will be to thrive we are not therefore against freedom of thought but we are against those unthinking overbearing people it is not reason heartily proposed that offends but the reviling insulting ridiculing of the national laws and religion all this profits for freethinking and must needs be offensive to all reasonable men who in these odd times under that pretense set up for reformers and new molders of the constitution we declare against those who would seduce ignorant and unexperinced persons from the reverence they owe to the laws and religion of their country and under the notion of extirpating prejudices would erase from their minds all impressions of piety and virtue in order to introduce prejudices of another kind destructive of society  we esteem it a horrible thing to laugh at the apprehensions of a future state with the author of the charasterictics vol iii miscel iii c    or with him who wrote the fable of the bees to maintain that moral virtues are the political offspring which flattery begot upon pride inquiry into the origin of moral virtue ed   p     that in morals there is no greater certainty than in fashions of dress the authors remarks on his fable of the bees p      that indeed the doctrine of good manners teaches men to speak well of all virtues but requires no more of them in any age or country than the outward appearance of those in fashion remarks part ii p     two authors of infidel systems these who setting out upon opposite principles are calculated to draw all mankind by flattering either their vanity or their passions into one or other system and yet the people among whom such books are published wonder how it comes to pass that the civil magistrate daily loses his authority that the laws are trampled upon and the subject in constant fear of being robbed or murdered or having his house burnt over his head  it may be presumed that the science of finding fault which above all others is easiest to learn suits best with a modern education too many there are of better fortunes than understandings who have made the inquiry after truth a very small part of their care these see somewhat but not enough it were to be wished they knew either less or more one thing it is evident they do not know to wit that while they rail at prejudice they are undoing themselves they do not comprehend what has been before hinted that their whole figure their political existence is owing to certain vulgar prejudices in favor of birth title or fortune which add nothing of real worth either to mind or body and yet cause the most worthless person to be respected  feedom of thought is the prerogative of human kind it is a quality inherent in the very nature of a thinking being nothing is more evident than that every one can think his own way in spite of any outward force or power whatsoever it is therefore ridiculous for any man to declaim in defense of a privilege which cannot be denied or taken from him but this will not infer a boundless freedom of speech is there no difference between indulging scrupulous consciences and tolerating public deriders of all conscience and religion an open contempt of laws and a prescribing from private judgment a man who is himself permitted to follow his own private judgment cannot well complain although he may not set it up as a public rule against public authority things never borne in any wellordered state and which make the crying distemper of our times  the constitution of these kingdoms has been one while overheated by the indiscreet zeal of one set of men again it has been cold and lifeless through the indifference of another there is a medium in things which wise men find out while the unwise are always blundering in extremes we have alternately felt the furious effects of superstition and fanaticism and our present impending danger is from the setting up of private judgment or an inward light in opposition to human and divine laws such an inward conceited principle always at work and proceeding gradually and steadily may be sufficient to dissolve any human fabric of polity or civil government to pretend to be wiser than the laws has never been suffered in any wise state says aristotle rhet lib i cap    and indeed what wise state would encourage or endure a spirit of opposition reason modestly pleading from a conscientious principle has nothing cruel to apprehend from our laws and i hope it never will at the same time it must be allowed that every plea against law ought to be very meek and modest publicly to operate against its own decrees who can say to such a spirit thus far shall thou come and no farther  the magistrate perhaps may not be sufficiently aware that those pretended advocates for private light and free thought are in reality seditious men who set up themselves against national laws and constitutions and yet one would think all mankind might see that the spirit which prevails against the church and religion proceeds from an opposition rather to the laws of the land than to the gospel men quarrel not so vehemently against articles of faith themselves as against the establishing of such matters which is the sole effect of law and the supreme power it clearly follows the freedom pleaded for is not so much freedom of thought against the doctrines of the gospel as freedom of speech and action against the laws of the land it is strange that those who are not blind in other matters should yet not see this or that seeing it they should not discern the consequences thereof  i am sensible that whatever looks like a restraint on freedom of inquiry must be very disagreeable to all reasoning and inquisitive men but against this i have said nothing the profane and lawless scorner is one thing and the modest inquirer after truth another on the contrary i will freely own a judicious and impartial search after truth is the most valuable employment of the mind those who have the talents and will be at the pains cannot do better than engage in that noble pursuit but those who are not qualified by age or education those who have neither disposition nor leisure nor faculties to dig in the mine of truth themselves must take it as retailed out by others i see no remedy god who knows the opportunities of every man requires impossibilities from no man and where there is a sincere love of truth and virtue the grace of god can easily supply the defect of human means  it has been before observed and showed at large that the bulk of mankind must have their minds betimes imbued with good and wholesome notions or principles by their parents pastors and tutors or else bad notions hurtful to themselves and others will undoubtedly take possession thereof such bad notions have for several years past been propagated with uncommon industry in these kingdoms they now bring forth fruit every day more and more abundant it is to be feared that what has been long ripening is now near ripe many are the signs and tokens he that runs may read  but there cannot be a higher or more flagrant symptom of the madness of our times than that execrable fraternity of blasphemers lately set up within this city of dublin blasphemy against god is a great crime against the state but that a set of men should in open contempt of the laws make this very crime their profession distinguish themselves by a peculiar name blasters  and form a distinct society whereof the proper and avowed business shall be to shock all serious christians by the most impious and horrid blasphemies uttered in the most public manner this surely must alarm all thinking men it is a new thing under the sun reserved for our worthy times and country  it is no common blasphemy i speak of it is not simple cursing and swearing it is not the effect either of habit or surprise but a train of studied deliberate indignities against the divine majesty and those of so black and hellish a kind as the tongues alone which uttered them can duly characterize and express this is no speculative heresy no remote or doubtful inference from an authors tenets it is a direct and open attack on god himself it is such a calm premeditated insult upon religion law and the very light of nature that there is no sect or nation of men whether christians jews mahometans or even civilized heathens that would not be struck with horror and amazement at the thought of it and that would not animadvert they if there be any such who think to serve the reformation by joining with blasters and devilworshippers in a plea for license are in truth a scandal and reproach to the protestant cause on its authors with the utmost severity  deliberate atheistical blasphemy is of all crimes most dangerous to the public inasmuch as it opens the door to all other crimes and virtually contains them all a religious awe and fear of god being as we have already observed the center that unites and the cement that connects all human society he who makes it his business to lessen or root out from the minds of men this principle does in effect endeavor to fill his country with highwaymen housebreakers murderers fraudulent dealers perjured witnesses and every other pest of society therefore it would be the greatest cruelty to our children neighbors and country to connive at such a crime a crime which has no natural passion or temptation to plead for it but is the pure effect of an abandoned impudence in wickedness and perhaps of a mistaken hope that the laws and magistrates are asleep  the question is not now whether religion shall be established by law the thing is already done and done with good reason as appears from the premises but whether a reverence they who plead a right to contradict the laws can pretend none for doing it with insolence or disrespect for the laws shall be preserved religion considered as a system of saving truths has its sanction from heaven its rewards and penalties are divine but religion as useful and necessary to society has been wisely established by law and so established and wrought into the very frame and principles of our government is become a main part of the civil constitution our laws are the laws of a christian country our government has been constituted and modelled by christians and is still administered and maintained by men professing belief in christ can it then be supposed that impious men shall with impunity invent and to make the cause of such men the cause of liberty or toleration would be monstrous a man is not suffered publicly to blaspheme therefore he may not think freely a profane miscreant is not indulged in the public worship of the devil therefore a conscientious person may not serve god his own way is not this absurd publicly utter the most horrid blasphemies and at the same time the whole constitution not be endangered or can it be supposed that magistrates or men invested with power should look on and see the most sacred part of our constitution trampled under foot and yet imagine their own dignity and authority to be secure which rest entirely thereupon i will venture to say that whoever is a wise man and a lover of his country will not only be solicitous to preserve the honor of god sacred and entire he will even discourage that prevailing prejudice against the dispensers of gods word the teachers of those salutary doctrines without which the public cannot thrive or subsist he will be no contemner not even of those rites and ordinances enjoined by law as necessary to imprint and retain a sense of religion in the minds of men he will extend his care to the outworks as knowing that when these are gone it may be difficult to preserve the rest  notwithstanding the vain assertion of those men who would justify the present by saying all times are alike it is most evident that the magistrates the laws the very constitution of these realms have lost no small share of their authority and reverence since this great growth and spreading of impious principles whatever be the cause the effect is apparent whether we ascribe it to the natural course of things or to a just judgment upon those who having been careless to preserve a due sense of the divine authority have seen and shall see their own despised  darius a heathen prince made a decree that in every dominion of his kingdom men should tremble and fear before god dan chapter vi ver    nebuchadnezzar likewise another heathen made a decree that every people nation and language which spoke any thing amiss against god should be cut in pieces and their houses made a dunghill dan chapter iii ver    and if these things were done in persia and babylon surely it may be expected that impious blasphemers against god and his worship should at least be discouraged and put out of countenance in these christian countries now a constant course of disfavour from men in authority would prove a most effectual check to all such miscreants when therefore they are public and bold in their blasphemies this is no small reflection on those who might check them if they would  it is not so much the execution of the laws as the countenance of those in authority that is wanting to the maintenance of religion if men of rank and power who have a share in distributing justice and a voice in the public councils shall be observed to neglect divine worship themselves it must needs be a great temptation for others to do the same but if they and their families should set a good example it may be presumed that men of less figure would be disposed to follow it fashions are always observed to descend and people are generally fond of being in the fashion whence one would be apt to suspect the prevailing contempt of gods word and estrangement from his house to a degree that was never known in any christian country must take its rise from the irreligion and bad example of those who are styled the better sort  offenses must come but woe be to him by whom the offense comes a man who is entrusted with power and influence in his country has much to answer for if religion and virtue suffer through want of his authority and countenance but in case he should by the vanity of his discourse his favor to wicked men or his own apparent neglect of all religious duties countenance what he ought to condemn and authorize by his own example what he ought to punish such a one whatever he may pretend is in fact a bad patriot a bad citizen and a bad subject as well as a bad christian  our prospect is very terrible and the symptoms grow stronger every day the morals of a people are in this like their fortunes when they feel a national shock the worst does not show itself immediately things make a shift to subsist for a time on the credit of old notions and dying opinions but the youth born and brought up in wicked times without any bias to good from early principle or instilled opinion when they grow ripe must be monsters indeed and it is to be feared that age of monsters is not far off  whence this impietysprings by what means it gains ground among us and how it may be remedied are matters that deserve the attention of all those who have the power and the will to serve their country and although many things look like a prelude to some general ruin although it is much to be apprehended we shall be worse before we are better yet who knows what may ensue if all persons in power from the supreme executor of the law down to a petty constable would in their several stations behave themselves like men truly conscious and mindful that the authority they are clothed with is but a derivative ray from the supreme authority of heaven this may not a little contribute to stem that torrent which from small beginnings and under specious pretenses has grown to such a head and daily gathers force more and more to that degree as threatens a general inundation and destruction of these realms  a word to the wise or an exhortation to the roman catholic clergy of ireland  homo sum humani nihil a me alienum puto first printed in the year mdccxlix  a word to the wise be not startled reverend sirs to find yourselves addressed to by one of a different communion we are indeed to our shame be it spoken more inclined to hate for those articles wherein we differ than to love one another for those wherein we agree but if we cannot extinguish let us at least suspend our animosities and forgetting our religious feuds consider ourselves in the amiable light of countrymen and neighbors let us for once turn our eyes on those things in which we have one common interest why should disputes about faith interrupt the duties of civil life or the different roads we take to heaven prevent our taking the same steps on earth do we not inhabit the same spot of ground breathe the same air and live under the same government why then should we not conspire in one and the same design to promote the common good of our country  we are all agreed about the usefulness of meat drink and clothes and without doubt we all sincerely wish our poor neighbors were better supplied with them providence and nature have done their part no country is better qualified to furnish the necessaries of life and yet no people are worse provided in vain is the earth fertile and the climate benign if human labor be wanting nature supplies the materials which art and industry improve to the use of man and it is the want of this industry that occasions all our other wants  the public has endeavored to excite and encourage this useful virtue much has been done but whether it be from the heaviness of the climate or from the spanish or scythian blood that runs in their veins or whatever else may be the cause there still remains in the natives of this island a remarkable antipathy to labor you gentlemen can alone conquer their innate hereditary sloth do you then as you love your country exert yourselves  you are known to have great influence on the minds of your people be so good as to use this influence for their benefit since other methods fail try what you can do be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort   timothy chapter iv ver   make them thoroughly sensible of the sin and folly of sloth show your charity in clothing the naked and feeding the hungry which you may do by the mere breath of your mouths give me leave to tell you that no set of men upon earth have it in their power to do good on easier terms with more advantage to others and less pains or loss to themselves your flocks are of all others most disposed to follow directions and of all others want them most and indeed what do they not want  the house of an irish peasant is the cave of poverty within you see a pot and a little straw without a heap of children tumbling on the dunghill their fields and gardens are a lively counterpart of solomons description in the proverbs i went says that wise king by the field of the slothful and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding and lo it was all grown over with thorns and nettles had covered the face thereof and the stone wall thereof was broken down prove chapter xxiv ver  0     in every road the ragged ensigns of poverty are displayed you often meet caravans of poor whole families in a drove without clothes to cover or bread to feed them both which might be easily procured by moderate labor they are encouraged in this vagabond life by the miserable hospitality they meet with in every cottage whose inhabitants expect the same kind reception in their turn when they become beggars themselves beggary being the last refuge of these improvident creatures  if i seem to go out of my province or to prescribe to those who must be supposed to know their own business or to paint the lower inhabitants of this land in no very pleasing colors you will heartily forgive a well meant zeal which obliges me to say things rather useful than agreeable and to lay open the sore in order to heal it  but whatever is said must be so taken as not to reflect on persons of rank and education who are no way inferior to their neighbors nor yet to include all even of the lowest sort though it may well extend to the generality of those especially in the western and southern parts of the kingdom where the british manners have less prevailed we take our notions from what we see mine are a faithful transcript from originals about me  the scythians were noted for wandering and the spaniards for sloth and pride our irish are behind neither of these nations from which they descend in their respective characteristics better is he that labors and abounds in all things than he that boasts himself and wants bread says the son of sirach chapter x ver     but so says not the irishman in my own family a kitchenwench refused to carry out cinders because she was descended from an old irish stock never was there a more monstrous conjunction than that of pride with beggary and yet this prodigy is seen every day in almost every part of this kingdom at the same time these proud people are more destitute than savages and more abject than negroes the negroes in our plantations have a saying if negro was not negro irishman would be negro and it may be affirmed with truth that the very savages of america are better clad and better lodged than the irish cottagers throughout the fine fertile counties of limerick and tipperary  having long observed and bewailed this wretched state of my countrymen and the insufficiency of several methods set on foot to reclaim them i have recourse to your reverences as the dernier resort make them to understand that you have their interest at heart that you persuade them to work for their own sakes and that god has ordered matters so as that they who will not work for themselves must work for others the terrors of debt slavery and famine should one would think drive the most slothful to labor make them sensible of these things and that the ends of providence and order of the world require industry in human creatures man goes forth to his work and to his labor until the evening says the psalmist when he is describing the beauty order and perfection of the works of god psalm civ ver    but what says the slothful person yet a little sleep a little slumber a little folding of the hands to sleep prove chapter vi ver  0  but what says the wiseman so shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth and thy want as an armed man prove chapter vi ver      all nature will furnish you with arguments and examples against sloth go to the ant thou sluggard cries solomon the ant the be the beetle and every insect but the drone reads a lesson of industry to man but the shortest and most effectual lesson is that of saint paul if any man will not work neither should he eat   thessalonians chapter iii ver  0  this command was injoined the thessalonians and equally respects all christians and indeed all mankind it being evident by the light of nature that the whole creation works together for good and that no part was designed to be useless as therefore the idle man is of no use it follows that he has no right to a subsistence let them work says the apostle and eat their own bread   thessalonians chapter iii ver     not bread got by begging not bread earned by the sweat of other men but their own bread that which is got by their own labor then shall thou eat the labor of thine hands says the psalmist to which he adds happy shall thou be and it shall be well with thee psalm cxxxviii ver    intimating that to work and enjoy the fruits thereof is a great blessing  a slothful mans imagination is apt to dress up labor in a horrible mask but horrible as it is idleness is more to be dreaded and a life of poverty its necessary consequence is far more painful it was the advice of pythagoras to choose the best kind of life for that use would render it agreeable reconciling men even to the roughest exercise by practice pains become at first easy and in the progress pleasant and this is so true that whoever examines things will find there can be no such thing as a happy life without labor and that whoever does not labor with his hands must in his own defense labor with his brains  certainly planting and tilling the earth is an exercise not less pleasing than useful it takes the peasant from his smoky cabin into the fresh air and the open field rendering his lot far more desirable than that of the sluggard who lies in the straw or sits whole days by the fire  convince your people that not only pleasure invites but necessity also drives them to labor if you have any compassion for these poor creatures put them in mind how many of them perished in a late memorable distress through want of that provident care against a hard season observable not only in all other men but even in irrational animals set before their eyes in lively colors their own indigent and sordid lives compared with those of other people whose industry has procured them hearty food warm clothes and decent dwellings make them sensible what a reproach it is that a nation which makes so great pretensions to antiquity and is said to have flourished many ages ago in arts and learning should in these our days turn out a lazy destitute and degenerate race  raise your voices reverend sirs exert your influence show your authority over the multitude by engaging them to the practice of an honest industry a duty necessary to all and required in all whether protestants or roman catholics whether christians jews or pagans be so good among other points to find room for this than which none is of more concern to the souls and bodies of your hearers nor consequently deserves to be more amply or frequently insisted on  many and obvious are the motives that recommend this duty upon a subject so copious you can never be at a loss for something to say and while by these means you rescue your countrymen from want and misery you will have the satisfaction to behold your country itself improved what pleasure must it give you to see these waste and wild scenes these naked ditches and miserable hovels exchanged for fine plantations rich meadows welltilled fields and neat dwellings to see people well fed and well clad instead of famished ragged scarecrows and those very persons tilling the fields that used to beg in the streets  neither ought the difficulty of the enterprise to frighten you from attempting it it must be confessed a habit of industry is not at once introduced neighbor nevertheless will emulate neighbor and the contagion of good example will spread as surely as of bad though perhaps not so speedily it may be hoped there are many that would be allured by a plentiful and decent manner of life to take pains especially when they observe it to be attained by the industry of their neighbors in no sort better qualified than themselves  if the same gentle spirit of sloth did not sooth our squires as well as peasants one would imagine there should be no idle hands among us alas how many incentives to industry offer themselves in this island crying aloud to the inhabitants for work roads to be repaired rivers made navigable fisheries on the coasts mines to be wrought plantations to be raised manufactures improved and above all lands to be tilled and sowed with all sorts of grain  when so many circumstances provoke and animate your people to labor when their private wants and the necessities of the public when the laws the magistrates and the very country calls upon them you cannot think it becomes you alone to be silent or hindmost in every project for promoting the public good why should you whose influence is greatest be least active why should you whose words are most likely to prevail say least in the common cause  perhaps it will be said the discouragements attending those of your communion are a bar against all endeavors for exciting them to a laudable industry men are stirred up to labor by the prospect of bettering their fortunes by getting estates or employments but those who are limited in the purchase of estates and excluded from all civil employments are deprived of those spurs to industry  to this it may be answered that admitting these considerations do in some measure damp industry and ambition in persons of a certain rank yet they can be no let to the industry of poor people or supply an argument against endeavoring to procure meat drink and clothes it is not proposed that you sold persuade the better sort to acquire estates or qualify themselves for becoming magistrates but only that you should set the lowest of the people at work to provide themselves with necessaries and supply the wants of nature  it will be alleged in excuse of their idleness that the country people want encouragement to labor as not having a property in the lands there is small encouragement say you for them to build or plant upon anothers land wherein they have only a temporary interest to which i answer that life itself is but temporary that all tenures are not of the same kind that the case of our english and the original irish is equal in this respect and that the true aborigines or natural irish are noted for want of industry in improving even on their own lands whereof they have both possession and property  how many industrious persons are there in all civilized countries without any property in lands or any prospect of estates or employments industry never fails to reward her votaries there is no one but can earn a little and little added to little makes a heap in this fertile and plentiful island none can perish for want but the idle and improvident none who have industry frugality and foresight but may get into tolerable if not wealthy circumstances are not all trades and manufactures open to those of your communion have you not the same free use and may you not make the same advantage of fairs and markets as other men do you pay higher duties or are you liable to greater impositions than your fellow subjects and are not the public praemiums and encouragements given indifferently to artists of all communions have not in fact those of your communion a very great share of the commerce of this kingdom in their hands and is not more to be got by this than by purchasing estates or possessing civil employments whose incomes are often attended with large expenses  a tight house warm apparel and wholesome food are sufficient motives to labor if all had them we should be a flourishing nation and if those who take pains may have them those who will not take pains are not to be pitied they are to be looked on and treated as drones the pest and disgrace of society  it will be said the hardness of the landlord cramps the industry of the tenant but if rent be high and the landlord rigorous there is more need of industry in the tenant it is well known that in holland taxes are much higher and rent both of land and houses far dearer than in ireland but this is no objection or impediment to the industry of the people who are rather animated and spurred on to earn a livelihood by labor that is not to be got without it  you will say it is an easy matter to make a plausible discourle on industry and its advantages but what can be expected from poor creatures who are destitute of all conveniences for exerting their industry who have nothing to improve upon nothing to begin the world with i answer they have their four quarters and five senses is it nothing to possess the bodily organs found and entire that wonderful machine the hand was it formed to be idle  was there but will to work there are not wanting in this island either opportunities or encouragements spinning alone might employ all idle hands children as well as parents being soon learned easily performed and never failing of a market requiring neither wit nor strength but suited to all ages and capacities the public provides utensils and persons for teaching the use of them but the public cannot provide a heart and will to be industrious these i will not deny may be found in several persons in some other parts of the kingdom and wherever they are found the comfortable effects show themselves but seldom very seldom are they found in these southern peeple whose indolence figureth a lion in the way and is proof against all encouargement  but you will insist how can a poor man whose daily labor goes for the payment of his rent be able to provide present necessaries for his family much less to lay up a store for the future it must be owned a considerable share of the poor mans time and labor goes toward paying his rent but how are his wife and children employed or how does he employ himself the rest of his time the same work tires but different works relieve where there is a true spirit of industry there will never be wanting something to do without doors or within by candlelight if not by daylight labor ipse voluptas says the poet and this is verified in fact  in england when the labor of the field is over it is usual for men to betake themselves to some other labor of a different kind in the northern parts of that industrious land the inhabitants meet a jolly crew at one anothers houses where they merrily and frugally pass the long and dark winter evenings several families by the same light and the same fire working at their different manufactures of wool flax or hemp company mean while mutually cheering and provoking to labor in certain other e g newportpagnel in buckinghamshire parts you may see on a summers evening the common laborers sitting along the street of a town or village each at his own door with a cushion before him making bonelace and earning more in an evenings pastime than an irish family would in a whole day those people instead of closing the day with a game on greasy cards or lying stretched before the fire pass their time much more cheerfully in some useful employment which custom has rendered light and agreeable  but admitting for the various reasons above alleged that it is impossible for our cottagers to be rich yet it is certain they may be clean now bring them to be cleanly and your work is half done a little washing scrubbing and rubbing bestowed on their persons and houses would introduce a sort of industry and industry in any one kind is apt to beget it in another  indolence in dirt is a terrible symptom which shows itself in our lower lrish more perhaps than in any people on this side the cape of good hope i will venture to add that look throughout the kingdom and you shall not find a clean house inhabited by clean people and yet wanting necessaries the same spirit of industry that keeps folk clean being sufficient to keep them also in food and raiment  but alas our poor irish are wedded to dirt upon principle it is with some them a maxim that the way to make children thrive is to keep them dirty and i do verily believe that the familiarity with dirt contracted and nourished from their infancy is one great cause of that sloth which attends them in every stage of life were children but brought up in an abhorrence of dirt and obliged to keep themselves clean they would have something to do whereas now they do nothing  it is past all doubt that those who are educated in a supine neglect of all things either profitable or decent must needs contract a sleepiness and indolence which does necessarily lead to poverty and every other distress that attends it love not sleep cries solomon lest thou come to poverty open thine eyes and thou shall be satisfied with bread prove chapter xx ver     it is therefore greatly to be wished that you would persuade parents to inure their children betimes to a habit of industry as the surest way to shun the miseries that must otherwise befall them  an early habit whether of sloth or diligence will not fail to show itself throughout the whole course of a mans life train up a child says the wiseman in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it prove chapter xxii ver    the first tincture often leaves so deep a stain as no afterthought or endeavor can wash out hence sloth in some minds is proof against all arguments and examples whatsoever all motives of interest and duty all impressions even of cold and hunger this habit rooted in the child grows up and adheres to the man producing a general listlessness and aversion from labor this i take to be our great calamity  for admitting that some of our squires and landlords are vultures with iron bowels and that their hardness and severity is a great discouragement to the tenant who will naturally prefer want and ease before want and toil it must at the same time be admitted that neither is the landlord generally speaking so hard nor the climate so severe nor the soil so ungrateful as not to answer the husbandmans labor where there is a spirit of industry the want of which is the true cause of our national distress of this there are many evident proofs  i have myself known a man from the lowest condition of life without friends or education not knowing so much as to write or read bred to no trade or calling by pure dint of daylabour frugality and foresight to have grown wealthy even in this island and under all the abovementioned disadvantages and what is done by one is possible to another  in holland a child five years old is maintained by its own labor in ireland many children of twice that age do nothing but steal or incumber the hearth and dunghill this shameful neglect of education shows itself through the whole course of their lives in a matchless sloth bred in the very bone and not to be accounted for by any outward hardship or discouragement whatever it is the native color if we may so speak and complexion of the people dutch english french or flemish cannot match them  mark an irishman at work in the field if a coach or horseman go by he is sure to suspend his labor and stand staring until they are out of sight a neighbor of mine made it his remark in a journey from london to bristol that all the laborers of whom he enquired the road constantly answered without looking up or interrupting their work except one who stood staring and leaning on his spade and him he found to be an irishman  it is a shameful thing and peculiar to this nation to see lusty vagabonds strolling about the country and begging without any pretense to beg ask them why they do not labor to earn their own livelihood they will tell you they want employment offer to employ them and they shall refuse your offer or if you get them to work one day you may be sure not to see them the next i have known them tdecline even the lighrest labor that of haymaking having at the same time neither clothes for their backs nor food for their bellies  a sore leg is an estate to such a fellow and this may be easily got and continued with small trouble such is their laziness that rather than work they will cherish a distemper this i know to be true having seen more than one instance wherein the second nature so far prevailed over the first that sloth was preferred to health to these beggars who make much of their sores and prolong their diseases you cannot do a more thankless office than cure them except it be to shave their beards which conciliate a sort of reverence to that order of men  it is indeed a difficult task to reclaim such fellows from their slothful and brutal manner of life to which they seem wedded with an attachment that no temporal motives can conquer nor is there humanly speaking any hopes they will mend except their respect for your lessons and fear of something beyond the grave be able to work a change in them  certainly if i may advise you should in return for the lenity and indulgence of the government endeavor to make yourselves useful to the public and this will best be performed by rousing your poor countrymen from their beloved sloth i shall not now dispute the truth or importance of other points but will venture to say that you may still find time to inculcate this doctrine of an honest industry and that this would by no means be time thrown away if promoting your countrys interest and rescuing so many unhappy wretches of your communion from beggary or the gallows be thought worth your pains  it should seem you cannot in your sermons do better than inveigh against idleness that extensive parent of many miseries and many sins idleness the mother of hunger and sister of theft idleness which the son of sirach assures us teaches many vices  the same doctrine is often preached from the gallows and indeed the poverty nakedness and famine which idleness entaileth on her votaries do make men so wretched that they may well think it better to die than to live such lives hence a courage for all villainous undertakings which bringing men to a shameful death do then open their eyes when they are going to be closed for ever  if you have any regard as it is not to be doubted either for the souls or bodies of your people or even for your own interest and credit you cannot fail to inveigh against this crying sin of your country seeing you are obnoxious to the laws should you not in prudence try to reconcile yourselves to the favor of the public and can you do this more effectually than by cooperating with the public spirit of the legislature and men in power  were this but done heartily would you but be instant in season and out of season reprove rebuke exhort   timothy chapter iv ver    such is the ascendent you have gained over the people that we might soon expect to see the good effects thereof we might hope that our garners would be soon full affording all manner of store that our sheep would bring forth thousands that our oxen would be strong to labor that there would be no breaking in nor going out no robbery nor migration nor bread and that there would be no complaining in our streets psalm cxliv ver         it stands you upon to act with vigor in this cause and shake off the shackles of sloth from your countrymen the rather because there be some who surmise that yourselves have put them on right or wrong men will be apt to judge of your doctrines by their fruits it will reflect small honor on their teachers if instead of honesty and industry those of your communion are peculiarly distinguished by the contrary qualities or if the nation converted by the great and glorious saint patrick should above ail other nations be stigmatized and marked out as good for nothing  i can never suppose you so much your own enemies as to be friends to this odious sloth but were this once abolished and a laudable industry introduced in its stead it may perhaps be asked who are to be gainers i answer your reverences are like to be great gainers for every penny you now gain you will gain a shilling you would gain also in your credit and your lives would be more comfortable  you need not be told how hard it is to take from rags and penury a tolerable subsistence or how offensive to perform the duties of your function amidst stench and nastiness or how much things would change for the better in proportion to the industry and wealth of your flocks duty as well as interest calls upon you to clothe the naked and feed the hungry by persuading them to eat in the apostles phrase their own bread or as the psalmist expresses it the labor of their own hands by inspiring your flocks with a love of industry you will at once strike at the root of many vices and dispose them to practice many virtues this therefore is the readiest way to improve them  consult your superiors they shall tell you the doctrine here delivered is a sound catholic doctrine not limited to protestants but extending to all and admitted by all whether protestants or roman catholics christians or mahometans jews or gentiles and as it is of the greatest extent so it is also of the highest importance saint paul expressly says that if any provide not for his own and especially for those of his own house he has denied the faith and is worse than an infidel   timothy chapter v ver     in vain then do you endeavor to make men orthodox in points of faith if at the same time in the eyes of christ and his apostles you suffer them to be worse than infidels than those who have no faith at all there is something it seems worse than even infidelity and to incite and stimulate you to put away that cursed thing from among you is the design and aim of this address the doctrine we recommend is an evident branch of the law of nature it was taught by prophets inculcated by apostles encouraged and enforced by philosophers legislators and all wise states in all ages and in all parts of the world let me therefore entreat you to exert yourselves to be instant in season and out of season rebuke reprove exhort take all opportunities to drive the lion out of the way raise your voices omit no occasion public or private of awakening your wretched countrymen from their sweet dream of sloth  many suspect your religion to be the cause of that notorious idleness which prevails so generally among the natives of this island as if the roman catholic faith was inconsistent with an honest diligence in a mans calling but whoever considers the great spirit of industry that reigns in flanders and france and even beyond the alps must acknowledge this to be a groundless suspicion in piedmont and genoa in the milanese and the venetian state and indeed throughout all lombardy how well is the soil cultivated and what manufactures of silk velvet paper and other commodities flourish the king of sardinia will suffer no idle hands in his territories no beggar to live by the sweat of anothers brow it has even been made penal at turin to relieve a strolling beggar to which i might add that the person whose authority will be of the greatest weight with you even the pope himself is at this day endeavoring to put new life into the trade and manufactures of his country  though i am in no secret of the court of rome yet i will venture to affirm that neither pope nor cardinals will be pleased to hear that those of their communion are distinguished above all others by sloth dirt and beggary or be displeased at your endeavoring to rescue them from the reproach of such an infamous distinction  the case is as clear as the sun what we urge is enforced by every motive that can work on a reasonable mind the good of your country your own private interest the duty of your function the cries and distresses of the poor do with one voice call for your assistance and if it is on all hands allowed to be right and just if agreeable both to reason and religion if coincident with the views both of your temporal and spiritual superiors it is to be hoped this address may find a favorable reception and that a zeal for disputed points will not hinder your concurring to propagate so plain and useful a doctrine wherein we are all agreed  when a leak is to be stopped or a fire extinguished do not all hands cooperate without distinction of sect or party or if i am fallen into a ditch shall i not suffer a man to help me out until i have first examined his creed or when i am sick shall i refuse the physic because my physician does or does not believe the popes supremacy  fas est et ab host doceri but in truth i am no enemy to your persons whatever i may think of your tenets on the contrary i am your sincere wellwisher i consider you as my countrymen as fellow subjects as professing belief in the same christ and i do most sincerely wish there was no other contest between us but who shall most completely practice the precepts of him by whose name we are called and whose disciples we all profess to be  soon after the preceding address was published the printer hereof received the following letter from the roman catholic clergy of the diocese of dublin desiring it to be inserted in the dublin journal of november         you will very much oblige many of your constant readers if you acquaint the public that the address you lately published entitled a word to the wise or an exhortation to the roman catholic clergy of ireland was received by the roman catholic clergy of dublin with the highest sense of gratitude and they take the liberty in this public manner to return their sincere and hearty thanks to the worthy author assuring him that they are determined to comply with every particular recommended in it to the utmost of their power in every page it contains a proof of the authors extensive charity his views are only toward the public good the means he prescribes are easily complied with and his manner of treating persons in their circumstances so very singular that they plainly show the good man the polite gentleman and the true patriot all this has so great an effect upon them that they have already directed circular letters to the parish priests of this diocese recommending in the most earnest manner the perusal and zealous execution of what is contained in the said address and it is hoped that by publishing this in your journal the roman catholic clergy of the other parts of this kingdom will be induced to follow their example which must promote the laudable views of that great and good man at the same time he may be assured that the roman catholic clergy of this city have frequently taken considerable pains to recommend to their respective flocks industry and a due application to their different trades and callings as an indispensible duty and the means of avoiding the many vices and bad consequences which generally attend criminal poverty and want but the more effectually to prevent these evils and remove all excuses for sloth and idleness they have several months ago pursuant to the example of many bishoprics in lombardy spain naples etc taken the steps most proper and expedient in their opinion to lessen considerably the number of holidays in this kingdom and they make no doubt but their expectations will in a short time be fully answered to the great advantage of the public  we are etc  a letter to the roman catholics of the diocese of cloyne published in the late rebellion a d mdcixlv my countrymen and fellow subjects notwithstanding the differences of our religious opinions i should be sorry to be wanting in any instance of humanity or good neighborhood to any of you for which reason i find myself strongly inclined at this critical juncture to put you in mind that you have been treated with a truly christian lenity under the present government that your persons have been protected and your properties secured by equal laws and that it would be highly imprudent as well as ungrateful to forfeit these advantages by making yourselves tools to the ambition of foreign princes who fancy it expedient to raise disturbances among us at present but as soon as their own ends are served will not fail to abandon you as they have always done  is it not evident that your true interest consists in lying still and waiting the event since ireland must necessarily follow the fate of england and that therefore prudence and policy prescribe quiet to the roman catholics of this kingdom who in case a change of hands should not succeed after your attempting to bring it about must then expect to be on a worse foot than ever  but we will suppose it succeeds to your wish what then would not this undermine even your own interests and fortune which are often interwoven with those of your neighbors would not all those who have debts or money or other effects in the hands of protestants be fellow sufferers with them would not all those who hold under the acts of settlement be as liable as protestants themselves to be dispossessed by the old proprietors or can even those who are styled proprietors flatter themselves with hopes of possessing the estates which they claim which in all likelihood would be given to favorites perhaps to foreigners who are near the person or who fought the battles of their master  under protestant governments those of your communion have formerly enjoyed a greater share of the lands of this kingdom and more ample privileges you bore your part in the magistracy and the legislature and could complain of no hardships on the score of your religion if these advantages have been since impaired or lost was it not by the wrong measures yourselves took to enlarge them in several successive attempts each of which left you weaker and in a worse condition than you were before and this notwithstanding the vaunted succors of france and spain whose vain efforts in conjunction with yours constantly recoiled on your own heads even when your numbers and circumstances were far more considerable than they now are  you all know these things to be true i appeal to your own breasts dear bought experience has taught you and past times instruct the present but perhaps you follow conscience rather than interest will any men amongst you pretend to plead conscience against being quiet or against paying allegiance and peaceable submission to a protestant prince which the first christians paid even to heathen and which those of your communion at this day pay to mohammedan and to idolatrous princes in turkey and china and which you yourselves have so often professed to pay to our present gracious sovereign conscience is quite out of the case and what man in his senses would engage in a dangerous course to which neither interest does invite nor conscience oblige him  i heartily wish that this advice may be as well taken as it is meant and that you may maturely consider your true interest rather than rashly repeat the same errors which you have so often repented of so recommending you to the merciful guidance of almighty god i subscribe myself  your real wellwisher george cloyne  maxims concerning patriotism first published a d mdccl   every man by consulting his own heart may easily know whether he is or is not a patriot but it is not so easy for the bystanders    being loud and vehement either against a court or for a court is no proof of patriotism    a man whose passion for money runs high bids fair for being no patriot and he likewise whose appetite is keen for power    a native than a foreigner a married man than a bachelor a believer than an infidel have a better chance for being patriots    it is impossible an epicure should be a patriot    it is impossible a man who cheats at cards or cogs the dice should be a patriot    it is impossible a man who is false to his friends and neighbors should be true to the public    every

0 a sot a beast benumbed and stupefied by excess is good for nothing much less to make a patriot of     a fop or man of pleasure makes but a scurvy patriot     a sullen churlish man who loves no body will hardly love his country     the love of praise and esteem may do something but to make a true patriot there must be an inward sense of duty and conscience     honesty like other things grows from its proper seed good principles early laid in the mind     to be a real patriot a man must consider his countrymen as gods creatures and himself as accountable for his acting toward them     if pro

advertisement by the author the querist was first printed in the year one thousand seven hundred and thirtyfive since which time the face of things is somewhat changed in this edition some alterations have been made the three parts are published in one some few queries are added and many omitted particularly of those relating to the sketch or plan of a national bank which it may be time enough to take again in hand when the public shall seem disposed to make use of such an expedient i had determined with myself never to prefix my name to the querist but in the last edition was overruled by a friend who was remarkable for pursuing the publics interest with as much diligence as others do their own i apprehend the same censure on this that i incurred upon another occasion for meddling out of my profession though to feed the hungry and clothe the naked by promoting an honest industry will perhaps be deemed no improper employment for a clergyman who still thinks himself a member of the commonwealth as the sum of human happiness is supposed to consist in the goods of mind body and fortune i would fain make my studies of some use to mankind with regard to each of these three particulars and hope it will not be thought faulty or indecent in any man of what profession soever to offer his mite toward improving the manners health and prosperity of his fellow creatures  the querist qu   whether there ever was is or will be an industrious nation poor or an idle rich    whether a people can be called poor where the common sort are well fed clothed and lodged    whether the drift and aim of every wise state should not be to encourage industry in its members and whether those who employ neither heads nor hands for the common benefit deserve not to be expelled like drones out of a well governed state    whether the four elements and mans labor therein be not the true source of wealth    whether money be not only so far useful as it stirs up industry enabling men mutually to participate the fruits of each others labor    whether any other means equally conducing to excite and circulate the industry of mankind may not be as useful as money    whether the real end and aim of men be not power and whether he who could have every thing else at his wish or will would value money    whether the public aim in every well governed state be not that each member according to his just pretensions and industry should have power    whether power be not referred to action and whether action does not follow appetite or will   0 whether fashion does not create appetites and whether the prevailing will of a nation is not the fashion     whether the current of industry and commerce be not determined by this prevailing will     whether it be not owing to custom that the fashions are agreeable     whether it may not concern the wisdom of the legislature to interpose in the making of fashions and not leave an affair of so great influence to the management of women and fops tailors and vintners     whether reasonable fashions are a greater restraint on freedom than those which are unreasonable     whether a general good taste in a people would not greatly conduce to their thriving and whether an uneducated gentry be not the greatest of national evils     whether customs and fashions do not supply the place of reason in the vulgar of all ranks whether therefore it does not very much import that they should be wisely framed     whether the imitating those neighbors in our fashions to whom we bear no likeness in our circumstances be not one cause of distress to this nation     whether frugal fashions in the upper rank and comfortable living in the lower be not the means to multiply inhabitants     whether the bulk of our irish natives are not kept from thriving by that cynical content in dirt and beggary which they possess to a degree beyond any other people in christendom   0 whether the creating of wants be not the likeliest way to produce industry in a people and whether if our peasants were accustomed to eat beef and wear shoes they would not be more industrious     whether other things being given as climate soil etc the wealth be not proportioned to the industry and this to the circulation of credit be the credit circulated or transferred by what marks or tokens soever     whether therefore less money swiftly circulating be not in effect equivalent to more money slowly circulating or whether if the circulation be reciprocally as the quantity of coin the nation can be a loser     whether money is to be considered as having an intrinsic value or as being a commodity a standard a measure or a pledge as is variously suggested by writers and whether the true idea of money as such be not altogether that of a ticket or counter     whether the value or price of things be not a compounded proportion directly as the demand and reciprocally as the plenty     whether the terms crown livre pound sterling etc are not to be considered as exponents or denominations of such proportion and whether gold silver and paper are not tickets or counters for reckoning recording and transferring thereof     whether the denominations being retained although the bullion were gone things might not nevertheless be rated bought and sold industry promoted and a circulation of commerce maintained     whether an equal raising of all sorts of gold silver and copper coin can have any effect in bringing money into the kingdom and whether altering the proportions between the several sorts can have any other effect but multiplying one kind and lessening another without any increase of the sum total     whether arbitrary changing the denomination of coin be not a public cheat     what makes a wealthy people whether mines of gold and silver are capable of doing this and whether the negroes amidst the gold sands of afric are not poor and destitute   0 whether there be any virtue in gold or silver other than as they set people at work or create industry     whether it be not the opinion or will of the people exciting them to industry that truly enricheth a nation and whether this does not principally depend on the means for counting transferring and preserving power that is property of all kinds     whether if there was no silver or gold in the kingdom our trade might not nevertheless supply bills of exchange sufficient to answer the demands of absentees in england or elsewhere     whether current banknotes may not be deemed money and whether they are not actually the greater part

command the industry of others be not real wealth and whether money be not in truth tickets or tokens for conveying and recording such power and whether it be of great consequence what materials the tickets are made of     whether trade either foreign or domestic be in truth any more than this commerce of industry     whether to promote transfer and secure this commerce and this property in human labor or in other words this power be not the sole means of enriching a people and how far this may be done independently of gold and silver     whether it were not wrong to suppose land itself to be wealth and whether the industry of the people is not first to be considered as that which constitutes wealth which makes even land and silver to be wealth neither of which would have any value but as means and motives to industry     whether in the wastes of america a man might not possess twenty miles square of land and yet want his dinner or a coat to his back   0 whether a fertile land and the industry of its inhabitants would not prove inexhaustible funds of real wealth be the counters for conveying and recording thereof what you will paper gold or silver     whether a single hint be sufficient to overcome a prejudice and whether even obvious truths will not sometimes bear repeating     whether if human labor be the true source of wealth it does not follow that idleness should of all things be discouraged in a wise state     whether even gold or silver if they should lessen the industry of its inhabitants would not be ruinous to a country and whether spain be not an instance of this     whether the opinion of men and their industry consequent thereupon be not the true wealth of holland and not the silver supposed to be deposited in the bank at amsterdam     whether there is in truth any such treasure lying dead and whether it be of great consequence to the public that it should be real rather than notional     whether in order to understand the true nature of wealth and commerce it would not be right to consider a ships crew cast upon a desert island and by degrees forming themselves to business and civil life while industry begot credit and credit moved to industry     whether such men would not all set themselves to work whether they would not subsist by the mutual participation of each others industry whether when one man had in his way procured more than he could consume he would not exchange his superfluities to supply his wants whether this must not produce credit whether to facilitate these conveyances to record and circulate this credit they would not soon agree on certain tallies tokens tickets or counters     whether reflection in the better sort might not soon remedy our evils and whether our real defect be not in a wrong way of thinking     whether it would not be an unhappy turn in our gentlemen if they should take more thought to create an interest to themselves in this or that county or borough than to promote the real interest of their country   0 whether if a man builds a house he does not in the first place provide a plan which governs his work and shall the public act without an end a view a plan     whether by how much the less particular folk think for themselves the public be not so much the more obliged to think for them     whether small gains be not the way to great profit and if our tradesmen are beggars whether they may not thank themselves for it     whether some way might not be found for making criminals useful in public works instead of sending them either to america or to the other world     whether we may not as well as other nations contrive employment for them and whether servitude chains and hard labor for a term of years would not be a more discouraging as well as a more adequate punishment for felons than even death itself     whether there are not such things in holland as bettering houses for bringing young gentlemen to order and whether such an institution would be useless among us     whether it be true that the poor in holland have no resource but their own labor and yet there are no beggars in their streets     whether he whose luxury consumes foreign products and whose industry produces nothing domestic to exchange for them is not so far forth injurious to his country     whether necessity is not to be hearkened to before convenience and convenience before luxury     whether to provide plentifully for the poor be not feeding the root the substance whereof will shoot upwards into the branches and cause the top to flourish   0 whether there be any instance of a state wherein the people living neatly and plentifully did not aspire to wealth     whether nastiness and beggary do not on the contrary extinguish all such ambition making men listless hopeless and slothful     whether a country inhabited by people well fed clothed and lodged would not become every day more populous and whether a numerous stock of people in such circumstances would not constitute a flourishing nation and how far the product of our own country may suffice for the compassing of this end     whether a people who had provided themselves with the necessaries of life in good plenty would not soon extend their industry to new arts and new branches of commerce     whether those same manufactures which england imports from other countries may not be admitted from ireland and if so whether lace carpets and tapestry three considerable articles of english importation might not find encouragement in ireland and whether an academy for design might not greatly conduce to the perfecting those manufactures among us     whether france and flanders could have drawn so much money from england for figured silks lice and tapestry if they had not had academies for designing     whether when a room was once prepared and models in plaster of paris the annual expense of such an academy need stand the public in above two hundred pounds a year     whether our linenmanufacture would not find the benefit of this institution and whether there be any thing that makes us fall short of the dutch in damasks diapers and printed linen but our ignorance in design     whether those who may slight this affair as notional have sufficiently considered the extensive use of the art of design and its influence in most trades and manufactures wherein the forms of things are often more regarded than the materials since the first publication of this query the art of design seems to be more considered and countenanced among us      whether there be any art sooner learned than that of making carpets and whether our women with little time and pains may not make more beautiful carpets than those imported from turkey and whether this branch of the woollenmanufacture be not open to us   0 whether human industry can produce from such cheap materials a manufacture of so great value by any other art as by those of sculpture and painting     whether pictures and statues are not in fact so much treasure and whether rome and florence would not be poor towns without them     whether they do not bring ready money as well as jewels whether in italy debts are not paid and children portioned with them as with gold and silver     whether it would not be more prudent to strike out and exert ourselves in permitted branches of trade than to fold our hands and repine that we are not allowed the woollen     whether it be true that two millions are yearly expended by england by foreign lace and linen     whether immense sums are not drawn yearly into the northern countries for supplying the british navy with hempen manufactures     whether there be any thing more profitable than hemp and whether there should not be great praemiums for encouraging our hempen trade what advantages may not great britain make of a country where land and labor are so cheap     whether ireland alone might not raise hemp sufficient for the british navy and whether it would not be vain to expect this from the british colonies in america where hands are so scarce and labor so excessively dear     whether if our our own people want will or capacity for such an attempt it might not be worth while for some undertaking spirits in england to make settlements and raise hemp in the counties of clare and limerick than which perhaps there is not fitter land in the world for that purpose and whether both nations would not find their advantage therein     whether if all the idle hands in this kingdom were employed on hemp and flax we might not find sufficient vent for these manufactures   0 how far it may be in our own power to better our affairs without interfering with our neighbors     whether the prohibition of our woollentrade ought not naturally to put us on other methods which give no jealousy     whether paper be not a valuable article of commerce and whether it be not true that one single bookseller in london yearly expended above four thousand pounds in that foreign commodity     how it comes to pass that the venetians and genoese who wear so much less linen and so much worse than we do should yet make very good paper and in great quantity while we make very little     how long it will be before my countrymen find out that it is worth while to spend a penny in order to get a groat     if all the land were tilled that is fit for tillage and all that sowed with hemp and flax that is fit for raising them whether we should have much sheepwalk beyond what was sufficient to supply the necessities of the kingdom     whether other countries have not flourished without the woollentrade     whether it be not a sure sign or effect of a countrys thriving to see it well cultivated and full of inhabitants and if so whether a great quantity of sheepwalk be not ruinous to a country rendering it waste and thinly inhabited     whether the employing so much of our land under sheep be not in fact an irish blunder     whether our hankering after our woollentrade be not the true and only reason which has created a jealousy in england toward ireland and whether any thing can hurt us more than such jealousy   0 whether it be not the true interest of both nations to become one people and whether either be sufficiently apprized of this     whether the upper part of this people are not truly english by blood language religion manners inclination and interest     whether we are not as much englishmen as the children of old romans born in britain were still romans     whether it be not our true interest not to interfere with them and in every other case whether it be not their true interest to befriend us     whether a mint in ireland might not be of great convenience to the kingdom and whether it could be attended with any possible inconvenience to great britain and whether there were not mints in naples and in sicily when those kingdoms were provinces to spain or the house of austria     whether any thing can be more ridiculous than for the north of ireland to be jealous of a linenmanufacture in the south     whether the county of tipperary be not much better land than the county of armagh and yet whether the latter is not much better improved and inhabited than the former     whether every landlord in the kingdom does not know the cause of this and yet how few are the better for such their knowledge     whether large farms under few hands or small ones under many are likely to be made most of and whether flax and tillage do not naturally multiply hands and divide land into small holdings and wellimproved     whether as our exports are lessened we ought not to lessen our imports and whether these will not be lessened as our demands and these as our wants and these as our customs or fashions of how great consequence therefore are fashions to the public   00 whether it would not be more reasonable to mend our state than to complain of it and how far this may be in our own power   0  what the nation gains by those who live in ireland upon the produce of foreign countries   0  how far the vanity of our ladies in dressing and of our gentlemen in drinking contributes to the general misery of the people   0  whether nations as wife and opulent as ours have not made sumptuary laws and what hinders us from doing the same   0  whether those who drink foreign liquors and deck themselves and their families with foreign ornaments are not so far forth to be reckoned absentees   0  whether as our trade is limited we ought not to limit our expenses and whether this be not the natural and obvious remedy   0  whether the dirt and famine and nakedness of the bulk of our people might not be remedied even although we had no foreign trade and whether this should not be our first care and whether if this were once provided for the conveniences of the rich would not soon follow   0  whether comfortable living does not produce wants and wants industry and industry wealth   0  whether there is not a great difference between holland and ireland and whether foreign commerce without which the one could not subsist be so necessary for the other   0  might we not put a hand to the plough or the spade although we had no foreign commerce    0 whether the exigencies of nature are not to be answered by industry on our own soil and how far the conveniences and comforts of life may be procured by a domestic commerce between the several parts of this kingdom      whether the women may not few spin weave embroider sufficiently for the embellishment of their persons and even enough to raise envy in each other without being beholden to foreign countries      suppose the bulk of our inhabitants had shoes to their feet clothes to their backs and beef in their bellies

their own country      whether a nation within itself might not have real wealth sufficient to give its inhabitants power and distinction without the help of gold and silver      whether if the arts of sculpture and painting were encouraged among us we might not furnish our houses in a much nobler manner with our own manufactures      whether we have not or may not have all the necessary materials for building at home      whether tiles and plaster may not supply the place of norway fir for flooring and wainscot      whether plaster be not warmer as well as more secure than deal and whether a modern fashionable house lined with fir daubed over with oil and paint be not like a fireship ready to be lighted up by all accidents      whether larger houses better built and furnished a greater train of servants the difference with regard to equipage and table between finer and coarser more and less elegant may not be sufficient to feed a reasonable share of vanity or support all proper distinctions and whether all these may not be procured by domestic industry out of the four elements without ransacking the four quarters of the globe    0 whether any thing is a nobler ornament in the eye of the world than an italian palace that is stone and mortar skilfully put together and adorned with sculpture and painting and whether this may not be compassed without foreign trade      whether an expense in gardens and plantations would not be an elegant distinction for the rich a domestic magnificence employing many hands within and drawing nothing from abroad      whether the apology which is made for foreign luxury in england to wit that they could not carry on their trade without imports as well as exports will hold in ireland      whether one may not be allowed to conceive and suppose a society or nation of human creatures clad in woollen cloths and stuffs eating good bread beef and mutton poultry and fish in great plenty drinking ale mead and cider inhabiting decent houses built of brick and marble taking their pleasure in fair parks and gardens depending on no foreign imports either for food or raiment and whether such people ought much to be pitied      whether ireland be not as well qualified for such a state as any nation under the sun      whether in such a state the inhabitants may not contrive to pass the twentyfour hours with tolerable ease and cheerfulness and whether any people upon earth can do more      whether they may not eat drink play dress visit sleep in good beds fit by good fires build plant raise a name make estates and spend them      whether upon the whole a domestic trade may not suffice in such a country as ireland to nourish and clothe its inhabitants and provide them with the reasonable conveniences and even comforts of life      whether a general habit of living well would not produce numbers and industry and whether considering the tendency of human kind the consequence thereof would not be foreign trade and riches how unnecessary soever      whether nevertheless it be a crime to enquire how far we may do without foreign trade and what would follow on such a supposition    0 whether the number and welfare of the subjects be not the true strength of the crown      whether in all public institutions there should not be an end proposed which is to be the rule and limit of the means

were employed in this manufacture      whether a foreigner could imagine that one half of the people were starving in a country which sent out such plenty of provisions      whether an irish lady set out with french silks and flanders lace may not be said to consume more beef and butter than a hundred of our laboring peasants      whether nine tenths of our foreign trade be not carried on singly to support the article of vanity      whether it can be hoped that private persons will not indulge this folly unless restrained by the public      how vanity is maintained in other countries whether in hungary for instance a proud nobility are not subsisted with small imports from abroad      whether there be a prouder people upon earth than the noble venetians although they all wear plain black

england for discouraging french wines which may not hold with respect to us also      how much of the necessary sustenance of our people is yearly exported for brandy      whether if people must poison themselves they had not better do it with their own growth      if we imported neither claret from france nor fir from norway what the nation would save by it      when the root yields insufficient nourishment whether men do not top the tree to make the lower branches thrive      whether if our ladies drank sage or baum tea out of irish ware it would be an insupportable national calamity    0 whether it be really true that such wine is best as most encourages drinking i e that must be given in the largest dose to produce its effect and whether this holds with regard to any other medicine      whether that trade should not be accounted most pernicious wherein the balance is most against us and whether this be not the trade with france      whether it be not even madness

great plenty and variety of excellent wines are not to be had on the coasts of italy and sicily and whether those countries would not take our commodities of linen leather butter etc in exchange for them      particularly whether the vinum mamertinum which grows on the mountains about messina a red generous wine highly esteemed if we may credit pliny by the ancient romans would not come cheap and please the palates of our islanders      why if a bribe by the palate or the purse be in effect the same thing they should not be alike infamous      whether the vanity and luxury of a few ought to stand in competition with the interest of a nation      whether national wants ought not to be the rule of trade and whether the most pressing wants of the majority ought not to be first considered

least it may not be worth while to consider what branches thereof deserve to be entertained and how far we may be able to carry it on under our present limitations      what foreign imports may be

manufactures rather than provisions and of those such as employ most hands      whether she would not be a very vile matron and justly thought either mad or foolish that should give away the necessaries of life from her naked and famished children in exchange for pearls to stick in her hair and sweet meats to please her own palate      whether a nation might not be considered as a family

london is not to be considered as the metropolis of ireland and whether our wealth such as it is does not circulate through london and throughout all england as freely as that of any part of his

supplying of churches in our foreign plantations and for converting the savage americans to christianity by a college to be erected in the summer islands otherwise called the isles of bermuda  the harvest truly is great but the laborers are few luke x   first printed in london a d mdccxxv  a proposal for the better supplying of churches in our foreign plantations etc although there are several excellent persons of the church of england whose good intentions and endeavors have not been wanting to propagate the gospel in foreign parts who have even combined into societies for that very purpose and given great encouragement not only for english missionaries in the west indies but also for the reformed of other nations led by their example to propagate christianity in the east it is nevertheless acknowledged that there is at this day but little sense of religion and a most notorious corruption of manners in the english colonies settled on the continent of america and the islands it is also acknowledged that the gospel has hitherto made but a very inconsiderable progress among the neighboring americans who still continue in much the same ignorance and barbarism in which we found them above a hundred years ago  i shall therefore venture to submit my thoughts upon a point that i have long considered to better judgments in hopes that any expedient will be favorably hearkened to which is proposed for the remedy of these evils now in order to effect this it should seem the natural proper method to provide in the first place a constant supply of worthy clergymen for the english churches in those parts and in the second place a like constant supply of zealous missionaries well fitted for propagating christianity among the savages  for though the surest means to reform the morals and soften the behavior of men be to preach to them the pure incorrupt doctrine of the gospel yet it cannot be denied that the success of preaching depends in good measure on the character and skill of the preacher forasmuch as mankind are more apt to copy characters than to practice precepts and forasmuch as argument to attain its full strength does not less require the life of zeal than the weight of reason and the same doctrine which makes great impression when delivered with decency and address loses very much of its force by passing through awkward or unskilful hands  now the clergy sent over to america have proved too many of them very meanly qualified both in learning and morals for the discharge of their office and indeed little can be expected from the example or instruction of those who quit their native country on no other motive than that they are not able to procure a livelihood in it which is known to be often the case  to this may be imputed the small care that has been taken to convert the negroes of our plantations who to the infamy of england and scandal of the world continue heathen under christian masters and in christian countries which could never be if our planters were rightly instructed and made sensible that they disappointed their own baptism by denying it to those who belong to them that it would be of advantage to their affairs to have slaves who should obey in all things their masters according to the flesh not with eyeservice as menpleasers but in singleness of heart as fearing god that gospel liberty consists with temporal servitude and that their slaves would only become better slaves by being christians  and though it be allowed that some of the clergy in our colonies have approved themselves men of merit it will at the same time be allowed that the most zealous and able missionary from england must find himself but ill qualified for converting the american heathen if we consider the difference of language their wild way of living and above all the great jealousy and prejudice which savage nations have toward foreigners or innovations introduced by them  these considerations make it evident that a college or seminary in those parts is very much wanted and therefore the providing such a seminary is earnestly proposed and recommended to all those who have it in their power to contribute to so good a work by this two ends would be obtained  first the youth of our english plantations might be themselves fitted for the ministry and men of merit would be then glad to fill the churches of their native country which are now a drain for the very dregs and refuse of ours  at present there are i am told many churches vacant in our plantations and many very ill supplied nor can all the vigilance and wisdom of that great prelate whose peculiar care it is prevent this so long as the aforesaid churches are supplied from england  and supplied they must be with such as can be picked up in england or ireland until a nursery of learning for the education of the natives is founded this indeed might provide a constant succession of learned and exemplary pastors and what effect this must be supposed to have on their flocks i need not say  secondly the children of savage americans brought up in such a seminary and well instructed in religion and learning might make the ablest and properest missionaries for spreading the gospel among their countrymen who would be less apt to suspect and readier to embrace a doctrine recommended by neighbors or relations men of their own blood and language than if it were proposed by foreigners who would not improbably be thought to have designs on the liberty or property of their converts  the young americans necessary for this purpose may in the beginning be procured either by peaceable methods from those savage nations which border on our colonies and are in friendship with us or by taking captive the children of our enemies  it is proposed to admit into the aforesaid college only such savages as are under ten years of age before evil habits have taken a deep root and yet not so early as to prevent retaining their mother tongue which should be preserved by intercourse among themselves  it is further proposed to ground these young americans thoroughly in religion and morality and to give them a good tincture of other learning particularly of eloquence history and practical mathematics to which it may not be improper to add some skill in physic  if there were a yearly supply of ten or a dozen such missionaries sent abroad into their respective countries after they had received the degree of master of arts in the aforesaid college and holy orders in england till such time as episcopacy be established in those parts it is hardly to be doubted but in a little time the world would see good and great effects thereof  for to any considering man the employing american missionaries for the conversion of america will of all others appear the most likely method to succeed especially if care be taken that during the whole course of their education an eye should be had to their mission that they should be taught betimes to consider themselves as trained up in that sole view without any other prospect of provision or employment that a zeal for religion and love of their country should be early and constantly instilled into their minds by repeated lectures and admonitions that they should not only be incited by the common topics of religion and nature but farther animated and inflamed by the great examples in past ages of public spirit and virtue to rescue their countrymen from their savage manners to a life of civility and religion  if his majesty would graciously please to grant a charter for a college to be erected in a proper place for these uses it is to be hoped a fund may be soon raised by the contribution of well disposed persons sufficient for building and endowing the same for as the necessary expense would be small so there are men of religion and humanity in england who would be pleased to see any design set forward for the glory of god and the good of mankind  a small expense would suffice to subsist and educate the american missionaries in a plain simple manner such as might make it easy for them to return to the coarse and poor methods of life in use among their countrymen and nothing can contribute more to lessen this expense than a judicious choice of the situation where the seminary is to stand  many things ought to be considered in the choice of a situation it should be in a good air in a place where provisions are cheap and plenty where an intercourse might easily be kept up with all parts of america and the islands in a place of security not exposed to the insults of pirates savages or other enemies where there is no great trade which might tempt the readers or fellows of the college to become merchants to the neglect of their proper business where there are neither riches nor luxury to divert or lessen their application or to make them uneasy and dissatisfied with a homely frugal subsistence lastly where the inhabitants if such a place may be found are noted for innocence and simplicity of manners i need not say of how great importance this point would be toward forming the morals of young students and what mighty influence it must have on the mission  it is evident the college long since projected in barbados would be defective in many of these particulars for though it may have its use among the inhabitants yet a place of so high trade so much wealth and luxury and such dissolute morals not to mention the great price and scarcity of provisions must at first sight seem a very improper situation for a general seminary intended for the forming missionaries and educating youth in religion and sobriety of manners the same objections lie against the neighboring islands  and if we consider the accounts given of their avarice and licentiousness their coldness in the practice of religion and their aversion from propagating it which appears in the withholding their slaves from baptism it is to be feared that the inhabitants in the populous parts of our plantations on the continent are not much fitter than those in the islands abovementioned to influence or assist such a design and as to the more remote and less frequented parts the difficulty of being supplied with necessaries the danger of being exposed to the inroads of savages and above all the want of intercourse with other places render them improper situations for a seminary of religion and learning  it will not be amiss to insert here an observation i remember to have seen in an abstract of the proceedings etc annexed to the dean of canterburys sermon before the society for the propagation of the gospel in foreign parts that the savage indians who live on the continent will not suffer their children to learn english or dutch lest they should be debauched by conversing with their european neighbors which is a melancholy but strong confirmation of the truth of what has been now advanced  a general intercourse and correspondence with all the english colonies both on the islands and the continent and with other parts of america has been before laid down as a necessary circumstance the reason whereof is very evident but this circumstance is hardly to be found for on the continent where there are neither inns nor carriages nor bridges over the rivers there is no traveling by land between distant places and the english settlements are reputed to extend along the seacoast for the space of fifteen hundred miles it is therefore plain there can be no convenient communication between them otherwise than by sea no advantage therefore in this point can be gained by settling on the continent  there is another consideration which equally regards the continent and islands that the general course of trade and correspondence lies from all those colonies to great britain alone whereas for our present purpose it would be necessary to pitch upon a place if such could be found which maintains a constant intercourse with all the other colonies and whose commerce lies chiefly or altogether not in europe but in america  there is but one spot that i can find to which this circumstance agrees and that is the isles of bermuda otherwise called the summer islands these having no rich commodity or manufacture such as sugar tobacco or the like wherewithal to trade to england are obliged to become carriers for america as the dutch are for europe the bermudans are excellent shipwrights and sailors and have a great number of very good sloops which are always passing and repassing from all parts of america they drive a constant trade to the islands of jamaica barbados antego etc with butter onions cabbages and other roots and vegetables which they have in great plenty and perfection they have also some small manufactures of joiners work and matting which they export to the plantations on the continent hence bermudan sloops are oftener seen in the ports of america than any other and indeed by the best information i could get it appears they are the only people of all the british plantations who hold a general correspondence with the rest  and as the commerce of bermuda renders it a very fit place wherein to erect a seminary so likewise does its situation it being placed between our plantations on the continent and those in the isles so as equally to respect both to which may be added that it lies in the way of vessels passing from america to great britain all which makes it plain that the youth to be educated in a seminary placed in the summer islands would have frequent opportunities of going thither and corresponding with their friends it must indeed be owned that some will be obliged to go a long way to any one place which we suppose resorted to from all parts of our plantations but if we were to look out a spot the nearest approaching to an equal distance from all the rest i believe it would be found to be bermuda it remains that we see whether it enjoys the other qualities or conditions laid down as well as this  the summer islands are situated near the latitude of thirty three degrees no part of the world enjoys a purer air or a more temperate climate the great ocean which environs them at once moderating the heat of the south winds and the severity of the northwest such a latitude on the continent might be thought too hot but the air in bermuda is perpetually fanned and kept cool by seabreezes which render the weather the most healthy and delightful that could be wished being as is affirmed by persons who have long lived there of one equal tenor almost throughout the whole year like the latter end of a fine may insomuch that it is resorted to as the montpellier of america  nor are these isles if we may believe the accounts given of them less remarkable for plenty than for health there being besides beef mutton and fowl great abundance of fruits and gardenstuff of all kinds in perfection to this if we add the great plenty and variety of fish which is every day taken on their coasts it would seem that a seminary could no where be supplied with better provisions or cheaper than here  about forty years ago upon cutting down many tall cedars that sheltered their orange trees from the northwest wind which sometimes blows even there so as to affect that delicate plant great part of their orange plantations suffered but other cedars are since grown up and no doubt a little industry would again produce as great plenty of oranges as ever was there heretofore i mention this because some have inferred from the present scarcity of that fruit for which bermuda was once so famous that there has been a change in the soil and climate for the worse but this as has been observed proceeded from another cause which is now in great measure taken away  bermuda is a cluster of small islands which lie in a very narrow compass containing in all not quite twenty thousand acres this groupe of isles is to use mr wallers expression walled round with rocks which render them inaccessible to pirates or enemies there being but two narrow entrances both well guarded by forts it would therefore be impossible to find any where a more secure retreat for students  the trade of bermuda consists only in gardenstuff and some poor manufactures principally of cedar and the palmettoleaf bermuda hats are worn by our ladies they are made of a sort of mat or as they call it platting made of the palmettoleaf which is the only commodity that i can find exported from bermuda to great britain and as there is no prospect of making a fortune by this small trade so it cannot be supposed to tempt the fellows of the college to engage in it to the neglect of their peculiar business which might possibly be the case elsewhere  such as their trade is such is their wealth the inhabitants being much poorer than the other colonies who do not fail to despise them upon that account but if they have less wealth they have withal less vice and expensive folly than their neighbors they are represented as a contented plain innocent sort of people free from avarice and luxury as well as the other corruptions that attend those vices  i am also informed that they are more constant attendants on divine service more kind and respectful to their pastor when they have one and show much more humanity to their slaves and charity to one another than is observed among the english in the other plantations one reason of this may be that condemned criminals being employed in the manufactures of sugar and tobacco were never transported thither but whatever be the cause the facts are attested by a clergyman of good credit who lived long among them  among a people of this character and in a situation thus circumstantiated it would seem that a seminary of religion and learning might very fitly be placed the correspondence with other parts of america the goodness of the air the plenty and security of the place the frugality and innocence of the inhabitants all conspiring to favor such a design thus much at least is evident that young students would be there less liable to be corrupted in their morals and the governing part would be easier and better contented with a small stipend and a retired academical life in a corner from whence avarice and luxury are excluded than they can be supposed to be in the midst of a full trade and great riches attended with all that high living and parade which our planters affect and which as well as all fashionable vices should be far removed from the eyes of the young american missionaries who are to lead a life of poverty and selfdenial among their countrymen  after all it must be acknowledged that though every thing else should concur with our wishes yet if a set of good governors and teachers be wanting who are acquainted with the methods of education and have the zeal and ability requisite for carrying on a design of this nature it would certainly come to nothing  an institution of this kind should be set on foot by men of prudence spirit and zeal as well as competent learning who should be led to it by other motives than the necessity of picking up a maintenance for upon this view what man of merit can be supposed to quit his native country and take up with a poor college subsistence in another part of the world where there are so many considerable parishes actually void and so many others ill supplied for want of fitting incumbents is it likely that fellowships of fifty or sixty pounds a year should tempt abler or worthier men than benefices of many times their value  and except able and worthy men do first engage in this affair with a resolution to exert themselves in forming the manners of the youth and giving them a proper education it is evident the mission and the college will be but in a very bad way this inconvenience seems the most difficult to provide against and if not provided against it will be the most likely to obstruct any design of this nature so true it is that where ignorance or ill manners once take place in a seminary they are sure to be handed down in a succession of illiterate or worthless men  but this apprehension which seems so well grounded that a college in any part of america would either lie unprovided or be worse provided than their churches are has no place in bermuda there being at this time several gentlemen in all respects very well qualified and in possession of good preferments and fair prospects at home who having seriously considered the great benefit that may arise to the church and to mankind from such an undertaking are ready to engage in it and to dedicate the remainder of their lives to the instructing the youth of america and prosecuting their own studies upon a very moderate subsistence in a retirement so sweet and so secure and every way so well fitted for a place of education and study as bermuda  thus much the writer hereof thought himself obliged to say of his associates for himself he can only say that as he values no preferment upon earth so much as that of being employed in the execution of this design so he hopes to make up for other defects by the sincerity of his endeavors  in europe the protestant religion has of late years considerably lost ground and america seems the likeliest place wherein to make up for what has been lost in europe provided the proper methods are taken otherwise the spanish missionaries in the south and the french in the north are making such a progress as may one day spread the religion of rome and with it the usual hatred to protestants throughout all the savage nations in america which would probably end in the utter extirpation of our colonies on the safety whereof depends so much of the nations wealth and so considerable a branch of his majestys revenue  but if this scheme were pursued it would in all probability have much greater influence on the americans than the utmost endeavors of popish emissaries can possibly have who from the difference of country language and interest must lie under far greater difficulties and discouragements than those whom we suppose yearly sent out from bermuda to preach among their countrymen  it cannot indeed be denied that the great number of poor regulars inured to hard living and brought up in an implicit obedience to their superiors has hitherto given the church of rome in regard to her missions great advantage over the reformed churches but from what has been said it is i think evident that this advantage may be overbalanced by our employing american missionaries  nor is the honor of the crown nation and church of england unconcerned in this scheme which it is to be hoped will remove the reproach we have so long lain under that we fall as far short of our neighbors of the romish communion in zeal for propagating religion as we surpass them in the soundness and purity of it and at the same time that the doing what may be so easily done takes away our reproach it will cast no small luster on his majestys reign and derive a blessing from heaven on his administration and those who live under the influence thereof  men of narrow minds have a peculiar talent at objection being never at a loss for something to say against whatsoever is not of their own proposing and perhaps it will be said in opposition to this proposal that if we thought ourselves capable of gaining converts to the church we ought to begin with infidels papists and dissenters of all denominations at home and to make proselytes of these before we think of foreigners and that therefore our scheme is against duty and further that considering the great opposition which is found on the part of those who differ from us at home no success can be expected among savages abroad and that therefore it is against reason and experience  in answer to this i say that religion like light is imparted without being diminished that whatever is done abroad can be no hindrance or let to the conversion of infidels or others at home that those who engage in this affair imagine they will not be missed where there is no want of schools or clergy but that they may be of singular service in countries but thinly supplied with either or altogether deprived of both that our colonies being of the same blood language and religion with ourselves are in effect our countrymen but that christian charity not being limited by those regards does extend to all mankind and this may serve for an answer to the first point that our design is against duty  to the second point i answer that ignorance is not so incurable as error that you must pull down as well as build erase as well as imprint in order to make proselytes at home whereas the savage americans if they are in a state purely natural and unimproved by education they are also unincumbred with all that rubbish of superstition and prejudice which is the effect of a wrong one as they are less instructed they are withal less conceited and more teachable and not being violently attached to any false system of their own are so much the fitter to receive that which is true hence it is evident that success abroad ought not to be measured by that which we observe at home and that the inference which was made from the difficulty of the one to the impossibility of the other is altogether groundless  it has more the appearance of reason to object what will possibly be objected by some that this scheme has been already tried to no purpose several indians having returned to their savage manners after they had been taught to write and read and instructed in the christian religion a clear proof that their natural stupidity is not to be overcome by education  in answer to this i say that the scheme now proposed has never been tried forasmuch as a thorough education in religion and morality in divine and human learning does not appear to have been ever given to any savage american that much is to be hoped from a man ripe in years and well grounded in religion and useful knowledge while little or nothing can be expected from a youth but slightly instructed in the elements of either that from the miscarriage or gross stupidity of some a general incapacity of all americans cannot be fairly inferred that they show as much natural sense as other uncultivated nations that the empires of mexico and peru were evident proofs of their capacity in which there appeared a reach of politics and a degree of art and politeness which no european people were ever known to have arrived at without the use of letters or of iron and which some perhaps have fallen short of with both those advantages  to what has been said it may not be improper to add that young americans educated in an island at some distance from their own country will more easily be kept under discipline till they have attained a complete education than on the continent where they might find opportunities of running away to their countrymen and returning to their brutal customs before they were thoroughly imbued with good principles and habits  it must nevertheless be acknowledged a difficult attempt to plant religion among the americans so long as they continue their wild and roving life he who is obliged to hunt for his daily food will have little curiosity or leisure to receive instruction it would seem therefore the right way to introduce religion and civil life at the same time into that part of the world either attempt will assist and promote the other those therefore of the young savages who upon trial are found less likely to improve by academical studies may be taught agriculture or the most necessary trades and when husbandmen weavers carpenters and the like have planted those useful arts among their savage countrymen and taught them to live in settled habitations to canton out their land and till it to provide vegetable food of all kinds to preserve flocks and herds of cattle to make convenient houses and to clothe themselves decently this will assist the spreading the gospel among them this will dispose them to social virtues and enable them to see and to feel the advantages of a religious and civil education  and that this view of propagating the gospel and civil life among the savage nations of america was a principal motive which induced the crown to send the first english colonies thither does appear from the charter granted by king james i to the adventurers in virginia see purchas s pilgrims vol   b i c   and it is now but just what might then seem charitable that these poor creatures should receive some advantage with respect to their spiritual interests from those who have so much improved their temporal by settling among them  it is most true notwithstanding our present corruptions that there are to be found in no country under the sun men of better inclinations or greater abilities for doing good than in england but it is as true that success in many cases depends not upon zeal industry wealth learning or the like faculties so much as on the method wherein these are applied we often see a small proportion of labor and expense in one way bring that about which in others a much greater share of both could never effect it has been my endeavor to discover this way or method in the present case what has been done i submit to the judgment of all good and reasonable men who i am persuaded will never reject or discourage a proposal of this nature on the score of slight objections surmises or difficulties and thereby render themselves chargeable with the having prevented those good effects which might otherwise have been produced by it  for it is after all possible that unforeseen difficulties may arise in the prosecution of this design many things may retard and many things may threaten to obstruct it but there is hardly any enterprise or scheme whatsoever for the public good in which difficulties are not often showing themselves and as often overcome by the blessing of god upon the prudence and resolution of the undertakers though for ought that appears the present scheme is as likely to succeed and attended with as few difficulties as any of this kind can possibly be  for to any man who considers the divine power of religion the innate force of reason and virtue and the mighty effects often wrought by the constant regular operation even of a weak and small cause it will seem natural and reasonable to suppose that rivulets perpetually issuing forth from a fountain or reservoir of learning and religion and streaming through all parts of america must in due time have a great effect in purging away the ill manners and irreligion of our colonies as well as the blindness and barbarity of the nations round them especially if the reservoir be in a clean and private place where its waters out of the way of any thing that may corrupt them remain clear and pure otherwise they are more likely to pollute than purify the places through which they flow  the greatness of a benefaction is rather in proportion to the number and want of the receivers than to the liberality of the giver a wise and good man would therefore be frugal in the management of his charity that is contrive it so as that it might extend to the greatest wants of the greatest number of his fellow creatures now the greatest wants are spiritual wants and by all accounts these are no where greater than in our western plantations in many parts whereof divine service is never performed for want of clergymen in others after such a manner and by such hands as scandalize even the worst of their own parishioners where many english instead of gaining converts are themselves degenerated into heathens being members of no church without morals without faith without baptism there can be therefore in no part of the christian world a greater want of spiritual things than in our plantations  and on the other hand no part of the gentile world are so inhuman and barbarous as the savage americans whose chief employment and delight consisting in cruelty and revenge their lives must of all others be most opposite as well to the light of nature as to the spirit of the gospel now to reclaim these poor wretches to prevent the many torments and cruel deaths which they daily inflict on each other to contribute in any sort to put a stop to the numberless horrid crimes which they commit without remorse and instead thereof to introduce the practice of virtue and piety must surely be a work in the highest degree becoming every sincere and charitable christian  those who wish well to religion and mankind will need no other motive to forward an undertaking calculated for the service of both i shall nevertheless beg leave to observe that whoever would be glad to cover a multitude of sins by an extensive and welljudged charity or whoever from an excellent and godlike temper of mind seeks opportunities of doing good in his generation will be pleased to meet with a scheme that so peculiarly puts it in his power with small trouble or expense to procure a great and lasting benefit to the world  ten pounds a year would if i mistake not be sufficient to defray the expense of a young american in the college of bermuda as to diet lodging clothes books and education and if so the interest of two hundred pounds may be a perpetual fund for maintaining one missionary at the college for ever and in this succession many it is to be hoped may become powerful instruments for converting to christianity and civil life whole nations who now sit in darkness and the shadow of death and whose cruel brutal manners are a disgrace to human nature  a benefaction of this kind seems to enlarge the very being of a man extending it to distant places and to future times inasmuch as unseen countries and after ages may feel the effects of his bounty while he himself reaps the reward in the blessed society of all those who having turned many to righteousness shine as the stars for ever end ever  p s since the foregoing proposal was first made public his majesty has been graciously pleased to grant a charter for erecting a college by the name of st pauls college in bermuda for the uses abovementioned which college is to contain a president and nine fellows the first president appointed by charter is george berkeley d d and dean of derry the three fellows named in the charter are william thompson jonathan rogers and james king masters of arts and fellows of trinity college near dublin the nomination of a president is reserved to the crown the election of fellows is vested in the president and the majority of the fellows as is likewise the government of the society the lord bishop of london for the time being is appointed visitor and such of his majestys principal secretaries of state for the time being as has america in his province is appointed chancellor of the said college the president and fellows have the power of making statutes to be approved by the visitor they have also the power of conferring degrees in all faculties they are obliged to maintain and educate indian scholars at the rate of ten pound per annum for each they are obliged to transmit annual accounts of the state of the college number of students their progress etc to the chancellor and visitor the aforesaid president and fellows are licensed to hold their preferments in these kingdoms till one year and a half be expired after their arrival in bermuda this society is incorporated with the usual clauses has power to receive benefactions purchase lands keep a common seal etc lastly all in office under his majesty are required to be aiding and assisting to the protection and preservation thereof  a sermon preached before the incorporated society for the propagation of the gospel in foreign parts at their anniversary meeting in the parish church of st marylebow on friday february          first printed in london a d mdccxxxii  february           at the anniversary meeting of the society for the propagation of the gospel in foreign parts agreed that the thanks of the society be given to the reverend mr dean berkeley for his sermon preached this day before the society and that he be desired to print the same  david humphreys secretary  john xvii   this is life eternal that they may know thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou have sent that human kind were not designed merely to sojourn a few days upon this earth that a being of such excellence as the soul of man so capable of a nobler life and having such a high sense of things moral and intellectual was not created in the sole view of being imprisoned in an earthly tabernacle and partaking a few pains and pleasures which checker this mortal life without aspiring to any thing either above or beyond it is a fundamental doctrine as well of natural religion as of the christian it comes at once recommended by the authority of philosophers and evangelists and that there actually is in the mind of man a strong instinct and desire an appetite and tendency toward another and a better state incomparably superior to the present both in point of happiness and duration is no more than every ones experience and inward feeling may inform him the satiety and disrelish attending sensual enjoyments the relish for things of a more pure and spiritual kind the restless motion of the mind from one terrene object or pursuit to another and often a flight or endeavor above them all toward something unknown and perfective of its nature are so many signs and tokens of this better state which in the style of the gospel is termed life eternal  and as this is the greatest good that can befall us the very end of our being and that alone which can crown and satisfy our wishes and without which we shall be ever restless and uneasy so every man who knows and acts up to his true interest must make it his principal care and study to obtain it and in order to this he must endeavor to live suitably to his calling and of consequence endeavor to make others obtain it too for how can a christian show himself worthy of his calling otherwise than by performing the duties of it and what christian duty is more essentially so than that of charity and what object can be found upon earth more deserving our charity than the souls of men or how is it possible for the most beneficent spirit to do them better service than by promoting their best and most lasting interest that is by putting them in the way that leads to eternal life  what this eternal life was or how to come at it were points unknown to the heathen world it must be owned the wise men of old who followed the light of nature saw even by that light that the soul of man was debased and borne downwards contrary to its natural bent by carnal and terrene objects and that on the other hand it was exalted purged and in some sort assimulated to the deity by the contemplation of truth and practice of virtue thus much in general they saw or surmised but then about the way and means to know the one or perform the other they were much at a loss they were not agreed concerning the true end of mankind which as they saw was mistaken in the vulgar pursuits of men so they found it much more eafy to consute the errors of others than to ascertain the truth themselves hence so many divisions and disputes about a point which it most imported them to know insomuch as it was to give the bias to human life and govern the whole tenor of their actions and conduct  but when life and immortality were brought to light by the gospel there could remain no dispute about the chief end and felicity of man no more than there could about the means of obtaining it after the express declaration of our blessed lord in the words of my text this is life eternal that they may know thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou have sent for the right understanding of which words we must observe that by the knowledge of god is not meant a barren speculation either of philosophers or scholastic divines nor any notional tenets fitted to produce disputes and dissensions among men but on the contrary an holy practical knowledge which is the source the root or principle of peace and union of faith hope charity and universal obedience a man may frame the most accurate notions and in one sense attain the exactest knowledge of god and christ that human faculties can reach and yet notwithstanding all this be far from knowing them in that saving sense for st john tells us that   john iii   whosoever sins has not seen christ nor known him and again   john iv   he that loves not knows not god to know god as we ought we must love him and love him so as withal to love our brethren his creatures and his children i say that knowledge of god and christ which is life eternal implies universal charity with all the duties ingrafted thereon or ensuing from thence that is to say the love of god and man and our lord expressly says john xiv    he that has my commandments and keeps them he it is that loves me from all which it is evident that this saving knowledge of god is inseparable from the knowledge and practice of his will the explicit declaration whereof and of the means to perform it are contained in the gospel that divine instrument of grace and mercy to the sons of men the metaphysical knowledge of god considered in his absolute nature or essence is one thing and to know him as he stands related to us as creator redeemer and sanctifier is another the former kind of knowledge whatever it amounts to has been and may be in gentiles as well as christians but not the latter which is life eternal  from what has been said it is a plain consequence that whoever is a sincere christian cannot be indifferent about bringing over other men to the knowledge of god and christ but that every one of us who has any claim to that title is indispensably obliged in duty to god and in charity to his neighbor to desire and promote so far as there is opportunity the conversion of heathens and infidels that so they may become partakers of life and immortality for this is life eternal to know thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou have sent  in my present discourse upon which words i shall  first consider in general the obligation that christians lie under of bringing other men to the knowledge of the only true god and of jesus christ and  secondly i shall consider it in reference to this laudable society instituted for the propagation of the gospel and under each head i propose to obviate such difficulties as may seem to retard and intermix such remarks as shall appear proper to forward so good a work  now although it be very evident that we can really have neither a just zeal for the glory of god nor a beneficent love of man without wishing and endeavoring as occasion serves to spread the glad tidings of salvation and bring those who are benighted in the shadow of death to life eternal by the knowledge of the only true god and of jesus christ whom he has sent yet this duty plain and undoubted as it seems happens to be too often overlooked even by those whose attention to other points would make one think their neglect of this not an effect of lukewarm indifference so much as of certain mistaken notions and suppositions two principal considerations occur which in this particular seem to have slackened the industry of some otherwise zealous and serious christians  one i apprehend to be this that it is surmised the christian religion is in a declining state which by many symptoms seems likely to end either in popery or a general infidelity and that of course a prudent person has nothing to do but to make sure of his own salvation and to acquiesce in the general tendency of things without being at any fruitless pains to oppose what cannot be prevented to steer against the stream or resist a torrent which as it flows gathers strength and rapidity and in the end will be sure to overflow and carry before it when a man of a desponding and foreboding spirit has been led by his observation of the ways of the world and the prevailing humor of our times to think after this manner he will be inclined to strengthen this his preconceived opinion as is usual in other the like cases by misapplication of holy scripture for instance by those words of our blessed savior luke xviii   when the son of man comes shall he find faith on the earth which have been applied to this very purpose as importing that before the final judgment christian faith should be extinguished upon earth although these words do from the context seem plainly to refer to the destruction of jerusalem and the obstinate blindness of the jews who even then when they felt the hand of god should not acknowledge it or believe the roman army to be the instrument of divine vengeance in the day of their visitation by him whom they had injuriously treated rejected and put to death  but granting the former sense might be supported by no absurd hypothesis or no improbable guess yet shall the endeavors of christian men for propagating the gospel of christ be forestalled by any suppositions or conjectures whatsoever admitting i say those words regard the future advent of jesus christ yet can any one tell how near or how far off that advent may be are not the times and seasons foreknown only to god and shall we neglect a certain duty to day upon an uncertain surmise of what is to come hereafter this way of thinking might furnish as strong reasons against preaching at home as abroad within as without the pale of the church it would be as specious an argument against the one as the other but in reality can conclude against neither for as we know not when that supposed time of general infidelity is to be or whether it will be at all so if it were ever so sure and ever so near it would nevertheless become us to take care that it may not be an effect of our own particular indifference and neglect  but if we take our notions not from the uncertain interpretation of a particular text but from the whole tenor of the divine oracles from the express promise and reiterated predictions of our blessed lord and his apostles we shall believe that phil ii    0    jesus christ is highly exalted of god to the end that at his name every knee shall bow and every tongue confess that he is the lord to the glory of god the father that   cor xv    he must reign till he has put all enemies under his feet that mat xxviii  0 he is with us always even unto the end of the world and that the church of the living god the pillar and ground of truth is so far from being destroyed by human means mat xvi    that the gates of hell all the infernal powers shall not prevail against it let us therefore banish all such conceits as may seem to justify our indolence as may reason us out of all courage and vigor in the race that is set before us let us not i say slacken our own hands nor enfeeble our own knees by preconceived fancies and suppositions considering that as the success of all enterprises in great measure depends on the spirit of the undertakers so nothing is more apt to raise a spirit than hope nor to depress it than despondency we ought therefore to shake off every vain fear in our spiritual warfare the number the presumption and the abilities of those who take counsel together against the lord and against his anointed should not dishearten but rather excite and encourage us to stand in the gap  another consideration that may possibly withhold diverse sincere believers from contributing their endeavors for bringing men to the knowledge of god and christ and thereby to eternal life is the want of miracles in the present age men naturally cast about for reasons to countenance the part they take and as the gift of miracles was of mighty influence and help to those who were commissioned to spread abroad the light of the gospel in its first promulgation so no pretense offers itself more naturally to excuse a man from executing any purpose than the want of authority which in the opinion of men cannot be without a just commission nor this unless distinguished by those proper means and powers that have been known to attend it now with regard to this defect of miracles i shall beg leave to make two observations  first it is to be observed that if we have not miracles we have other advantages which make them less necessary now than in the first spreading of the gospel whole nations have found the benefit of christs religion it is protected by princes established and encouraged by laws supported by learning and arts recommended by the experience of many ages as well as by the authority and example of the wisest it and most knowing men certainly if the greatest part of mankind are gentiles or mahometans it cannot be denied that the most knowing most learned and most improved nations profess christianity and that even the mahometans themselves bear testimony to the divine mission of jesus christ whereas therefore in the beginning a few illiterate wanderers of the meanest of the people had the prejudices the learning and the power of their own as well as other nations in one world the whole world to oppose and overcome those who at this day engage in the propagation of the gospel do it upon terms in many respects far more easy and advantageous it is power against weakness civility against barbarism knowledge against ignorance some or other if not all these advantages in the present times attending the progress of the christian religion in whatever part of the world men shall attempt to plant it  in the second place we may reflect that if we have not the gift of miracles this is a good reason why we should exert more strongly those human means which god has put in our power and make our ordinary faculties whether of the head or the hand or the tongue our interest our credit or our fortune subservient to the great giver of them and cheerfully contribute our humble mite toward hastening that time wherein psalm lxxxvi   all nations whom thou have made shall come and worship before thee o lord and shall glorify thy name it is at least a plain case that the want of apostolical gifts should not be pleaded as a bar to our doing that which in no respect either of difficulty or danger equals or approaches the apostolical office what pretense can this supply for mens being quite unconcerned about the spreading of the gospel or the salvation of souls for mens forgetting that they are christians and related to human kind how can this justify their overlooking opportunities which lie in their way their not contributing a small part of their fortune toward forwarding a design wherein they share neither pains nor peril the not bestowing on it even the cheap assistance of their speech attention counsel or countenance as occasion offers how unlike is this worldly selfish indifference to that account which st paul gives of himself that   cor x    he sought not his own profit but the profit of many that they may be saved and yet herein he expected the corinthians and the same reason will hold for us should be like him for he subjoins be ye followers of me as i also am of christ  having considered the duty in general i come now to treat of it with reference to america the peculiar province of this venerable society which i suppose well informed of the state and progress of religion in that part of the world by their correspondencies with the clergy upon their mission it may nevertheless be expected that one who had been engaged in a design upon this very view who has been upon the place and resided a considerable time in one of our colonies sold have observed somewhat worth reporting it is to be hoped therefore that one part of my audience will pardon what the other may perhaps expect while i detain them with the narrative of a few things i have observed and such reflections as thereupon suggested themselves some part of which may possibly be found to extend to either colonies  rhode island with a portion of the adjacent continent under the same government is inhabited by an english colony consisting chiefly of sectaries of many different denominations who seem to have worn off part of that prejudice which they inherited from their ancestors against the national church of this land though it must be acknowledged at the same time that too many of them have worn off a serious sense of all religion several indeed of the better sort are accustomed to assemble themselves regularly on the lords day for the performance of divine worship but most of those who are dispersed throughout this colony seem to rival some wellbred people of other countries in a thorough indifference for all that is sacred being equally careless of outward worship and of inward principles whether of faith or practice of the bulk of them it may certainly be said that they live without the sacraments not being so much as baptized and as for their morals i apprehend there is nothing to be found in them that should tempt others to make an experiment of their principles either in religion or government but it must be owned the general behavior of the inhabitants in those towns where churches and meetings have been long settled and regularly attended seems so much better as sufficiently to show the difference which a solemn regular worship of god makes between persons of the same blood temper and natural faculties  the native indians who are said to have been formerly many thousands within the compass of this colony do not at present amount to one thousand including every age and sex and these are either all servants or laborers for the english who have contributed more to destroy their bodies by the use of strong liquors than by any means to improve their minds or save their souls this slow poison jointly operating with the smallpox and their wars but much more destructive than both has consumed the indians not only in our colonies but also far and wide upon our consines and having made havoc of them is now doing the same thing by those who taught them that odious vice  the negroes in the government of rhode island are about half as many more than the indians and both together scarce amount to a seventh part of the whole colony the religion of these people as is natural to suppose takes after that of their masters some few are baptized several frequent the different assemblies and far the greater part none at all an ancient antipathy to the indians whom it seems our first planters therein as in certain other particulars affecting to imitate jews rather than christians imagined they had a right to treat on the foot of canaanites or amalekites together with an irrational contempt of the blacks as creatures of another species who had no right to be instruced or admitted to the sacraments have proved a main obstacle to the conversion of these poor people  to this may be added an erroneous notion that the being baptized is inconsistent with a state of slavery to undeceive them in this particular which had too much weight it seemed a proper step if the opinion of his majestys attorney and solicitorgeneral could be procured this opinion they charitably sent over signed with their own hands which was accordingly printed in rhode island and dispersed throughout the plantations i heartily wish it may produce the intended effect it must be owned our reformed planters with respect to the natives and the slaves might learn from those of the church of rome how it is their interest and duty to behave both french and spaniards have intermarried with indians to the great strength security and increase of their colonies they take care to instruct both them and their negroes in the popish religion to the reproach of those who profess a better they have also bishops and seminaries for clergy and it is not found that their colonies are worse subjects or depend less on their mother country on that account  it should seem that the likeliest step toward converting the heathen would be to begin with the english planters whose influence will for ever be an obstacle to propagating the gospel till they have a right sense of it themselves which would show them how much it is their duty to impart it to others the missionaries employed by this venerable society have done and continue to do good service in bringing those planters to a serious sense of religion which it is hoped will in time extend to others i speak it knowingly that the ministers of the gospel in those provinces which go by the name of new england sent and supported at the expense of this society have by their sobriety of manners discreet behavior and a competent degree of useful knowledge shown themselves worthy the choice of those who sent them and particularly in living on a more friendly foot with their brethren of the separation who on their part were also very much come off from that narrowness of spirit which formerly kept them at such an unamicable distance from us and as there is reason to apprehend that part of america could not have been thus distinguished and provided with such a number of proper persons if one half of them had not been supplied out of the dissenting seminaries of the country who in proportion as they attain to more liberal improvements of learning are observed to quit their prejudice toward an episcopal church so i verily think it might increase the number of such useful men if provision were made to defray their charges in coming hither to receive holy orders passing and repassing the ocean and tarrying the necessary time in london requiring an expense that many are not able to bear it would also be an encouragement to the missionaries in general and probably produce good effects if the allowance of certain missionaries were augmented in proportion to the services they had done and the time they had spent in their million these hints i venture to suggest as not unuseful in an age wherein all human encouragements are found more necessary than at the first propagation of the gospel but they are with all due deference and respect submitted to the judgment of this venerable audience  after all it is hardly to be expected that so long as infidelity prevails at home the christian religion should thrive and flourish in our colonies abroad mankind it must be owned left to themselves are so much bewildered and benighted with respect to the origin of that evil which they feel and from which they are at a loss about the means of being freed that the doctrines of the lapsed state of man his reconciliation by christ and regeneration by the spirit may reasonably be hoped to find an easy admission as bringing with them light and comfort into a mind not hardened by impenitency nor foreclosed by pride nor biased by prejudice but such is the vanity of man that no prejudice operates more powerfully than that in favor of fashion and no fashions are so much followed by our colonies as those of the mother country which they often adopt in their modes of living to their great inconvenience without allowing for the disparity of circumstance or climate this same humor has made infidelity as i find it too credibly reported spread in some of our wealthy plantations uneducated men being more apt to tread in the steps of libertines and men of fashion than to model themselves by the laws and institutions of their mother country or the lives and professions of the virtuous and religious part of it  but this is not all while those abroad are less disposed to receive some at home are perhaps less disposed to propagate the gospel from the same cause it is to be feared i say that the prevailing torrent of infidelity which staggers the faith of some may cool the zeal and damp the spirit of others who judging from the event and success of those who impugn the church of christ may possibly entertain some scruple or surmise whether it may not be for the present at least abandoned by providence and that human care must ineffectually interpose till it shall please god yet once more to shake not the earth only but also the heavens this point has been touched before but deserves farther consideration to the end that the peculiar impiety of a profane age may not be a bar to those very endeavors which itself renders more necessary and calls for more loudly now than ever  whatever men may think the arm of the lord is not shortened in all this prevalency of atheism and irreligion there is no advantage gained by the powers of darkness either against god or godly men but only against their own wretched partisans the christian dispensation is a dispensation of grace and favor the christian church a society of men entitled to this grace on performing certain conditions if this society is diminished as those who remain true members of it suffer no loss to themselves so god loses no right suffers no detriment forgoeth no good his grace resisted or unfruitful being no more lost to him than the light of the sun shining on desert places or among people who shut their eyes  besides this excess this unstemmed torrent of profaneness may possibly in the conclusion defeat itself confirm what it meant to extirpate and instead of destroying prove a means of preserving our religion the evil fruits and effects thereof being so notorious and flagrant and so sensibly felt as in all likelihood to be able to open the eyes and rouse the attention of those who may be blind and deaf to every other argument and consideration or who knows but the christian church corrupted by prosperity is to be restored and purified by adversity which may prove for ought we can tell as salutary in future as it has been in past ages many insolent and presumptuous foes have set themselves against the church of god whole hook nevertheless may be in their nostrils and his bridle in their lips managing and governing even their rage and folly to the fulfilling of his own wise purposes and who may not fail in the end to deal by them as he did by the king of assyria when he had isa x    performed his work upon sion and upon jerusalem punishing their stout heart and high looks this presumptuous conqueror was without knowing it a tool or instrument in the hands of that god whom he blasphemed isa x       o assyrian the rod of mine anger i will send him against an hypocritical nation and against the people of my wrath will i give him a charge to take the spoil and to take the prey and to tread them down like the mire of the streets howbeit he means not so neither does his heart think so but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few  thus much at least is evident it is no new thing that great enormities should produce great humiliations and these again noble virtues which have often recovered both single men and whole states even in a natural and civil sense and if the captivities distresses and desolations of the jewish church have occasioned their return to god and reinstated them in his favor nay if it was actually foretold whenever they lay under the curse of god at the mercy of their enemies peeled and scattered in a foreign land that nevertheless upon their calling his covenant to mind and returning to him deuteronomy xxx   the lord their god would turn their captivity and have compassion upon them i say if things were so why may we not in reason hope for something analogous thereto in behalf of the christian church it cannot be denied that there was a great analogy between the jewish institutions and the doctrines of the gospel for instance between the paschal lamb and the lamb of god slain from the foundation of the world between the egyptian bondage and that of sin the earthly canaan and the heavenly the fleshly circumcision and the spiritual in these and many other particulars the analogy seems so plain that it can hardly be disputed to be convinced that the law of moses and the jewish economy were figures and shadows of the evangelical we need only look into the epistle to the hebrews may we not therefore in pursuance of this same analogy suppose a similar treatment of the jewish and christian church  let us then see on what terms the former flood with god in order to discover what the latter may reasonably expect the solemn denunciation to the jews was deuteronomy xxviii   if thou shall hearken diligently unto the voice of the lord thy god to observe and to do all his commandments which i command thee this day that the lord thy god will set thee on high above all the nations of the earth but in case of disobedience it is added among many other threats and maledictions ver       the lord shall smite thee with blasting and with mildew and thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass and the earth that is under thee shall be iron and again ver    the lord shall smite thee with madness and blindness and astonishment of heart have not the people of this land drawn down upon it by more ways than one the just judgments of heaven surely we have felt in a metaphor the first of the forementioned judgments and the last has been literally fulfilled upon us is it not visible that we are less knowing less virtuous less reasonable in proportion as we are less religious are we not grown drunk and giddy with vice and vanity and presumption and freethinking and extravagance of every kind to a degree that we may truly be said to be smitten with madness and blindness and astonishment of heart  as anciently most unchristian schisms and disputes joined with great corruption of manners made way for the mohammedan in the east and the papal dominion in the west even so here at home in the last century a weak reliance upon human politics and power on the one hand and enthusiastic rage on the other together with carnalmindedness on both gave occasion to introduce atheism and infidelity if the temporal state and outward form of the jewish church was upon their defection overturned by invaders in like manner when christians are no longer governed by the light of evangelical truth when we resist the spirit of god are we not to expect that the heaven above will be as brass that the divine grace will no longer shower down on our obdurate hearts that our church and profession will be blasted by licentious scorners those madmen who in sport scatter firebrands arrows and death as all this is no more than we may reasonably suppose will ensue upon our backsliding so we may with equal reason hope it will be remedied upon our return to god  from what has been said it follows that in order to propagate the gospel abroad it is necessary we do it at home and extend our charity to domestic infidels if we would convert or prevent foreign ones so that a view of the declining state of religion here at home of those things that produced this declension and of the proper methods to repair it is naturally connected with the subject of this discourse i shall therefore beg your patience while i just mention a few remarks or hints too obvious perhaps in themselves to be new or unknown to any present but too little visible in their effects to make one think they are by all much attended to  some preferring points notional or ritual to the love of god and man consider the national church only as it stands opposed to other christian societies these generally have a zeal without knowledge and the effects are suitable to the cause they really hurt what they seem to espouse others more solicitous about the discovery of truth than the practice of holiness employ themselves rather to spy out errors in the church than enforce its precepts these it is to be feared postpone the great interests of religion to points of less concern in any eyes but their own but surely they would do well to consider that an humble though confused or indistinct faith in the bond of charity and productive of good works is much more evangelical than any accurate disputing and conceited knowledge  a church which contains the fundamentals and nothing subversive of those fundamentals is not to be set at naught by any particular member because it may not in every point perhaps correspond with his ideas no not though he is sure of being in the right probably there never was or will be an established church in this world without visible marks of humanity upon it saint paul supposes that   cor iii    on the foundation of jesus christ there will be human superstructures of hay and stubble things light and trivial wrong or superstitious which indeed is a natural consequence of the weakness and ignorance of man but where that living foundation is rightly laid in the mind there will not fail to grow and spring from thence those virtues and graces which are the genuine effects and tokens of true faith and which are by no means inconsistent with every error in theory or every needless rite in worship  the christian religion was calculated for the bulk of mankind and therefore cannot reasonably be supposed to consist in subtle and nice notions from the time that divinity was considered as a science and human reason inthroned in the sanctuary of god the hearts of its professors seem to have been less under the influence of grace from that time have grown many unchristian dissensions and controversies of men   timothy vi     knowing nothing but doting about questions and strifes of words whereof comes envy strife railings evil surmises perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds and destitute of truth doubtless the making religion a notional thing has been of infinite disservice and whereas its holy mysteries are rather to be received with humility of faith than defined and measured by the accuracy of human reason all attempts of this kind however well intended have visibly failed in the event and instead of reconciling infidels have by creating disputes and heats among the professors of christianity given no small advantage to its enemies  to conclude if we proportioned our zeal to the importance of things if we could love men whose opinions we do not approve if we knew the world more and liked it less if we had a due sense of the divine perfection and our own defects if our chief study was the wisdom from above described by st paul and if in order to all this that were done in places of education which cannot so well be done out of them i say if these steps were taken at home while proper measures are carrying on abroad the one would very much forward or facilitate the other as it is not meant so it must not be understood that foreign attempts should wait for domestic success but only that it is to be wished they may cooperate certainly if a just and rational a genuine and sincere a warm and vigorous piety animated the mother country the influence thereof would soon reach our foreign plantations and extend throughout their borders we should soon see religion shine forth with new luster and force to the conversion of infidels both at home and abroad and to   cor x   the casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ  to whom with the father and the holy ghost be ascribed all praise might majesty and dominion now and for ever de motu sive

tempore sunt tamen qui motum tanquam ideam quandam simplicem and abstractam atque ab omnibus aliis rebus sejunctam contemplari student verum idea illa tenuissima and subtilissima intellectus aciem eludit id quod quilibet secum meditando experiri potest hinc nascuntur magnae difficultates de natura motus and definitiones ipsa re quam illustrare debent long obscuriores hujusmodi sunt definitiones illae aristotelis and scholasticorum qui motum dicunt esse actum mobilis quatenus est mobile vel actum entis in potentia quatenus in potentia hujusmodi etiam est illud viri inter recentiores celebris qui asserit nihil in motu esse reale praeter momentaneum illud quod in vi ad mutationem nitente constitui debet porro constat horum and similium definitionum auctores in animo habuisse abstractam motus naturam seclusa omni temporis and spatii consideratione explicare sed qua ratione abstracta illa motus quintessentia ut ita dicam intelligi possit non video     neque hoc contenti ulterius

instantaneum motus elementum spectantes velocitatem insuper conatum vim impetum totidem res essentia diversas esse volunt quarum quaeque per propriam atque ab aliis omnibus segregatam and abstractam ideam intellectui objiciatur sed in hisce rebus discutiendis stantibus iis quae supra disseruimus non est cur diutius immoremur     multi etiam per transitum motu desiniunt obliti scilicet transitum ipsum sine motu intelligi non posse and per motum definiri oportere verissimum adeo est definitiones sicut nonnullis rebus lucem ita vicissim aliis tenebras afferre et profecto quascumque res sensu

plurmum ipsi peperissent implicavere ex hocce definiendi simulac abstrahendi studio maltae tam de motu quam de aliis rebus natae subtilissimae quaestiones eaedemque nullius utilitatis hominum ingenia frustra torserunt adeo ut aristoteles ultro and saepius fateatur motum esse actum quendam cognitu difficilem and nonnulli ex veteribus usque eo nugis exercitati deveniebant ut motum omnino esse negarent     sed hujusmodi minutiis distineri piget satis sit fontes solutionum indicasse ad quos etiam illud adjungere libet quod ea quae de infinita divisione temporis and spatii in mathesi traduntur ob congenitam rerum naturam paradoxa and theorias spinosas quales sunt illae omnes in quibus agitur de infinito in speculationes de motu intulerunt quidquid autem hujus generis sit id omne motus commune habet cum spatio and tempore vel potius ad ea refert acceptum     et quemadmodum ex una part nimia abstractio seu divisio rerum vere inseparabilium ita ab altera part compositio seu potius confusio rerum diversissimarum motus naturam perplexam reddidit usitatum enim est motum cum causa motus efficiente confundere unde accidit ut motus sit quasi biformis unam faciem sensibus obviam alteram caliginosa nocte obvolutam habens inde obscuritas and confusio and varia de motu paradoxa originem trahunt dum effectui perperam tribuitur id quod revera causae solummodo competit

cuivis facile constabit aristoteles quidem l   physicorum ubi quaerit utrum motus factus sit and corruptus an vero ab aeterno tanquam vita immortalis insit rebus omnibus vitale principium poius quam effectum externum sive mutationem loci intellexisse videtur     hinc etiam est quod multi suspicantur motum non esse meram passionem in corporibus quod si intelligamus id quod in motu corporis

aliorum conceptus intelligendos quam ad suos enunciandos in qua re nisi peccatum esset vix credo in disputationem trahi potuisse utrum corpus indifferens sit ad motum and ad quietem necne quoniam enim experientia constat esse legem naturae primariam ut corpus perinde perseveret in statu motus ac quietis quamdiu aliunde nihil accidat ad statum istum mutandum et propterea vim inertiae sub diverso respectu esse vel resistentiam vel impetum colligitur hoc sensu profecto corpus dici potest sua natura indifferens ad motum vel quietem nimirum tam difficile est quietem in corpus motum quam motum in
