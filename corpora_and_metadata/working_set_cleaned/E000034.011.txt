portraits when mrs izard accepted the other and should have presented it to her with the greatest pleasure she did not appear to desire it and i did not presume it of value enough to be offered her quarrel with me on that account is pleasing the reconciliation when i can obtain it will be more so at present another lady has put it out of my power to comply with the terms m de chaumont at whose pottery in the country they were made receiving a request from petersburg for one of them to gratify the curiosity of the empress and having none in town he got from me the only one i had left and has sent it away but i am promised another soon and shall seize the first   moment of making my peace with it in the meantime i hope you will intercede for me in that heart where i am sure you have an interest accept my thanks for the books from the reading of which i promise myself a good deal of pleasure please to accept also the trifle enclosed and believe me with most sincere esteem etc b franklin benjamin franklin   january      passy david hartley mcccxix to david hartley passy   january      my dear friend— i received your kind letter of december  st from bath i am glad to hear that your good sister is in a fair way towards recovery my respects and best wishes attend her i communicated your letter to mr jefferson to remind him of his promise to communicate to you the intelligence he might receive from america on the subjects you mention and now having got back i shall endeavor to answer the other parts of it what you propose to draw up of your opinions on american negotiation may be of great use if laid as you intend before administration in case they seriously intend to enter on it after the meeting of parliament for i know your ideas all tend to a good understanding between the two countries and their common advantage and in my mind too all selfish projects of partial profit are the effects of shortsightedness   they never producing permanent benefits and are at length the causes of discord and its consequences wherein much more is spent than all the temporary gains amounted to i do not know that any one is yet appointed by your court to treat with us we some time since acquainted your minister with our powers and disposition to treat which he communicated to his court and received for answer that his majestys ministers were ready to receive any propositions we might have to make for the common benefit of both countries but they thought it more for the honor of both that the treaty should not be in a third place we answered that though we did not see much inconvenience in treating here we would as soon as we had finished some affairs at present on our hands wait upon them if they pleased in london we have since heard nothing we have no late accounts from america of any importance you know the congress adjourned the beginning of june till the beginning of november and since their meeting there has been no account of their proceedings all the stories in your papers relating to their divisions are fiction as well as those of the people being discontented with congressional government mr jay writes to me that they were at no time more happy or more satisfied with their government than at present nor ever enjoyed more tranquillity or prosperity in truth the freedom of their ports to all nations has brought in a vast plenty of foreign goods and occasioned a demand for their produce the consequence of which is the double   advantage of buying what they consume cheap and selling what they can spare dear if we should come to london i hope it may still be with you that we are to do business our already understanding one another may save on many points a good deal of time in discussion but i doubt whether any treaty is intended on your part and i fancy we shall not press it it may perhaps be best to give both sides time to inquire and to feel for the interests they cannot see with sincere and great esteem i am ever my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin benjamin franklin   february      passy john jay mcccxx to john jay passy   february      dear sir— i received by the marquis de lafayette your kind letter of the   th of december it gave me pleasure on two accounts as it informed me of the public welfare and that of your i may almost say our dear little family for since i had the pleasure of their being with me in the same house i have ever felt a tender affection for them equal i believe to that of most fathers i did hope to have heard by the last packet of your having accepted the secretaryship of foreign affairs but was disappointed i write to you now therefore only as a private friend yet i may mention respecting public affairs that as far as i can   perceive the good disposition of this court towards us continues i wish i could say as much for the rest of the european courts i think that their desire of being connected with us by treaties is of late much abated and this i suppose is occasioned by the pains britain takes to represent us everywhere as distracted with divisions discontented with our goverments the people unwilling to pay taxes the congress unable to collect them and many desiring the restoration of the old government the english papers are full of this stuff and their ministers get it copied into the foreign papers the moving about of the congress from place to place has also a bad effect in giving color to the reports of their being afraid of the people i hope they will soon settle somewhere and by the steadiness and wisdom of their measures dissipate all those mists of misrepresentation raised by the remaining malice of ancient enemies and establish our reputation for national justice and prudence as they have done for courage and perseverance it grieves me that we have not been able to discharge our first years payment of interest to this court due the beginning of last month i hope it will be the only failure and that effectual measures will be taken to be exactly punctual hereafter the good master says the proverb is lord of another mans purse the bad one if he ever has again occasion to borrow must pay dearly for his carelessness and injustice you are happy in having got back safe to your country i should be less unhappy if i could imagine   the delay of my congé useful to the states or in the least degree necessary but they have many equally capable of doing all i have to do here the new proposed treaties are the most important things but two can go through them as well as three if indeed any are likely to be completed which i begin to doubt since the new ones make little progress and the old ones which wanted only the fiat of congress seem now to be going rather backward—i mean those i had projected with denmark and portugal my grandsons are sensible of the honor of your remembrance and present their respects to you and mrs jay i add my best wishes of health and happiness to you all being with sincere esteem and affection dear sir your most obedient humble servant b franklin benjamin franklin   february      passy francis childs mcccxxi to mr francis childs printer at new york passy   february      sir— i have received your letter of november   th with the preceding one therein mentioned i had some discourse with mr jay respecting you and i expressed a willingness to assist you in setting up your business on the same terms as i had formerly done with other young printers of good character viz whitemarsh and timothy in carolina smith and afterwards mecon at antigua parker at new york franklin at rhode island holland miller at lancaster and afterwards dunlap and hall at   philadelphia but nothing was concluded between us and i expected to have been in america before this time with a very large quantity of types which i have packed up i still hope to be there in the ensuing summer when we may carry this proposal into execution if it shall suit you in the meantime i would not have you miss any good opportunity of settling yourself for i am old and infirm and accidents may prevent us the good character given of you by mr jay is my inducement to serve you if i can and it will give me pleasure if it succeeds i am obliged to you for the care you took in securing my press and am your friend and servant b franklin sir— if mrs parker still lives at woodbridge perhaps she can show you the agreement between her husband and me and you may consider the terms of it before my arrival benjamin franklin   february      passy mcccxxii to the president of congress passy   february      sir— i received by the marquis de lafayette the two letters you did me the honor of writing to me the   th and   th of december the one enclosing a letter from congress to the king the other a resolve of congress respecting the convention for establishing consuls the letter was immediately delivered and well received the resolve came too late to suspend  0 signing the convention it having been done july last and a copy sent so long since that we now expected the ratification as that copy seems to have miscarried i now send another i am not informed what objection has arisen in congress to the plan sent me mr jefferson thinks it may have been to the part which restrained the consuls from all concern in commerce that article was omitted being thought unnecessary to be stipulated since either party would always have the power of imposing such restraints on its own officers whenever it should think fit i am however of opinion that this or any other reasonable article or alteration may be obtained at the desire of congress and established by a supplement permit me sir to congratulate you on your being called to the high honor of presiding in our national councils and to wish you every felicity being with the most perfect esteem etc b franklin benjamin franklin   march      passy william strahan mcccxxiii to william strahan esq passy   march      dear friend— i received your kind letter by my grandson i thank you for the civilities you showed him when in london i hope to get home this ensuing summer i shall have an old account to settle then with the family of our friend hall there is a particular article of some importance about which we were not agreed but    were to be determined by your opinion it was the value of a copyright in an established newspaper of each of which from eight to ten thousand were printed my long absence from that country and immense employment the little time i was there have hitherto prevented the settlement of all the accounts that had been between us though we never differed about them and never should if that good honest man had continued in being to prevent all dispute on the above points with his son it is that i now request your decision which i doubt not will be satisfactory to us both with unchangeable esteem i am ever my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin my respects to mrs strahan benjamin franklin    march      passy benjamin vaughan mcccxxiv to benjamin vaughan  passy    march      my dear friend— among the thoughts you lately sent me was one entitled thoughts on executive    justice in return for that i send you a french one on the same subject observations concernant dexécution de larticle ii de la déclaration sur le vol they are both addressed to the judges but written as you will see in a very different spirit the english author is for hanging all thieves the frenchman is for proportioning punishments to offences if we really believe as we profess to believe that the law of moses was the law of god the dictate of divine wisdom infinitely superior to human on what principles do we ordain death as the punishment of an offence which according to that law was only to be punished by a restitution of fourfold to put a man to death for an offence which does not deserve death is it not murder and as the french writer says doiton punir délit contre la société par un crime contre la nature superfluous property is the creature of society simple and mild laws were sufficient to guard the property that was merely necessary the savages bow his hatchet and his coat of skins were sufficiently secured without law by the fear of personal resentment and retaliation when by virtue of the first laws part of the society accumulated wealth and grew powerful they enacted others more severe and would protect their property at the expense of humanity this was abusing their power and commencing a tyranny if a savage before he entered into society had been told your neighbor by this means may become owner of a hundred deer but if your brother or your son or yourself having no    deer of your own and being hungry should kill one an infamous death must be the consequence he would probably have preferred his liberty and his common right of killing any deer to all the advantages of society that might be proposed to him that it is better a hundred guilty persons should escape than one innocent person should suffer is a maxim that has been long and generally approved never that i know of controverted even the sanguinary author of the thoughts agrees to it p     adding well that the very thought of injured innocence and much more that of suffering innocence must awaken all our tenderest and most compassionate feelings and at the same time raise our highest indignation against the instruments of it but he adds there is no danger of either from a strict adherence to the laws really is it then impossible to make an unjust law and if the law itself be unjust may it not be the very instrument which ought to raise the authors and everybodys highest indignation i read in the last newspaper from london that a woman is capitally convicted at the old bailey for privately stealing out of a shop some gauze value fourteen shillings and threepence is there any proportion between the injury done by a theft value fourteen shillings and threepence and the punishment of a human creature by death on a gibbet might not that woman by her labor have made the reparation ordained by god in paying fourfold is not all punishment inflicted beyond the merit of the offence so much punishment of    innocence in this light how vast is the annual quantity of not only injured but suffering innocence in almost all the civilized states of europe but it seems to have been thought that this kind of innocence may be punished by way of preventing crimes i have read indeed of a cruel turk in barbary who whenever he bought a new christian slave ordered him immediately to be hung up by the legs and to receive a hundred blows of a cudgel on the soles of his feet that the severe sense of the punishment and fear of incurring it thereafter might prevent the faults that should merit it our author himself would hardly approve entirely of this turks conduct in the government of slaves and yet he appears to recommend something like it for the government of english subjects when he applauds p  0  the reply of judge burnet to the convict horsestealer who being asked what he had to say why judgment of death should not pass against him and answering that it was hard to hang a man for only stealing a horse was told by the judge man thou are not to be hanged only for stealing a horse but that horses may not be stolen the mans answer if candidly examined will i imagine appear reasonable as being founded on the eternal principle of justice and equity that punishments should be proportioned to offences and the judges reply brutal and unreasonable though the writer wishes all judges to carry it with them whenever they go the circuit and to bear it in their minds as containing a wise reason for all the penal statutes which they are called upon to put in execution    it at once illustrates says he the true grounds and reasons of all capital punishments whatsoever namely that every mans property as well as his life may be held sacred and inviolate is there then no difference in value between property and life if i think it right that the crime of murder should be punished with death not only as an equal punishment of the crime but to prevent other murders does it follow that i must approve of inflicting the same punishment for a little invasion on my property by theft if i am not myself so barbarous so bloodyminded and revengeful as to kill a fellowcreature for stealing from me fourteen shillings and threepence how can i approve of a law that does it montesquieu who was himself a judge endeavors to impress other maxims he must have known what humane judges feel on such occasions and what the effects of those feelings and so far from thinking that severe and excessive punishments prevent crimes he asserts as quoted by our french writer page   that— latrocité des loix en empêche lexécution lorsque la peine est sans mesure on est souvent obligé de lui préférer limpunité la cause de tous les relâchemens vient de limpunité des crimes et non de la modération des peines  it is said by those who know europe generally that there are more thefts committed and punished    annually in england than in all the other nations put together if this be so there must be a cause or causes for such depravity in your common people may not one be the deficiency of justice and morality in your national government manifested in your oppressive conduct to your subjects and unjust wars on your neighbors view the longpersisted in unjust monopolizing treatment of ireland at length acknowledged view the plundering government exercised by your merchants in the indies the confiscating war made upon the american colonies and to say nothing of those upon france and spain view the late war upon holland which was seen by impartial europe in no other light than that of a war of rapine and pillage the hopes of an immense and easy prey being its only apparent and probably its true and real motive and encouragement justice is as strictly due between neighbor nations as between neighbor citizens a highwayman is as much a robber when he plunders in a gang as when single and a nation that makes an unjust war is only a great gang after employing your people in robbing the dutch is it strange that being put out of that employ by the peace they should continue robbing and rob one another piraterie as the french call it or privateering is the universal bent of the english nation at home or abroad wherever settled no less than seven hundred privateers were it is said commissioned in the last war these were fitted out by merchants to prey upon other merchants who had never done them any injury is there probably any one of those privateering    merchants of london who were so ready to rob the merchants of amsterdam that would not as readily plunder another london merchant of the next street if he could do it with the same impunity the avidity the alieni appetens is the same it is the fear alone of the gallows that makes the difference how then can a nation which among the honestest of its people has so many thieves by inclination and whose government encouraged and commissioned no less than seven hundred gangs of robbers—how can such a nation have the face to condemn the crime in individuals and hang up twenty of them in a morning it naturally puts one in mind of a newgate anecdote one of the prisoners complained that in the night somebody had taken his buckles out of his shoes what the devil says another have we then thieves among us it must not be suffered let us search out the rogue and pump him to death there is however one late instance of an english merchant who will not profit by such illgotten gains he was it seems partowner of a ship which the other owners thought fit to employ as a letter of marque and which took a number of french prizes the booty being shared he has now an agent here inquiring by an advertisement in the gazette for those who suffered the loss in order to make them as far as in him lies restitution this conscientious man is a quaker the scotch presbyterians were formerly as tender for there is still extant an ordinance of the town council of edinburgh made soon after the reformation forbidding the purchase of prize goods under pain of losing the freedom of the    burgh forever with other punishment at the will of the magistrate the practice of making prizes being contrary to good conscience and the rule of treating christian brethren as we would wish to be treated and such goods are not to be sold by any godly men within this burgh the race of these godly men in scotland is probably extinct or their principles abandoned since as far as that nation had a hand in promoting the war against the colonies prizes and confiscations are believed to have been a considerable motive it has been for some time a generally received opinion that a military man is not to inquire whether a war be just or unjust he is to execute his orders all princes who are disposed to become tyrants must probably approve of this opinion and be willing to establish it but is it not a dangerous one since on that principle if the tyrant commands his army to attack and destroy not only an unoffending neighbor nation but even his own subjects the army is bound to obey a negro slave in our colonies being commanded by his master to rob or murder a neighbor or do any other immoral act may refuse and the magistrate will protect him in his refusal the slavery then of a soldier is worse than that of a negro a conscientious officer if not restrained by the apprehension of its being imputed to another cause may indeed resign rather than be employed in an unjust war but the private men are slaves for life and they are perhaps incapable of judging for themselves we can only lament their fate and still more that of a sailor who is often dragged by force    from his honest occupation and compelled to imbrue his hands in perhaps innocent blood but methinks it well behooves merchants men more enlightened by their education and perfectly free from any such force or obligation to consider well of the justice of a war before they voluntarily engage a gang of ruffians to attack their fellow merchants of a neighboring nation to plunder them of their property and perhaps ruin them and their families if they yield it or to wound maim and murder them if they endeavor to defend it yet these things are done by christian merchants whether a war be just or unjust and it can hardly be just on both sides they are done by english and american merchants who nevertheless complain of private theft and hang by dozens the thieves they have taught by their own example it is high time for the sake of humanity that a stop were put to this enormity the united states of america though better situated than any european nation to make profit by privateering most of the trade of europe with the west indies passing before their doors are as far as in them lies endeavoring to abolish the practice by offering in all their treaties with other powers an article engaging solemnly that in case of future war no privateer shall be commissioned on either side and that unarmed merchantships on both sides shall pursue their voyages unmolested  this will be a happy improvement  0 of the laws of nations the humane and the just cannot but wish general success to the proposition with unchangeable esteem and affection i am my dear friend ever yours b franklin benjamin franklin    march      passy richard price mcccxxv to richard price passy    march      dear friend— my nephew mr williams will have the honor of delivering you this line it is to request from you a list of a few books to the value    of about twentyfive pounds such as are most proper to inculcate principles of sound religion and just government a new town in the state of massachusetts having done me the honor of naming itself after me and proposing to build a steeple to their meetinghouse if i would give them a bell i have advised the sparing themselves the expense of a steeple for the present and that they would accept of books instead of a bell sense being preferable to sound these are therefore intended as the commencement of a little parochial library for the use of a society of intelligent respectable farmers such as our country people generally consist of besides your own works i would only mention on the recommendation of my sister stennetts discourses on personal religion which may be one book of the number if you know and approve it  with the highest esteem and respect i am ever my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin    benjamin franklin    march      passy william carmichael mcccxxvi to william carmichael passy    march      dear sir— i received duly your letter of the   th past which gave me great pleasure as the length of time since i had heard from you made me apprehensive that you might be ill i immediately communicated the papers enclosed with it to my colleagues messrs adams and jefferson and we have had several meetings on the barbary affair probably by next weeks post we may write fully upon it to you and to morocco i am glad you are likely to succeed in obtaining the liberty of our silly countryman the discipline they have granted him is however not misapplied mr grand being now in cash your bills on him for your salary will be fully honored i mention your drawing on him because probably i may not be here as i expect daily the permission of congress to return home and shall embrace the first opportunity wherever i am be assured of the invariable esteem and attachment of dear sir your affectionate friend b franklin benjamin franklin    april      passy mcccxxvii to the president of congress passy    april      sir— m de chaumont who will have the honor of presenting this line to your excellency is a young    gentleman of excellent character whose father was one of our most early friends in this country which he manifested by crediting us with a thousand barrels of gunpowder and other military stores in      before we had provided any apparent means of payment he has as i understand some demands to make on congress the nature of which i am unacquainted with but my regard for the family makes me wish that they may obtain a speedy consideration and such favorable issue as they may appear to merit to this end i beg leave to recommend him to your countenance and protection and am with great respect etc b franklin benjamin franklin    april      passy jonathan williams mcccxxviii to jonathan williams esq passy    april      dear cousin— i received your letter of december   th relating to jonas hartwell i had before written to our minister at madrid mr carmichael requesting him to apply for the release of that man enclosed i send his answer with copies of other papers relating to the affair the simpleton will be discharged perhaps after being a little whipped for his folly and that may not be amiss we have here another new england man thayer formerly a candidate for the ministry who converted himself lately at rome and is now preparing to return home for the purpose of converting his countrymen our ancestors from catholic became first churchofengland men and then refined into presbyterians to    change now from presbyterianism to popery seems to me refining backwards from white sugar to brown i have written to dr price of london requesting him to make a choice of proper books to commence a library for the use of the inhabitants of franklin the parcel will be sent directly from thence jonathan and his family are well he expects to be with you soon i continue very hearty and well except my malady of the stone which however is hitherto very tolerable my love to cousin grace etc and believe me ever your affectionate uncle b franklin p s april   th—i send enclosed a bill drawn by w vernon junior on his father for   0 livres which i request you would receive and deliver to my sister mecom benjamin franklin  0 april      passy john ingenhousz mcccxxix to john ingenhousz passy  0 april      dear sir— i thank you much for the postscript respecting my disorder the stone i have taken heretofore and am now again taking the remedy you mention which is called blackries solvent it is the soap lye with limewater and i believe it may have some effect in diminishing the symptoms and preventing the growth of the stone which is all i expect from it it does not hurt my appetite i sleep well and enjoy my friends in cheerful conversation as usual but as i cannot use much exercise i eat more sparingly than formerly and i drink no wine    i admire that you should be so timid in asking leave of your good imperial master to make a journey for visiting a friend i am persuaded you would succeed and i hope the proposition i have repeated to you in this letter will assist your courage and enable you to ask and obtain if you come hither soon you may when present get your book finished and be ready to proceed with me to america while writing this i have received from congress my leave to return and i believe i shall be ready to embark by the middle of july at farthest i shall now be free from politics for the rest of my life welcome again my dear philosophical amusements i see by a full page of your letter that you have been possessed with strange ideas of america that there is no justice to be obtained there no recovery of debts projects of insurrection to overturn the present goverment etc etc that a virginia colonel nephew of the governor had cheated a stranger of a hundred thousand livres and that somebody was imprisoned for only speaking of it and the like very improbable stories they are all fictions or misrepresentations if they were truths all strangers would avoid such a country and foreign merchants would as soon carry their goods to sell in newgate as america think a little on the sums england has spent to preserve a monopoly of the trade of that people with whom they had long been acquainted and of the desire all europe is now manifesting to obtain a share of that trade our ports are full of their ships their merchants buying and selling in our streets continually and returning    with our products would this happen could such commerce be continued with us if we were such a collection of scoundrels and villains as we have been represented to you and insurrections against our rulers are not only unlikely as the rulers are the choice of the people but unnecessary as if not liked they may be changed continually by the new elections i own you have cause great cause to complain of —— but you are wrong to condemn the whole country by a single example i have seen many countries and i do not know a country in the world in which justice is so well administered where protection and favor have so little power to impede its operations and where debts are recovered with so much facility if i thought it such a country as has been painted to you i should certainly never return to it the truth i believe is that more goods have been carried thither from all parts of europe than the consumption of the country requires and it is natural that some of the adventurers are willing to discourage others from following them lest the prices should still be kept down by the arrival of fresh cargoes and it is not unlikely that some negligent or unfaithful factors sent thither may have given such accounts to excuse their not making remittances and the english magnify all this and spread it abroad in their papers to dissuade foreigners from attempting to interfere with them in their commerce with us your account of the emperors condescending conversation with you concerning me is pleasing i respect very much the character of that monarch and    think that if i were one of his subjects he would find me a good one i am glad that his difference with your country is likely to be accommodated without bloodshed the courier de leurope and some other papers printed a letter on that difference which they ascribed to me be assured my friend that i never wrote it nor was ever presumptuous enough to meddle with an affair so much out of my way yours etc b franklin benjamin franklin    april      passy benjamin vaughan mcccxxx to benjamin vaughan esq passy    april      dear friend— i received your kind letter of the   d past by mr perry with the other bottle of blackrie i thank you much for your care in sending them i should have been glad to be of any use to mr perry but he had placed his children before i saw him and he stayed with me only a few minutes we see much in parliamentary proceedings and in papers and pamphlets of the injury the concessions to ireland will do to the manufacturers of england while the people of england seem to be forgotten as if quite out of the question if the irish can manufacture cottons and stuffs and silks and linens and cutlery and toys and books etc etc etc so as to sell them cheaper in england than the manufacturers of england sell them is not this good for the people of england who are not manufacturers and will not even the manufacturers themselves share the    benefit since if cottons are cheaper all the other manufacturers who wear cottons will save in that article and so of the rest if books can be had much cheaper from ireland which i believe for i bought blackstone there for twentyfour shillings when it was sold in england at four guineas is not this an advantage not to english booksellers indeed but to english readers and to learning and of all the complainants perhaps these booksellers are least worthy of consideration the catalogue you last sent me amazes me by the high prices said to be the lowest affixed to each article and one can scarce see a new book without observing the excessive artifices made use of to puff up a paper of verses into a pamphlet a pamphlet into an octavo and an octavo into a quarto with scabboardings whitelines sparse titles of chapters and exorbitant margins to such a degree that the selling of paper seems now the object and printing on it only the pretence i enclose the copy of a page in a late comedy between every two lines there is a white space equal to another line you have a law i think against butchers blowing of veal to make it look fatter why not one against booksellers blowing of books to make them look bigger all this to yourself you can easily guess the reason my grandson is a little indisposed but sends you two pamphlets figaro and le roy voyageur the first is a play of beaumarchais which has had a great run here the other a representation of all the supposed errors of government in this country some of which are probably exaggerated it is not publicly sold we shall send some more shortly    please to remember me very respectfully and affectionately to good dr price i am glad that he has printed a translation of the testament it may do good i am ever my dear friend yours most sincerely b franklin enclosed in the foregoing letter scene iv sir john and wildmore sir john whither so fast wildmore to the opera

return your paper relating to maïs which i have perused with pleasure i am glad to learn that good beer may be made of it which is new to me i send herewith some observations on the use of that grain of which you are at liberty to make such use as you may think proper your patisseur has done wonders i am delighted with his productions and shall wish to take a quantity of them with me to eat at sea with great esteem etc b franklin benjamin franklin    april      passy john ingenhousz mcccxxxii to john ingenhousz passy    april      my dear friend—    lady dowager penn was here about the time of the treaty and made application to me with great complaints but i found she was not well informed of the state of her affairs and could not clearly show that she had suffered any injury from the public of pennsylvania whatever she might from the agents of the family her husbands lands i understand were not confiscated as represented but the proprietary government falling with that of the crown the assembly took the opportunity of insisting upon justice in some points    which they could never obtain under that government a kind of compromise then was made between the assembly and the family whereby all the vacant lots and unappropriated wilderness lands were to be henceforth in the disposition of the assembly who were to pay £  0000 sterling to the family within three years after the peace all other demands on both sides being thus abolished i am told that this arrangement was satisfactory to most of them but as the lady intended to send her son over to solicit her interests i gave him a letter of recommendation to the governor proposing it for consideration whether it might not be advisable to reconsider the matter and if the sum of £  0000 should be found insufficient to make a proper addition i have not heard what has since been done in the affair or whether any thing in my own judgment when i consider that for nearly eighty years viz from the year   00 william penn and his sons received the quitrents which were originally granted for the support of government and yet refused to support the government obliging the people to make a fresh provision for its support all that time which cost them vast sums as the most necessary laws were not to be obtained but at the price of making such provision when i consider the meanness and cruel avarice of the late proprietor in refusing for several years of war to consent to any defence of the frontiers ravaged all the while by the enemy unless his estate should be exempted from paying any part of the expense not to mention other atrocities too long for this letter i cannot but think the family well off    and that it will be prudent in them to take the money and be quiet william penn the first proprietor father of thomas the husband of the present dowager was a wise and good man and as honest to the people as the extreme distress of his circumstances would permit him to be but the said thomas was a miserable churl always intent upon griping and saving and whatever good the father may have done for the province was amply undone by the mischief received from the son who never did any thing that had the appearance of generosity or public spirit but what was extorted from him by solicitation and the shame of backwardness in benefits evidently incumbent on him to promote and which was done at last in the most ungracious manner possible the ladys complaints of not duly receiving her revenues from america are habitual they were the same during all the time of my long residence in london being then made by her husband as excuses for the meanness of his housekeeping and his deficiency in hospitality though i knew at the same time that he was then in full receipt of vast sums annually by the sale of lands interest of money and quitrents but probably he might conceal this from his lady to induce greater economy as it is known that he ordered no more of his income home than was absolutely necessary for his subsistence but placed it at interest in pennsylvania and the jerseys where he could have six or seven per cent while money bore no more than five per cent in england i used often to hear of these complaints and laugh at them perceiving clearly their motive they served him on    other as well as on domestic occasions you remember our rector of st martins parish dr saunders he once went about during a long and severe frost soliciting charitable contributions to purchase coals for poor families he came among others to me and i gave him something it was but little very little and yet it occasioned him to remark you are more bountiful on this occasion than your wealthy proprietary mr penn but he tells me he is distressed by not receiving his incomes from america the incomes of the family there must still be very great for they have a number of manors consisting of the best lands which are preserved to them and vast sums at interest well secured by mortgages so that if the dowager does not receive her proportion there must be some fault in her agents you will perceive by the length of this article that i have been a little échauffé by her making the complaints you mention to the princess dowager of lichtenstein at vienna the lady herself is good and amiable and i should be glad to serve her in any thing just and reasonable but i do not at present see that i can do more than i have done    b franklin benjamin franklin    april      passy john ingenhousz mcccxxxiii to john ingenhousz passy    april      my dear friend—    i confess that a man who can leave so many letters so long unanswered does not deserve so valuable a correspondence    as yours but i am grown very old being now in my eightieth year i am engaged in much business that must not be neglected writing becomes more and more irksome to me i grow more indolent philosophic discussions not being urgent like business are postponed from time to time till they are forgotten besides i have been these twenty months past afflicted with the stone which is always giving me more or less uneasiness unless when i am laid in bed and when i would write it interrupts my train of thinking so that i lay down my pen and seek some light amusement i consent to your request concerning my paper on the weathercock struck by lightning dispose of it as you please you will find an account of the first great stroke i received in pages   0     of my book fifth edition       the second i will now give you i had a paralytic patient in my chamber whose friends brought him to receive some electric shocks i made them join hands so as to receive the shock at the same time and i charged two large jars to give it by the number of those people i was obliged to quit my usual standing and placed myself inadvertently under an iron hook which hung from the ceiling down to within two inches of my head and communicated by a wire with the outside of the jars i attempted to discharge them and in fact did so but i did not perceive it though the charge went through    me and not through the persons i intended it for i neither saw the flash heard the report nor felt the stroke when my senses returned i found myself on the floor i got up not knowing how that had happened i then again attempted to discharge the jars but one of the company told me they were already discharged which i could not at first believe but on trial found it true they told me they had not felt it but they saw i was knocked down by it which had greatly surprised them on recollecting myself and examining my situation i found the case clear a small swelling rose on the top of my head which continued sore for some days but i do not remember any other effect good or bad the stroke you received and its consequences are much more curious i communicated that part of your letter to an operator encouraged by government here to electrify epileptic and other poor patients and advised his trying the practice on mad people according to your opinion i have not heard whether he has done it b franklin benjamin franklin   may      passy count de vergennes mcccxxxiv to count de vergennes passy   may

pay my devoirs at versailles personally may i beg the favor of you sir to express respectfully for    me to his majesty the deep sense i have of all the inestimable benefits his goodness has conferred on my country a sentiment that it will be the business of the little remainder of life now left me to impress equally on the minds of all my countrymen my sincere prayers are that god may shower down his blessings on the king the queen their children and all the royal family to the latest generations permit me at the same time to offer you my thankful acknowledgments for the protection and countenance you afforded me at my arrival and your many favors during my residence here of which i shall always retain the same grateful remembrance my grandson would have had the honor of waiting on you with this letter but he has been some time ill of a fever with the greatest esteem and respect and best wishes for the constant prosperity of yourself and all your amiable family i am sir your

in fact i am the person obliged i passed a long winter which appeared the shortest of any i ever passed such is the effect of pleasing society with friends one loves i have now received my permission to return and am making my preparations i hope to get away in june i promise myself or rather flatter myself that i shall be happy when at home but however happy that circumstance may make me your joining me there will surely make me happier provided your change of country may be for the advantage of your dear little family when you have made up your mind on the subject let me know by a line that i may prepare a house for you as near me and otherwise as convenient for you as possible my neighbors begin to come out from paris and replace themselves in their passy houses they inquire after you and are sorry you are gone before they could make themselves known to you m le veillard in particular has told me at different times what indeed i knew long since cest une bien digne femme cette madame hewson une trés aimable femme i would not tell you this if i thought it would make you vain but that is impossible you have too much good sense so wish me a good voyage and when you pray at church for all that travel by land or sea think of your affectionate friend b franklin p s—my love to william and thomas and eliza and tell them i miss their cheerful prattle temple    being sick and

now preparing for my departure and hope to get away by the middle of next month or the end at farthest though i know not yet whether it will be by the packet or some other vessel fearing that the packet may be crowded with passengers i have desired my    cousin jonathan williams now in london to enquire whether there may not be found some good vessel bound directly to philadelphia who would agree to take me on board at havre with my grandsons and servants with my baggage etc infirm as i am i have need of comfortable room and accommodation i was miserably lodged in coming over hither which almost demolished me i must be better stowed now or i shall not be able to hold out the voyage indeed my friends here are so apprehensive for me that they press me much to remain in france and three of them have offered me an asylum in their habitations they tell me that i am here among a people who universally esteem and love me that my friends at home are diminished by death in my absence that i may there meet with envy and its consequent enmity which here i am perfectly free from this supposing i live to complete the voyage but of that they doubt the desire however of spending the little remainder of life with my family is so strong as to determine me to try at least whether i can bear the motion of the ship if not i must get them to set me on shore somewhere in the channel and content myself to die in europe it is long since i have heard from you or of you i hope however that you and the children continue well ben is very well and grows amazingly he promises to be a stout as well as a good man temple has been ill lately with a fever but is getting better and sends his duty i suppose ben writes i am ever my dear children your affectionate father b franklin  0 benjamin

more my little friend whose singular attachment to me i shall always remember i shall be glad to render any acceptable service to mr randall i conveyed the bayberry wax to abbé de chalut with your

entitled du gouvernement et des mœurs which is thought to contain many matters that may be useful    in america desired to know of me how he could convey a number of printed copies to be distributed gratis among the members of congress i advised his addressing the package to you by way of amsterdam whence a friend of mine would forward it it is accordingly shipped there on board the van berckel captain w campbell there are good things in the work but its chapter on the liberty of the press appears to me to contain more rhetoric than reason with great esteem i am ever etc b franklin benjamin franklin    may      passy jonathan williams mcccxl to jonathan williams passy    may      —— the conversations you mention respecting america are suitable those people speak what they wish but she was certainly never in a more happy situation they are angry with us and speak all manner of evil of us but we flourish notwithstanding they put me in mind of a violent high church factor resident in boston when i was a boy he had bought upon speculation a connecticut cargo of onions which he flattered himself he might sell again to great profit but the price fell and they lay upon hand he was heartily vexed with his bargain especially when he observed they began to grow in the store he had filled with them he showed them one day to a friend here they are said he and they are growing too i damn them every    day but i think they are like the presbyterians the more i curse them the more they grow yours b franklin benjamin franklin    may      passy george whately mcccxli to george

yours most affectionately b franklin count de vergennes    may      versailles benjamin franklin mcccxlii from count de vergennes versailles    may      sir— i have learned with much concern of your retiring and of your approaching departure for america you cannot doubt but that the regrets which you will leave will be proportionate to the consideration you so justly enjoy i can assure you sir that the esteem the king entertains for you does not leave you any thing to wish and that his majesty will learn with real satisfaction    that your fellowcitizens have rewarded in a manner worthy of you the important services that you have rendered them i beg sir that you will preserve for me a share in your remembrance and never doubt the sincerity of the interest i take in your happiness it is founded on the sentiments of attachment of which i have assured you and with which i have the honor to be etc de vergennes benjamin franklin    may      passy george whately mcccxliii to george whately passy    may      dear old friend— i sent you a few lines the other day with my medallion when i should have written more but was prevented by the coming in of a bavard who worried me till evening i bore with him and now you are to bear with me for i shall probably bavarder in answering your letter i am not acquainted with the saying of alphonsus which you allude to as a sanctification of your rigidity in refusing to allow me the plea of old age as an excuse for my want of exactness in correspondence what was that saying you do not it seems feel any occasion for such an excuse though you are as you say rising seventyfive but i am rising perhaps more properly falling eighty and i leave the excuse with you till you arrive at that age perhaps you may then be more sensible of its validity and see fit to use it for yourself    i must agree with you that the gout is bad and that the stone is worse i am happy in not having them both together and i join in your prayer that you may live till you die without either but i doubt the author of the epitaph you send me was a little mistaken when he speaking of the world says that   he neer cared a pin   what they said or may say of the mortal within it is so natural to wish to be well spoken of whether alive or dead that i imagine he could not be quite exempt from that desire and that at least he wished to be thought a wit or he would not have given himself the trouble of writing so good an epitaph to leave behind him was it not as worthy of his care that the world should say he was an honest and a good man i like better the concluding sentiment in the old song called the old mans wish wherein after wishing for a warm house in a country town an easy horse some good authors ingenious and cheerful companions a pudding on sundays with stout ale and a bottle of burgundy etc etc in separate stanzas each ending with this burthen   may i govern my passions with absolute sway   grow wiser and better as my strength wears away   without gout or stone by a gentle decay he adds   with a courage undaunted may i face the last day   and when i am gone may the better sort say   in the morning when sober in the evening when mellow   he s gone and has not left behind him his fellow   for he governed his passions etc    but what signifies our wishing things happen after all as they will happen i have sung that wishing song a thousand times when i was young and now find at fourscore that the three contraries have befallen me—being subject to the gout and the stone and not being yet master of all my passions like the proud girl in the country who wished and resolved not to marry a parson nor a presbyterian nor an irishman and at length found herself married to an irish presbyterian parson you see i have some reason to wish that in a future state i may not only be as well as i was but a little better and i hope it for i too with your poet trust in god and when i observe that there is great frugality as well as wisdom in his works since he has been evidently sparing both of labor and materials for by the various inventions of propagation he has provided for the continual peopling his world with plants and animals without being at the trouble of repeated new creations and by the natural reduction of compound substances to their original elements capable of being employed in new compositions he has prevented the necessity of creating new matter so that the earth water air and perhaps fire which being compounded from wood do when the wood is dissolved return and again become air earth fire and water—i say that when i see nothing annihilated and not even a drop of water wasted i cannot suspect the annihilation of souls or believe that he will suffer the daily waste of millions of minds ready made that now exist and put himself to the continual trouble of making new ones thus finding    myself to exist in the world i believe i shall in some shape or other always exist and with all the inconveniences human life is liable to i shall not object to a new edition of mine hoping however that the errata of the last may be corrected i return your note of children received in the foundling hospital at paris from      to      inclusive and i have added the years succeeding down to    0 those since that period i have not been able to obtain i have noted in the margin the gradual increase viz from every tenth child so thrown upon the public till it comes to every third fifteen years have passed since the last account and probably it may now amount to one half is it right to encourage this monstrous deficiency of natural affection a surgeon i met with here excused the women of paris by saying seriously that they could not give suck car said he elles nont point de tetons he assured me it was a fact and bade me look at them and observe how flat they were on the breast they have nothing more there said he than i have upon the back of my hand i have since thought that there might be some truth in his observation and that possibly nature finding they made no use of bubbies has left off giving them any yet since rousseau pleaded with admirable eloquence for the rights of children to their mothers milk the mode has changed a little and some ladies of quality now suckle their infants and find milk enough may the mode descend to the lower ranks till it becomes no longer the custom to pack their infants away as soon as born to the enfans trouvés    with the careless observation that the king is better able to maintain them i am credibly informed that nine tenths of them die there pretty soon which is said to be a great relief to the institution whose funds would not otherwise be sufficient to bring up the remainder except the few persons of quality above mentioned and the multitude who send to the hospital the practice is to hire nurses in the country to carry out the children and take care of them there here is an office for examining the health of nurses and giving them licenses they come to town on certain days of the week in companies to receive the children and we often meet trains of them on the road returning to the neighboring villages with each a child in her arms but those who are good enough to try this way of raising their children are often not able to pay the expense so that the prisons are crowded with wretched fathers and mothers confined pour mois de nourrice though it is laudably a favorite charity to pay for them and set such prisoners at liberty i wish success to the new project of assisting the poor to keep their children at home because i think there is no nurse like a mother or not many and that if parents did not immediately send their infants out of sight they would in a few days begin to love them and thence be spurred to greater industry for their maintenance this is a subject you understand better than i and therefore having perhaps said too much i drop it i only add to the notes a remark from the history of the academy of sciences much in favor of the foundling institution    the philadelphia bank goes on as i hear very well what you call the cincinnati institution is no institution of our government but a private convention among the officers of our late army and so universally disliked by the people that it is supposed it will be dropped it was considered as an attempt to establish something like an hereditary rank or nobility i hold with you that it was wrong may i add that all descending honors are wrong and absurd that the honor of virtuous actions appertains only to him that performs them and is in its nature incommunicable if it were communicable by descent it must also be divisible among the descendants and the more ancient the family the less would be found existing in any one branch of it to say nothing of the greater chance of unlucky interruptions  our constitution seems not to be well understood with you if the congress were a permanent body there would be more reason in being jealous of giving it powers but its members are chosen annually cannot be chosen more than three years successively nor more than three years in seven and any of them may be recalled at any time whenever their constituents shall be dissatisfied with their conduct  they are of the people and return again to mix with the people having no more durable preeminence than the different grains of sand in an hourglass such an assembly cannot easily become dangerous to liberty they are the servants of the people sent together to do the peoples business and promote the    public welfare their powers must be sufficient or their duties cannot be performed they have no profitable appointments but a mere payment of daily wages such as are scarcely equivalent to their expenses so that having no chance for great places and enormous salaries or pensions as in some countries there is no canvassing or bribing for elections i wish old england were as happy in its government but i do not see it your people however think their constitution the best in the world and affect to despise ours it is comfortable to have a good opinion of ones self and of every thing that belongs to us to think ones own religion king and wife the best of all possible wives kings or religions i remember three greenlanders who had travelled two years in europe under the care of some moravian missionaries and had visited germany denmark holland and england when i asked them at philadelphia where they were on their way home whether now they had seen how much more commodiously the white people lived by the help of the arts they would not choose to remain among us their answer was that they were pleased with having an opportunity of seeing so many fine things but they chose to live in their own country which country by the way consisted of rock only for the moravians were obliged to carry earth in their ship from new york for the purpose of making a cabbage garden by mr dollands saying that my double spectacles can only serve particular eyes i doubt he has not been rightly informed of their construction i imagine it will be found pretty generally true that  0 the same convexity of glass through which a man sees clearest and best at the distance proper for reading is not the best for greater distances i therefore had formerly two pair of spectacles which i shifted occasionally as in travelling i sometimes read and often wanted to regard the prospects finding this change troublesome and not always sufficiently ready i had the glasses cut and half of each kind associated in the same circle by this means as i wear my spectacles constantly i have only to move my eyes up or down as i want to see distinctly far or near the proper glasses being always ready this i find more particularly convenient since my being in france the glasses that serve me best at table to see what i eat not being the best to see the faces of those on the other side of the table who speak to me and when ones ears are not well accustomed to the sounds of a language a sight of the movements in the features of him that speaks helps to explain so that i understand french better by the help of my spectacles my intended translator of your piece the only one i know who understands the subject as well as the two languages which a translator ought to do or he cannot make so good a translation is at present occupied in an affair that prevents his undertaking it but that will soon be over i thank you for the notes i should be glad to have another of the printed pamphlets we shall always be ready to take your children if you send them to us i only wonder that since london draws to itself and consumes such numbers    of country people the country should not to supply their places want and willingly receive the children you have to dispose of that circumstance together with the multitude who voluntarily part with their freedom as men to serve for a time as lackeys or for life as soldiers in consideration of small wages seems to me proof that your island is overpeopled and yet it is afraid of emigrations adieu my dear friend and believe me ever yours very affectionately b franklin thomas percival    may      manchester benjamin franklin mcccxliv from thomas percival manchester    may      dear sir— i owe you my most cordial acknowledgments for the very friendly letter with which you favored me last summer by mr smeathman your ingenious manuscript concerning the cause of the severe cold in the winter of        i delivered to our philosophical society and it is ordered by the committee on papers to be inserted in a volume of memoirs which is now in the press i am commissioned to return the thanks of the society to you for this communication to request your future correspondence and to acquaint you that we have honored our institution by electing you an extraordinary member the gentleman who took charge of your diploma conveys it with a little tract of mine on the perceptive power of vegetables to the whimsical doctrine    contained in this jeu desprit you will readily believe i can hardly be a convert yet the further we carry our researches into the comparative nature of animals and vegetables the more shall we find that they elucidate the economy of each other and reciprocally discover principles which are common to both late observations have evinced that animals have the power of resisting to a certain point such degrees of heat or cold as are injurious to them it is obvious that vegetables must be endued with the same faculty because they are found to flourish in climates where the circumambient air varies considerably from their proper temperature and the fact has been fully illustrated by mr john hunters experiments your very kind acceptance of the volume of moral and literary dissertations which i sent to you by mr thomas white afforded me the sincerest satisfaction and the honor you did me by perusing the whole of it before you slept is more flattering to me than the approbation of a hundred critics i have lately received a very valuable present from my friend dr watson bishop of landaff it is a collection of tracts on the evidences of natural and revealed religion selected from the works of churchmen laymen and dissenters systematically arranged in six octavo volumes so as to form a complete library for the junior and inferior clergy i am charmed with the candor the liberality and the spirit of catholicism which his lordship has avowed with the utmost energy and freedom in his preface the true christian charity of a bishop thus manifested    will promote the interest of the church of england far more honorably and permanently than creeds tests or anathemas he has proved himself the generous minister of peace and if his brethren follow so laudable an example by offering the olive branch instead of brandishing the sword or throwing down the gauntlet i hope and trust an end will be put to theological contention and hostility is there any prospect of your revisiting england few events would give me more delight than to have an opportunity of assuring you in person with what cordial esteem and respect i have the honor to be dear sir etc thomas percival richard price   june      newington green benjamin franklin mcccxlv from richard price newington green   june      my dear friend— i wrote to you and mr jefferson a few weeks ago and sent you some copies of the edition lately published here of my pamphlet on the american revolution mr williams has given me much pleasure by calling upon me and bringing me a letter from you i have according to your desire furnished him with a list of such books on religion and government as i think some of the best and added a present to the parish that is to bear your name of such of my own publications as i think may not be unsuitable should this be the commencement of parochial libraries in the states it will do great good    mr williams tells me that you have obtained permission to resign and that you are likely soon to return to america there to finish your life a life which without doubt will be one of the most distinguished in future annals indeed i cannot wonder that after being so long tossed on the sea of politics and seeing your country partly under your guidance carried through a hard contest and a most important revolution established you should wish to withdraw to rest and tranquillity may the best blessings of heaven attend you and the sad malady under which you are suffering be rendered as tolerable to you as possible you are going to the new world i must stay in this but i trust there is a world beyond the grave where we shall be happier than ever i shall be always following you with my good wishes and remain with unalterable respect and affection etc richard price claudius crigan   june      benjamin franklin mcccxlvi from claudius crigan bishop of sodor and man isle of man   june      the name of dr franklin stands so high in politics and philosophy that it were a proof of the depth of ignorance and obscurity to be unacquainted with the great things he has done in both these useful sciences europe as well as america looks with equal veneration and admiration on the great man who supported an oppressed and almost sinking    state and forsook her not until he secured her freedom and established her independence among the sovereigns of the world some of these few who have had the happiness of a personal acquaintance with him have assured me they found him as willing to communicate his knowledge as he had been studious to obtain it and that no one could leave him without carrying away some improvement and receiving the most pleasing entertainment when crowns court attention it is scarcely decent for common people to solicit admission but a mr hamilton of ireland and some other friends of mine have given me such accounts of your condescension that i am emboldened to give you this trouble and to presume so far as to entreat the liberty of introducing my vicargeneral the reverend mr christian to you and as we have lately received some imperfect sketches of the establishment of the episcopal church of england in the southern colonies of north america should mr christian request any information from you or propose any thing for the benefit of religion in that quarter of the world you may depend with the greatest safety on his talents and intelligence in church business as well as his sincerity in assisting me in executing any part in the system he may have the honor of proposing to you i shall consider a few lines in acknowledgment of your forgiveness of this intrusion of myself and my friend upon you as the greatest honor of my life and remain with the most profound respect your most obedient servant claudius sodor and man    mcccxlvii on the elective franchises enjoyed by the small boroughs in england  no man or body of men in any nation can have a just right to any privilege or franchise not common to the rest of the nation without having done the nation some service equivalent for which the franchise or privilege was the recompense or consideration no man or body of men can be justly deprived of a common right but for some equivalent offence or injury done to the society in which he enjoyed that right if a number of men are unjustly deprived of a common right and the same is given in addition to the common rights of another number who have not merited such addition the injustice is double few if any of the boroughs in england ever performed any such particular service to the nation entitling them to what they now claim as a privilege in elections originally in england when the king issued his writs of calling upon the counties cities and boroughs to depute persons who should meet him in parliament the intention was to obtain by that    means more perfect information of the general state of the kingdom its faculties strength and disposition together with the advice their accumulated wisdom might afford him in such arduous affairs of the realm as he had to propose and he might reasonably hope that measures approved by the deputies in such an assembly would on their return home be by them well explained and rendered agreeable to their constituents and the nation in general at that time being sent to parliament was not considered as being put into the way of preferment or increase of fortune therefore no bribe was given to obtain the appointment the deputies were to be paid wages by their constituents therefore the being obliged to send and pay was considered rather as a duty than a privilege at this day in new england many towns who may and ought to send members to the assembly sometimes neglect to do it they are then summoned to answer for their neglect and fined if they cannot give a good excuse such as some common misfortune or some extraordinary public expense which disabled them from affording conveniently the necessary wages and the wages allowed being barely sufficient to defray the deputys expense no solicitations are used to be chosen in england as soon as the being sent to parliament was found to be a step towards acquiring both honor and fortune solicitations were practised and where they were insufficient money was given both the ambitious and avaricious became candidates but to solicit the poor laborer for his vote being    humiliating to the proud man and to pay for it hurting the lover of money they when they met joined in an act to diminish both these inconveniences by depriving the poor of the right of voting which certainly they were not empowered to do by the electors their constituents the majority of whom were probably people of little property the act was therefore not only unjust but void these lower people were immediately afterwards oppressed by another act empowering the justices to fix the hire of daylaborers and their hours of work and to send them to the house of correction if they refused to work for such hire which was deposing them from their condition of freemen and making them literally slaves but this was taking from many freemen a common right and confirming it to a few to give it back again to the many is a different operation of this the few have no just cause to complain because they still retain the common right they always had and lose only the exclusive additional power which they ought never to have had and if they used it when they had it as a means of obtaining money they should in justice were it practicable be obliged to refund and distribute such money among those who had been so unjustly deprived of their right of voting or forfeit it to the public corporations therefore or boroughs who from being originally called to send deputies to parliament when it was considered merely as a duty and not as a particular privilege and therefore was never purchased by any equivalent service to the public    continue to send now that by a change of times it affords them profit in bribes or emoluments of various kinds have in reality no right to such advantages which are besides in effect prejudicial to the nation some of those who buy thinking they may sell they should therefore in justice be immediately deprived of such pretended right and reduced to the condition of common freemen but they are perhaps too strong and their interest too weighty to permit such justice to be done and a regard for public good in these people influencing a voluntary resignation is not to be expected if that be the case it may be necessary to submit to the power of present circumstances passions and prejudices and purchase since we can do no better their consent as men when they cannot otherwise recover property unjustly detained from them advertise a reward to whoever will restore it promising that no questions shall be asked benjamin franklin    june      paris thomas barclay mcccxlviii to thomas barclay paris    june      sir— with respect to my continuing to charge two thousand five hundred pounds sterling per annum as my salary of which you desire some explanation i send you in support of that charge the resolution of congress which is in these words  0 in congress october        resolved that each of the ministers plenipotentiary be allowed at the rate of two thousand five hundred pounds sterling per annum and each of their secretaries at the rate of one thousand pounds sterling per annum in full for their services and expenses respectively that the salary of each of the said officers be computed from the time of his leaving his place of abode to enter on the duties of his office and be continued three months after the notice of his recall the several bills i afterwards received drawn on the congress banker mr grand for my salary were all calculated on that sum as my salary and neither the banker nor myself have received notice of any change respecting me he has accordingly since the drawing ceased continued to pay me at the same rate i have indeed heard that a resolution was passed last year that the salaries of plenipotentiaries should be no more than two thousand pounds sterling per annum but the resolution i suppose can relate only to such plenipotentiaries as should be afterwards appointed for i cannot conceive that the congress after promising a minister twentyfive hundred pounds a year and when he has thereby been encouraged to engage in a way of living for their honor which only that salary can support would think it just to diminish it a fifth and leave him under the difficulty of reducing his expenses proportionably a thing scarce practicable the necessity of which he might have avoided if he had not confided in their original promise but the article of salary with all the rest of my    accounts will be submitted to the judgment of congress together with some other considerable articles i have not charged but on which i shall expect from their equity some consideration if for want of knowing precisely the intention of congress what expenses should be deemed public and what private i have charged any article to the public which should be defrayed by me their banker has my order as soon as the pleasure of congress shall be made known to him to rectify the error by transferring the amount to my private account and discharging by so much that of the public i have the honor to be etc b franklin benjamin franklin  0 june      passy mcccxlix to ——— passy  0 june      dear sir— i have just received the only letter from you that has given me pain it informs me of your intention to attempt passing to england in the car of a balloon in the present imperfect state of that invention i think it much too soon to hazard a voyage of that distance it is said here by some of those who have had experience that as yet they have not found means to keep up a balloon more than two hours for that by now and then losing air to prevent rising too high and bursting and now and then discharging ballast to avoid descending too low these means of regulation are exhausted besides this all the circumstances of danger by disappointment    in the operation of soupapes etc etc seem not to be yet well known and therefore not easily provided against for on wednesday last m pilâtre de rosier who had studied the subject as much as any man lost his support in the air by the bursting of his balloon or by some other means we are yet

pardon the anxious freedom of a friend if he tells you that the continuance of your life being of importance to your family and your country though you might laudably hazard it for their good you have no right to risk it for a fancy i pray god this may reach you in time and have some effect towards changing your design being ever my dear friend yours affectionately b franklin benjamin franklin    june      passy francis maseres mcccl to francis maseres passy    june      sir— i have just received your friendly letter of the  0th instant i agree with you perfectly in the opinion that though the contest has been hurtful to both our countries yet the event a separation is better even for yours than success the reducing and    keeping us in subjection by an armed force would have cost you more than the dominion could be worth and our slavery would have brought on yours the ancient system of the british empire was a happy one by which the colonies were allowed to govern and tax themselves had it been wisely continued it is hard to imagine the degree of power and importance in the world that empire might have arrived at all the means of growing greatness extent of territory agriculture commerce arts population were within its own limits and therefore at its command i used to consider that system as a large and beautiful porcelain vase i lamented the measures that i saw likely to break it and strove to prevent them because once broken i saw no probability of its being ever repaired my endeavors did not succeed we are broken and the parts must now do as well as they can for themselves we may still do well though separated i have great hopes of our side and good wishes for yours the anarchy and confusion you mention as supposed to prevail among us exist only in your newspapers i have authentic accounts which assure me that no people were ever better governed or more content with their respective constitutions and governments than the present thirteen states of america a little reflection may convince any reasonable man that a government wherein the administrators are chosen annually by the free voice of the governed and may also be recalled at any time if their conduct displeases their constituents cannot be a tyrannical    one as your loyalists represent it who at the same time inconsistently desire to return and live under it and among an intelligent enlightened people as ours is there must always be too numerous and too strong a party for supporting good government and the laws to suffer what is called anarchy this better account of our situation must be pleasing to your humanity and therefore i give it you but we differ a little in our sentiments respecting the loyalists as they call themselves and the conduct of america towards them which you think seems actuated by a spirit of revenge and that it would have been more agreeable to policy as well as justice to have restored their estates upon their taking the oaths of allegiance to the new governments that there should still be some resentment against them in the breasts of those who have had their houses farms and towns so lately destroyed and relations scalped under the conduct of these royalists is not wonderful though i believe the opposition given by many to their reestablishing among us is owing to a firm persuasion that there could be no reliance on their oaths and that the effect of receiving those people again would be an introduction of that very anarchy and confusion they falsely reproach us with even the example you propose of the english commonwealths restoring the estates of the royalists after their being subdued seems rather to countenance and encourage our acting differently as probably if the power which always accompanies property had not been restored to the royalists if their estates had remained confiscated and their persons    had been banished they could not have so much contributed to the restoration of kingly power and the new government of the republic might have been more durable the majority of examples in your history are on the other side of the question all the estates in england and south of scotland and most of those possessed by the descendants of the english in ireland are held from ancient confiscations made of the estates of caledonians and britons the original possessors in your island or the native irish in the last century only it is but a few months since that your parliament has in a few instances given up confiscations incurred by a rebellion suppresed forty years ago the war against us was begun by a general act of parliament declaring all our estates confiscated and probably one great motive to the loyalty of the royalists was the hope of sharing in these confiscations they have played a deep game staking their estates against ours and they have been unsuccessful but it is a surer game since they had promises to rely on from your government of indemnification in case of loss and i see your parliament is about to fulfil those promises to this i have no objection because though still our enemies they are men they are in necessity and i think even a hired assassin has a right to his pay from his employer it seems too more reasonable that the expense of paying these should fall upon the government who encouraged the mischief done rather than upon us who suffered it the confiscated estates making amends but for a very small part of that mischief it is not    therefore clear that our retaining them is chargeable with injustice i have hinted above that the name loyalist was improperly assumed by these people royalists they may perhaps be called but the true loyalists were the people of america against whom they acted no people were ever known more truly loyal and universally so to their sovereigns the protestant succession in the house of hanover was their idol not a jacobite was to be found from one end of the colonies to the other they were affectionate to the people of england zealous and forward to assist in her wars by voluntary contributions of men and money even beyond their proportion the king and parliament had frequently acknowledged this by public messages resolutions and reimbursements but they were equally fond of what they esteemed their rights and if they resisted when those were attacked it was a resistance in favor of a british constitution which every englishman might share in enjoying who should come to live among them it was resisting arbitrary impositions that were contrary to common right and to their fundamental constitutions and to constant ancient usage it was indeed a resistance in favor of the liberties of england which might have been endangered by success in the attempt against ours and therefore a great man in your parliament  did not scruple to declare he rejoiced that america had resisted i for the same reason may add this very resistance to the other instances of their loyalty i have already said that    i think it just you should reward those americans who joined your troops in the war against their own country but if ever honesty could be inconsistent with policy it is so in this instance i am etc b franklin benjamin franklin    june      passy mary hewson mcccli to mrs mary hewson passy    june      dear friend— i wrote to you the  th of last month and have since received

things are now packed up and will be in the barge next wednesday to go down the river for though i know not yet what vessel i shall go in i would have every thing at havre ready to embark and i suppose i shall not be here myself a fortnight longer i say nothing to persuade you to go with me or to follow me because i know you do not usually act from persuasion but from judgment and as that is very sound i leave you to yourself you will do what is best for you and yours and that will give me most pleasure miss lamottes friends do not consent to her going to england i enclose her letter by which you will see that though she speaks the language prettily she does not write it correctly indeed abundance of the french are deficient in their    own orthography i offered her as you desired the money that might be necessary for the journey temple is not yet quite well having had several returns of his ague benjamin continues hearty and has been very serviceable in packing they both present their respects if you should write me a line before my departure direct it to havre de grâce adieu my very dear friend and believe me ever yours with sincerest respect and affection b franklin

cannot let mr franklin your son visit you in france without certifying my sincere good wishes on your leaving europe that you may arrive safe and long enjoy your health in america  you will arrive there deservedly covered with the glory of having had a large share in bringing about an event which i wish had not become necessary for the welfare of two great divisions of the english nation or that when it became so it had been brought about with less profusion of blood and treasure but    the frame of human nature is inseparable from passions that produce calamities which the species will never be free from it is however the part of the wise and good to afford that assistance to the species which wisdom only can and goodness only will give i know i have no occasion to exhort you to this good work but i have pleasure in assuring you that i rely on the weight of your authority for establishing the opinion that it is not only the interest of great britain and america to live upon good terms with one another but that this friendship is perfectly compatible with a mutual friendship between france and both of them for my part i entertain no apprehensions from the supposed ambition of that kingdom it has frequently given proofs of its desire to preserve the peace of europe one very recent and except in the east indies the two kingdoms seem to have nothing to quarrel about i except the east indies not because i think that either have any interest inconsistent with the interest of the other but because i think it most likely that one or the other may there mistake its interest sure i am that it is the interest of great britain to make the trade of france perfectly easy there and with such a secure and easy trade i wish great britain could change situations with her ancient rival dominion at such a distance and in a country where despotism seems the natural growth of the climate cannot be well and it cannot but in the end be mischievous to the state that possesses it however the wealth it produces may force for a time the appearance of affluence at home an  0 affluence that may aid pernicious measures but at last must be destructive in its consequences i cannot take my leave of you without congratulating you on the benefaction conferred on mankind by m necker i have read more than once his excellent work and some of the concluding chapters with ecstasy and tears i flatter myself that the princes of the earth will read it and that some of them will be affected as i have been and perhaps some of their ministers i need not say that many of his thoughts have been yours and my own though i have never been able to express them with the elegance he has done  in      and      i gave to lord north two or three sheets in the former year on the subject of money in the latter on that of peace the opinions therein contained i now find confirmed by an authority that i respect without bounds i am my dear sir your affectionate

light and in which at every step we meet monuments consecrated to your discoveries during the last years of my residence at paris my heart often beat with joy when i had an opportunity of joining my applause to that which all france seemed to think due to you wherever you appeared i am still more happy at this time since i am requested in the name of my fellowcitizens to add one modest flower to the wreaths with which you are crowned and am allowed the personal gratification of offering to you the homage of my profound veneration the academy has directed me to send to you the list of its

franklin   july      passy claudius crigan mccclvi to claudius crigan bishop of sodor and man passy   july      my lord— i received the too complaisant letter your lordship did me the honor of writing to me by the reverend mr christian who has also communicated some of your views for the benefit of religion in the united states of america requesting my opinion which i have given him but will repeat in    this letter lest i should not in every particular have been rightly apprehended it is proper to be understood that those states consist of thirteen distinct and separate sovereignties each governed by its own laws in which no one religious sect is established as predominant but there is a general toleration of all and should any thing be enacted by one of them in favor of a particular sect it would have no operation in the others the congress though formed by delegates from each state chosen annually has powers extending only to those affairs of political government that relate to the whole but no authority whatever is given to them in ecclesiastical matters and i therefore think they will do nothing either to encourage or discourage the introduction of a bishop in america for myself i can only say as a private person that i think such an officer may be of use to the episcopalians not only for the better government of their clergy but for preventing the expense and risk that attend the sending of their young men to england for ordination he should however have power to consecrate other bishops so as to prevent for ever the necessity of sending to england for successors in that station otherwise he will hardly be so well received the great difficulty will be to make proper provision for his support i doubt whether any of the governments will establish such support and i have not much confidence that any thing considerable may be obtained by private contributions my reasons are that the episcopalians in most of the states are very small in number compared with the inhabitants    of other persuasions and where they are a majority they do not generally see the necessity or utility of a resident bishop and they apprehend some inconvenience in it of this there was a strong instance in virginia some years before the late revolution the inhabitants of that province were almost wholly of the church of england and their house of commons of course the same yet that house unanimously censured in strong terms the proposition of some of their own clergy for introducing a bishop and thanked others who opposed and defeated the project as may be seen in the following extract from their journal friday july         resolved nemine contradicente that the thanks of this house be given to the reverend mr henley the reverend mr gwatkin the reverend mr hewit and the reverend mr bland for the wise and welltimed opposition they have made to the pernicious project of a few mistaken clergymen for introducing an american bishop a measure by which much disturbance great anxiety and apprehension would certainly take place among his majestys faithful american subjects and that mr richard henry lee and mr bland do acquaint them therewith the apprehension mentioned in the resolve i imagine must have been an apprehension of expense to maintain a bishop suitable to his dignity and of attempts to oblige the laity to defray such expense by taxes or tithes or at least of their being solicited for voluntary contributions there being at present no fund appointed for such purpose nor any thing    hitherto given but a farm by legacy in rhode island if however the laity should have changed their minds and wish now to have a bishop whom they would engage to support by voluntary contributions in that case i imagine none of the governments would forbid it but the support would probably be too small and too precarious to be a sufficient encouragement mr christian asked my opinion whether your making a tour incognito through the country might not be a prudent measure whatever prospect or hope there may be of your greater usefulness to religion in our extensive country than in the little isle of man yet as you have a family i certainly cannot advise your making any hasty application to your government for your removal or taking any step that may hazard the loss of a present sure support against a contingent future and precarious therefore to enable yourself to form a better judgment it might be well to see with your own eyes the state of things and sound the disposition of the people but i am nevertheless inclined to think that in making the tour you will hardly be encouraged to attempt the change unless the society for propagating the gospel or the british government would fix a sufficient income to be paid you from england such a journey may however contribute to establish health as well as pleasingly gratify the curiosity of seeing the progress which the arts agriculture science and industry are making in a new country with great respect i have the honor to be etc b franklin    benjamin franklin   july      passy granville sharp mccclvii to granville sharp passy   july      dear sir— i received the books you were so kind as to send me by mr drown please to accept my hearty thanks your writings which always have some public good for their object i always read with pleasure i am perfectly of your opinion with respect to the salutary law of gavelkind and hope it may in time be established throughout america in six of the states already the lands of intestates are divided equally among the children if all girls but there is a double share given to the eldest son for which i see no more reason than giving such share to the eldest daughter and i think there should be no distinction since my being last in france i have seen several of our eldest sons spending idly their fortunes by residing in europe and neglecting their own country these are from the southern states the northern young men stay at home and are industrious useful citizens the more equal division of their fathers fortunes not enabling them to ramble and spend their shares abroad which is so much the better for their country i like your piece on the election of bishops there is a fact in holinsheds chronicles the latter part relating to scotland which shows if my memory does not deceive me that the first bishop in that country was elected by the clergy i mentioned it some time past in a letter to two young men  who asked my advise about obtaining ordination which    had been denied them by the bishops in england unless they would take the oath of allegiance to the king and i said i imagine that unless a bishop is soon sent over with power to consecrate others so that we may have no future occasion for applying to england for ordination we may think it right after reading your piece to elect also the liturgy you mention was an abridgment of that made by a noble lord of my acquaintance who requested me to assist him by taking the rest of the book viz the catechism and the reading and singing psalms these i abridged by retaining of the catechism only the two questions what is your duty to god what is your duty to your neighbor with answers the psalms were much contracted by leaving out the repetitions of which i found more than i could have imagined and the imprecations which appeared not to suit well the christian doctrine of forgiveness of injuries and doing good to enemies the book was printed for wilkie in st pauls churchyard but never much noticed some were given away very few sold and i suppose the bulk became waste paper in the prayers so much was retrenched that approbation could hardly be expected but i think with you a moderate abridgment might not only be useful but generally acceptable i am now on the point of departing for america where i shall be glad occasionally to hear from you and of your welfare being with sincere and great esteem dear sir your most

renewed assurance of the most entire consideration    with which i have the honor to be sir your very humble and very obedient servant de castries benjamin franklin    july      st germain mary hewson mccclxi to mrs mary hewson st germain twelve miles from paris    july         i left passy yesterday afternoon and am here on my way to havre de grâce a seaport in order to embark for america i make use of one of the kings litters carried by mules which walk steadily and easily so that i bear the motion very well i am to be taken on board a philadelphia ship on the coast of england captain truxtun the beginning of next month not having written to you since the letter which contained a bill on mount vernon and as i may not have another opportunity before my arrival in philadelphia if it pleases god i do arrive i write these particulars to go by way of england that you may be less uneasy about me i did my last public act in this country just before i set out which was signing a treaty of amity and commerce with prussia i have continued to work till late in the day it is time i should go home and go to bed    jonathan shipley    july      twyford benjamin franklin mccclxii from jonathan shipley bishop of st asaph twyford    july      my ever dear friend— the first emotion of my heart is to thank heaven that you are once more so    near me and that i shall have the happiness of seeing you in a few hours some of our good friends are come most untimely to dine with us as soon as we are rid of them my wife and i and the only daughter that is now with us will hasten to welcome you and to enjoy till the last moment of your departure as much of the blessing of your conversation as we can without being tiresome adieu till seven or eight in the evening i will leave directions to hasten mr williams ever yours j st asaph benjamin franklin    july      southampton benjamin vaughan mccclxiii to benjamin vaughan southampton   oclock am    july      my very dear friend— i am this minute arrived here with my family from havre de grâce and shall stay here till captain truxtun arrives at cowes to take us in  i write this line just to inform you that i bore the journey to havre in one of the kings litters very well and the voyage also from thence hither in fortyfive hours though the wind was a great part of the time contrary i shall be glad of a line from you acquainting me whether you ever received two pieces i sent you some months since one on your penal laws the other an account of the residence of an english seaman in china  as you commonly    said something to me concerning the things i used to send you i apprehend you either have not received these or do not like them if you have any thing to say by me to your friends in america send it and i will take care to deliver it adieu my dearest friend i am ever yours b franklin benjamin franklin    july      southampton limozin mccclxiv to mr limozin southampton    july      sir— we arrived here on sunday morning about   oclock i was not in the least incommoded by the voyage but my children and my friend mr veillard were very sick i have just learned that our ship was at gravesend the   d and expected to be in the downs yesterday and therefore may be here sooner than was at first proposed so that i have now no hopes of the goods being here in time to go in her i therefore hereby desire you would forward them to new york in the packet in case a packet sails from havre next month as has been proposed and you have no vessel to sail directly for philadelphia the packets are indeed by the original regulations not allowed to take heavy goods upon freight but i am persuaded mr ruellan will at your request obtain the permission i write to mr grand to pay your account against me for disbursements and commission and i desire you besides to accept my thankful acknowledgments    my best wishes attend you and your amiable daughter being with great regard sir your most obedient and most humble servant b franklin benjamin franklin    july      southampton m ruellan mccclxv to mr ruellan southampton    july      dear sir— we arrived here yesterday morning about   oclock i was not in the least incommoded by the voyage but m le veillard and my grandsons were all very sick upon the passage though now recovered and well capt jennings staying here till tomorrow morning and having heard since my coming here that the ship has sailed from london i begin to fear it will be impossible for him to return in time with the rest of my baggage supposing it to be now at havre i have forwarded your letter of credit to messrs thellusson and asked them to give me a credit here for fifty guineas if i should want so much but as my stay is like to be very short i know not yet whether i shall have occasion to make any use of it i am nevertheless extremely sensible of the kindness and generosity of your proceeding in that letter as well as in every other point of your friendly entertainment and good offices at havre and the provision you laid in for us i can at present only offer in return my thankful acknowledgments requesting that if at any time i can be of any use to you in    america or to any friend of yours you would be so good as to command me freely be pleased to present my respectful compliments to good mme ruellan i hope the children are better i write to mr limozin desiring him to forward my goods by the packet in case the next sails from havre as has been said and no vessel offers sooner that goes directly to philadelphia if i remember right the regulations of the packets forbid their taking heavy goods but i suppose you may be able to obtain permission for mine which will be an additional favor with great esteem etc b franklin benjamin franklin    july      southampton m holker mccclxvi to mr holker southampton    july      my dear friend— i know it will give you and good mrs holker pleasure to learn that we arrived safe and well here yesterday morning neither the journey by land nor the voyage by sea having incommoded me in the least i have given you abundance of trouble with my little affairs and am loth to give you any more but cannot well avoid requesting you would be so kind as to show the enclosed account to mr garvey when he returns to rouen and represent to him that the charge his nephew makes of commissions three livres a box only for the care of having my     boxes moved out of one boat into    another appears to me exorbitant amounting to   0 livres near as much as the expense of bringing them from paris to rouen and three times as much as has been demanded of me for their freight between havre and cowes loading and discharging included if mr garvey confirms the charge which i think he hardly will let him say so at the bottom of the account and then send it with this letter to mr grand whom i hereby desire and authorize to pay it because i would not leave any just claim upon me remaining in france though i should wish to know if there are any circumstances i am unacquainted with that can make such charge appear reasonable god bless you both my dear friends and believe me ever with a heart deeply sensible of all your kindness yours most affectionately b franklin benjamin franklin    july      southampton m grand mccclxvii to mr grand southampton    july      dear sir— i wrote a few lines to you per post yesterday morning to acquaint you with my arrival here not in the least incommoded by the journey and voyage but rather better than i have been for a long time past our goods that were sent down the river had not arrived at havre when we left that place and as i learn here that our ship was at gravesend the   d    and expected to be in the downs yesterday evening she may be here tomorrow so that i now almost despair of getting them at cowes in time to go in her and they must be forwarded in the august packet if that sails from havre or wait some other opportunity to me the disappointment will not be much as the things i most immediately want came down by the roulier and are with me but mr houdon will be at a loss for his clay etc mr limozin has the care of receiving and forwarding our things but the business not being finished i could not settle the account with him but have directed him to exhibit it to you and i desire you would pay it the person who manages mr garveys business in his absence has made a heavy charge against me as his commission i have sent the account to mr holker desiring he would show it to mr garvey on his return and acquaint him that i think that charge enormous but if he confirms it then to send the account to you with my letter in which i desire you to pay it to assist my grandson in a purchase he is making of his father now here perhaps i may draw on you in favor of the father for fortyeight thousand livres at thirty days sight in which case i would have you to sell six of my actions of the caisse descompte and add to the produce of that sale as much out of the balance of my account now in your hands as will make up the sum of fortyeight thousand livres my best wishes attend you and yours being with sincere esteem dear sir your most obliged friend and humble servant b franklin    benjamin franklin    july      southampton mary hewson mccclxviii to mrs mary hewson southampton    july      dear friend— i received here yours of the   d instant i am sorry it did not suit you to go in the ship with me having engaged places in the cabin that would have accommodated you and yours not indeed on your account because i never depended on your going but i took the whole cabin that i might not be intruded on by any accidental disagreeable company if you come to philadelphia you will find an always affectionate friend in me and in my children after i am gone my love to yours and to dolly and my respects to mrs hawkesworth i came to havre de grâce in a litter and hither in the packet boat and instead of being hurt by the journey or voyage i really find myself very much better not having suffered so little for the time these two years past adieu my dear friend accept my repeated thanks for the agreeable winter your kind company with that of my young friends made me pass and believe me ever yours most sincerely and affectionately b franklin benjamin franklin    july      southampton john coakley lettsom mccclxix to dr lettsom southampton    july      dear sir— i received here your kind letter and the valuable present of dr fothergills works for    which please to accept my grateful acknowledgments i purpose on my voyage to write the remaining notes of my life which you desire and to send them to you on my arrival you have done a good deed in contributing to promote science among us by your liberal donation of books to carlisle college thanks for your good wishes in favor of our country and of your friend and servant b franklin benjamin franklin august      david le roy mccclxx to david le roy  at sea on board the london packet captain truxtun august      sir— your learned writings on the navigation of the ancients which contain a great deal of curious information and your very ingenious contrivances for improving the modern sails voilure of which i saw with great pleasure a successful trial on the river seine have induced me to submit to your consideration and judgment some thoughts i have had on the latter subject those mathematicians who have endeavored to improve the swiftness of vessels by calculating to find the form of least resistance seem to have considered a ship as a body moving through one fluid only the water and to have given little attention to the circumstance of her moving through another  0 fluid the air it is true that when a vessel sails right before the wind this circumstance is of no importance because the wind goes with her but in every deviation from that course the resistance of the air is something and becomes greater in proportion as that deviation increases i waive at present the consideration of those different degrees of resistance given by the air to that part of the hull which is above water and confine myself to that given to the sails for their motion through the air is resisted by the air as the motion of the hull through the water is resisted by the water though with less force as the air is a lighter fluid and to simplify the discussion as much as possible i would state one situation only to wit that of the wind upon the beam the ships course being directly across the wind and i would suppose the sail set in an angle of fortyfive degrees with the keel as in the following figure wherein plate i fig   a b represents the body of the vessel c d the position of the sail e e e the direction of the wind m m the line of motion in observing this figure it will appear that so much of the body of the vessel as is immersed in the water must to go forward remove out of its way what water it meets with between the pricked lines f f and the sail to go forward must move out of its way all the air its whole dimension meets with between the pricked lines c g and d g thus both the fluids give resistance to the motion each in proportion to the quantity of matter contained in the dimension to be removed and though the air is vastly lighter e    than the water and therefore more easily removed yet the dimension being much greater its effect is very considerable  it is true that in the case stated the resistance given by the air between those lines to the motion of the sail is not apparent to the eye because the greater force of the wind which strikes it in the direction e e e overpowers its effect and keeps the sail full in the curve a a a a a but suppose the wind to cease and the vessel in a calm to be impelled with the same swiftness by oars the sail would then appear filled in the contrary curve b b b b b when prudent men would immediately perceive that the air resisted its motion and would order it to be taken in is there any possible means of diminishing this resistance while the same quantity of sail is exposed to the action of the wind and therefore the same force obtained from it i think there is and that it may be done by dividing the sail into a number of parts and placing those parts in a line one behind the other thus instead of one sail extending from c to d figure   if four sails containing together the same quantity of canvas were placed as in figure   each having one quarter of the dimensions of the great sail and exposing a quarter of its surface to the wind would give a quarter of the force so that the whole force obtained from the wind would be the same while the resistance from the air would be nearly reduced to the space between the pricked lines a b and c d before the foremost sail    it may perhaps be doubted whether the resistance from the air would be so diminished since possibly each of the following small sails having also air before it which must be removed the resistance on the whole would be the same this is then a matter to be determined by experiment i will mention one that i many years since made with success for another purpose and i will propose another small one easily made if that too succeeds i should think it worth while to make a larger though at some expense on a river boat and perhaps time and the improvements experience will afford may make it applicable with advantage to larger vessels having near my kitchen chimney a round hole of eight inches diameter through which was a strong steady current of air increasing or diminishing only as the fire increased or diminished i contrived to place my jack so as to receive that current and taking off the fliers i fixed in their stead on the same pivot a round tin plate of nearly the same diameter with the hole and having cut it in radial lines almost to the centre so as to have six equal vanes i gave to each of them the obliquity of fortyfive degrees they moved round without the weight by the impression only of the current of air but too slowly for the purpose of roasting i suspected that the air struck by the back of each vane might possibly by its resistance retard the motion and to try this i cut each of them into two and i placed the twelve each having the same obliquity in a line behind each other when i perceived a great augmentation in its    velocity which encouraged me to divide them once more and continuing the same obliquity i placed the twentyfour behind each other in a line when the force of the wind being the same and the surface of vane the same they moved round with much greater rapidity and perfectly answered my purpose the second experiment that i propose is to take two playing cards of the same dimensions and cut one of them transversely into eight equal pieces then with a needle string them upon two threads one near each end and place them so upon the threads that when hung up they may be exactly one over the other at a distance equal to their breadth each in a horizontal position and let a small weight such as a birdshot be hung under them to make them fall in a straight line when let loose suspend also the whole card by threads from its four corners and hang to it an equal weight so as to draw it downwards when let fall its whole breadth pressing against the air let those two bodies be attached one of them to one end of a thread a yard long the other to the other end extend a twine under the ceiling of a room and put through it at thirty inches distance two pins bent in the form of fishhooks on these hooks hang the two bodies the thread that connects them extending parallel to the twine which thread being cut they must begin to fall at the same instant if they take equal time in falling to the floor it is a proof that the resistance of the air is in both cases equal if the whole card requires a longer time it shows that the sum of the resistances    to the pieces of the cut card is not equal to the resistance of the whole one  this principle so far confirmed i would proceed to make a larger experiment with a shallop which i would rig in this manner plate i fig   a b is a long boom from which are hoisted seven jibs a b c d e f g each a seventh part of the whole dimensions and as much more as will fill the whole space when set in an angle of fortyfive degrees so that they may lap when going before the wind and hold more wind when going large thus rigged when going right before the wind the boom should be brought at right angles with the keel by means of the sheet ropes c d and all the sails hauled flat to the boom these positions of boom and sails to be varied as the wind quarters but when the wind is on the beam or when you would turn to windward the boom is to be hauled right fore and aft and the sails trimmed according as the wind is more or less against your course it seems to me that the management of a shallop so rigged would be very easy the sails being run up and down separately so that more or less sail may be made at pleasure and i imagine that there being full as much sail exposed to the force of the wind which impels the vessel in its course as if the whole were in one piece and the resistance of the dead air against the foreside of the sail being diminished the    advantage of swiftness would be very considerable besides that the vessel would lie nearer the wind since we are on the subject of improvements in navigation permit me to detain you a little longer with a small relative observation being in one of my voyages with ten merchant ships under convoy of a frigate at anchor in torbay waiting for a wind to go to the westward it came fair but brought in with it a considerable swell a signal was given for weighing and we put to sea all together but three of the ships left their anchors their cables parting just as the anchors came apeak our cable held and we got up our anchor but the shocks the ship felt before the anchor got loose from the ground made me reflect on what might possibly have caused the breaking of the other cables and i imagined it might be the short bending of the cable just without the hawsehole from a horizontal to an almost vertical position and the sudden violent jerk it receives by the rising of the head of the ship on the swell of a wave while in that position for example suppose a vessel hove up so as to have her head nearly over her anchor which still keeps its hold perhaps in a tough bottom if it were calm the cable still out would form nearly a perpendicular line measuring the distance between the hawsehole and the anchor but if there is a swell her head in the trough of the sea will fall below the level and when lifted on the wave will be much above it in the first case the cable will hang loose and bend perhaps as in figure   in the second case figure   the cable will be drawn straight with a jerk must sustain the whole force of    the rising ship and must either loosen the anchor resist the rising force of the ship or break but why does it break at the hawsehole let us suppose it a cable of three inches diameter and represented by figure   if this cable is to be bent round the corner a it is evident that either the part of the triangle contained between the letters a b c must stretch considerably and those most that are nearest the surface or that the parts between d e f must be compressed or both which most probably happens in this case the lower half of the thickness affords no strength against the jerk it not being strained the upper half bears the whole and the yarns near the upper surface being first and most strained break first and the next yarns follow for in this bent situation they cannot bear the strain all together and each contribute its strength to the whole as they do when the cable is strained in a straight line to remedy this methinks it would be well to have a kind of large pulley wheel fixed in the hawsehole suppose of two feet diameter over which the cable might pass and being there bent gradually to the round of the wheel would thereby be more equally strained and better able to bear the jerk which may save the anchor and by that means in the course of the voyage may happen to save the ship one maritime observation more shall finish this letter i have been a reader of newspapers now near seventy years and i think few years pass without an account of some vessel met with at sea with no living soul on board and so many feet of water in her    hold which vessel has nevertheless been saved and brought into port and when not met with at sea such forsaken vessels have often come ashore on some coast the crews who have taken to their boats and thus abandoned such vessels are sometimes met with and taken up at sea by other ships sometimes reach a coast and are sometimes never heard of those that give an account of quitting their vessels generally say that she sprung a leak that they pumped for some time that the water continued to rise upon them and that despairing to save her they had quitted her lest they should go down with her it seems by the event that this fear was not always well founded and i have endeavored to guess at the reason of the peoples too hasty discouragement when a vessel springs a leak near her bottom the water enters with all the force given by the weight of the column of water without which force is in proportion to the difference of level between the water without and that within it enters therefore with more force at first and in greater quantity than it can afterwards when the water within is higher the bottom of the vessel too is narrower so that the same quantity of water coming into that narrow part rises faster than when the space for it to flow in is larger this helps to terrify but as the quantity entering is less and less as the surfaces without and within become more nearly equal in height the pumps that could not keep the water from rising at first might afterwards be able to prevent its rising higher and the people might have remained on board    in safety without hazarding themselves in an open boat on the wide ocean fig   besides the greater equality in the height of the two surfaces there may sometimes be other causes that retard the farther sinking of a leaky vessel the rising water within may arrive at quantities of light wooden work empty chests and particularly empty watercasks which if fixed so as not to float themselves may help to sustain her many bodies which compose a ships cargo may be specifically lighter than water all these when out of water are an additional weight to that of the ship and she is in proportion pressed deeper into the water but as soon as these bodies are immersed they weigh no longer on the ship but on the contrary if fixed they help to support her in proportion as they are specifically lighter than the water and it should be remembered that the largest body of a ship may be so balanced in the water that an ounce less or more of weight may leave her at the surface or sink her to the bottom there are also certain heavy cargoes that when the water gets at them are continually dissolving and thereby lightening the vessel such as salt and sugar and as to watercasks mentioned above since the quantity of them must be great in ships of war where the number of men consume a great deal of water every day if it had been made a constant rule to bung them up as fast as they were emptied and to dispose the empty casks in proper situations i am persuaded that many ships which have been sunk in engagements or have gone down afterwards might with the unhappy people    have been saved as well as many of those which in the last war foundered and were never heard of while on this topic of sinking one cannot help recollecting the wellknown practice of the chinese to divide the hold of a great ship into a number of separate chambers by partitions tight caulked of which you gave a model in your boat upon the seine so that if a leak should spring in one of them the others are not affected by it and though that chamber should fill to a level with the sea it would not be sufficient to sink the vessel we have not imitated this practice some little disadvantage it might occasion in the stowage is perhaps one reason though that i think might be more than compensated by an abatement in the insurance that would be reasonable and by a higher price taken of passengers who would rather prefer going in such a vessel but our seafaring people are brave despise danger and reject such precautions of safety being cowards only in one sense that of fearing to be thought afraid i promised to finish my letter with the last observation but the garrulity of the old man has got hold of me and as i may never have another occasion of writing on this subject i think i may as well now once for all empty my nautical budget and give you all the thoughts that have in my various long voyages occurred to me relating to navigation i am sure that in you they will meet with a candid judge who will excuse my mistakes on account of my good intention there are six accidents that may occasion the loss  00 of ships at sea we have considered one of them that of foundering by a leak the other five are   oversetting by sudden flaws of wind or by carrying sail beyond the bearing   fire by accident or carelessness   a heavy stroke of lightning making a breach in the ship or firing the powder   meeting and shocking with other ships in the night   meeting in the night with islands of ice to that of oversetting privateers in their first cruise have as far as has fallen within my knowledge or information been more subject than any other kind of vessels the double desire of being able to overtake a weaker flying enemy or escape when pursued by a stronger has induced the owners to overmast their cruisers and to spread too much canvas and the great number of men not seamen who being upon deck when a ship heels suddenly are huddled down to leeward and increase by their weight the effect of the wind this therefore should be more attended to and guarded against especially as the advantage of lofty masts is problematical for the upper sails have greater power to lay a vessel more on her side which is not the most advantageous position for going swiftly through the water and hence it is that vessels which have lost their lofty masts and been able to make little more sail afterwards than permitted the ship to sail upon an even keel have made so much way even under jury masts as to surprise the mariners themselves but there is besides something in the modern form of our ships that seems as if calculated expressly to allow their oversetting more easily the sides of a ship  0  instead of spreading out as they formerly did in the upper works are of late years turned in so as to make the body nearly round and more resembling a cask i do not know what the advantages of this construction are except that such ships are not easily boarded to me it seems a contrivance to have less room in a ship at nearly the same expense for it is evident that the same timber and plank consumed in raising the sides from a to b and from d to c would have raised them from a to e and from d to f fig   in this form all the spaces between e a b and c d f would have been gained the deck would have been larger the men would have had more room to act and not have stood so thick in the way of the enemys shot and the vessel the more she was laid down on her side the more bearing she would meet with and more effectual to support her as being farther from the centre whereas in the present form her ballast makes the chief part of her bearing without which she would turn in the sea almost as easily as a barrel more ballast by this means becomes necessary and that sinking a vessel deeper in the water occasions more resistance to her going through it the bermudian sloops still keep with advantage to the old spreading form the islanders in the great pacific ocean though they have no large ships are the most expert boatsailors in the world navigating that sea safely with their proas which they prevent oversetting by various means their sailing proas for this purpose have outriggers generally to windward above the water on which one or more men are placed to move  0  occasionally farther from or nearer to the vessel as the wind freshens or slackens but some have their outriggers to leeward which resting on the water support the boat so as to keep her upright when pressed down by the wind their boats moved by oars or rather by paddles are for long voyages fixed two together by cross bars of wood that keep them at some distance from each other and so render their oversetting next to impossible how far this may be practicable in larger vessels we have not yet sufficient experience i know of but one trial made in europe which was about one hundred years since by sir william petty he built a double vessel to serve as a packetboat between england and ireland her model still exists in the museum of the royal society where i have seen it by the accounts we have of her she answered well the purpose of her construction making several voyages and though wrecked at last by a storm the misfortune did not appear owing to her particular construction since many other vessels of the common form were wrecked at the same time the advantage of such a vessel is that she needs no ballast therefore swims either lighter or will carry more goods and that passengers are not so much incommoded by her rolling to which may be added that if she is to defend herself by her cannon they will probably have more effect being kept more generally in a horizontal position than those in common vessels i think however that it would be an improvement of that model to make the sides which are opposed to each other perfectly parallel  0  though the other sides are formed as in common thus figure  0 the building of a double ship would indeed be more expensive in proportion to her burthen and that perhaps is sufficient to discourage the method the accident of fire is generally well guarded against by the prudent captains strict orders against smoking between decks or carrying a candle there out of a lantern but there is one dangerous practice which frequent terrible accidents have not yet been sufficient to abolish—that of carrying store spirits to sea in casks two large ships the serapis and the duke of athol one an east indiaman the other a frigate have been burnt within these two last years and many lives miserably destroyed by drawing spirits out of a cask near a candle it is high time to make it a general rule that all the ships stores of spirits should be carried in bottles the misfortune by a stroke of lightning i have in my former writings endeavored to show a method of guarding against by a chain and pointed rod extending when run up from above the top of the mast to the sea these instruments are now made and sold at a reasonable price by nairne  co in london and there are several instances of success attending the use of them they are kept in a box and may be run up and fixed in about five minutes on the apparent approach of a thundergust of the meeting and shocking with other ships in the night i have known two instances in voyages between london and america in one both ships arrived though much damaged each reporting  0  their belief that the other must have gone to the bottom in the other only one got to port the other was never afterwards heard of these instances happened many years ago when the commerce between europe and america was not a tenth part of what it is at present ships of course thinner scattered and the chance of meeting proportionably less it has long been the practice to keep a lookout before in the channel but at sea it has been neglected if it is not at present thought worth while to take that precaution it will in time become of more consequence since the number of ships at sea is continually augmenting a drum frequently beat or a bell rung in a dark night might help to prevent such accidents islands of ice are frequently seen off the banks of newfoundland by ships going between north america and europe in the daytime they are easily avoided unless in a very thick fog i remember two instances of ships running against them in the night the first lost her bowsprit but received little other damage the other struck where the warmth of the sea had wasted the ice next to it and a part hung over above this perhaps saved her for she was under great way but the upper part of the cliff taking her foretopmast broke the shock though it carried away the mast she disengaged herself with some difficulty and got safe into port but the accident shows the possibility of other ships being wrecked and sunk by striking those vast masses of ice of which i have seen one that we judged to be seventy feet high above the water consequently  0  eight times as much under water and it is another reason for keeping a good lookout before though far from any coast that may threaten danger it is remarkable that the people we consider as savages have improved the art of sailing and rowing boats in several points beyond what we can pretend to we have no sailing boats equal to the flying proas of the south seas no rowing or paddling boat equal to that of the greenlanders for swiftness and safety the birch canoes of the north american indians have also some advantageous properties they are so light that two men may carry one of them overland which is capable of carrying a dozen upon the water and in heeling they are not so subject to take in water as our boats the sides of which are lowest in the middle where it is most likely to enter this being highest in that part as in figure    the chinese are an enlightened people the most anciently civilized of any existing and their arts are ancient a presumption in their favor their method of rowing their boats differs from ours the oars being worked either twoastern as we scull or on the sides with the same kind of motion being hung parallel to the keel on a rail and always acting in the water not perpendicular to the side as ours are nor lifted out at every stroke which is a loss of time and the boat in the interval loses motion they see our manner and we theirs but neither are disposed to learn of or copy the other to the several means of moving boats mentioned above may be added the singular one lately exhibited  0  at javelle on the seine below paris where a clumsy boat was moved across that river in three minutes by rowing not in the water but in the air that is by whirling round a set of windmill vanes fixed to a horizontal axis parallel to the keel and placed at the head of the boat the axis was bent into an elbow at the end by the help of which it was turned by one man at a time i saw the operation at a distance the four vanes appeared to be about five feet long and perhaps two and a half wide the weather was calm the labor appeared to be great for one man as the two several times relieved each other but the action upon the air by the oblique surfaces of the vanes must have been considerable as the motion of the boat appeared tolerably quick going and returning and she returned to the same place from whence she first set out notwithstanding the current this machine is since applied to the moving of airballoons an instrument similar may be contrived to move a boat by turning under water several mechanical projectors have at different times proposed to give motion to boats and even to ships by means of circular rowing or paddles placed on the circumference of wheels to be turned constantly on each side of the vessel but this method though frequently tried has never been found so effectual as to encourage a continuance of the practice i do not know that the reason has hitherto been given perhaps it may be this that great part of the force employed contributes little to the motion for instance fig    of the four paddles a b c d all under water and turning to move a boat from  0  x to y c has the most power b nearly though not quite as much their motion being nearly horizontal but the force employed in moving a is consumed in pressing almost downright upon the water till it comes to the place of b and the force employed in moving d is consumed in lifting the water till d arrives at the surface by which means much of the labor is lost it is true that by placing the wheels higher out of the water this waste labor will be diminished in a calm but where a sea runs the wheels must unavoidably be often dipped deep in the waves and the turning of them thereby rendered very laborious to little purpose among the various means of giving motion to a boat that of m bernoulli appears one of the most singular which was to have fixed in the boat a tube in the form of an l the upright part to have a funnelkind of opening at top convenient for filling the tube with water which descending and passing through the lower horizontal part and issuing in the middle of the stern but under the surface of the river should push the boat forward there is no doubt that the force of the descending water would have a considerable effect greater in proportion to the height from which it descended but then it is to be considered that every bucketful pumped or dipped up into the boat from its side or through its bottom must have its vis inertiæ overcome so as to receive the motion of the boat before it can come to give motion by its descent and that will be a deduction from the moving power to remedy this i would propose the addition of another such l  0  pipe and that they should stand back to back in the boat thus figure    the forward one being worked as a pump and sucking in the water at the head of the boat would draw it forward while pushed in the same direction by the force of the stern and after all it should be calculated whether the labor of pumping would be less than that of rowing a fireengine might possibly in some cases be applied in this operation with advantage perhaps this labor of raising water might be spared and the whole force of a man applied to the moving of a boat by the use of air instead of water suppose the boat constructed in this form figure    a a tube round or square of two feet diameter in which a piston may move up and down the piston to have valves in it opening inwards to admit air when the piston rises and shutting when it is forced down by means of the lever b turning on the centre c the tube to have a valve d to open when the piston is forced down and let the air pass out at e which striking forcibly against the water abaft must push the boat forward if there is added an airvessel f properly valved and placed the force would continue to act while a fresh stroke is taken with the lever the boatman might stand with his back to the stern and putting his hands behind him work the motion by taking hold of the cross bar at b while another should steer or if he had two such pumps one on each side of the stern with a lever for each hand he might steer himself by working occasionally more or harder with either hand as watermen now do with a pair of sculls there is no  0  position in which the body of a man can exert more strength than in pulling right upwards to obtain more swiftness greasing the bottom of a vessel is sometimes used and with good effect i do not know that any writer has hitherto attempted to explain this at first sight one would imagine that though the friction of a hard body sliding on another hard body and the resistance occasioned by that friction might be diminished by putting grease between them yet that a body sliding on a fluid such as water should have no need of nor receive any advantage from such greasing but the fact is not disputed and the reason perhaps may be this the particles of water have a mutual attraction called the attraction of adhesion water also adheres to wood and to many other substances but not to grease on the contrary they have a mutual repulsion so that it is a question whether when oil is poured on water they ever actually touch each other for a drop of oil upon water instead of sticking to the spot where it falls as it would if it fell on a lookingglass spreads instantly to an immense distance in a film extremely thin which it could not easily do if it touched and rubbed or adhered even in a small degree to the surface of the water now the adhesive force of water to itself and to other substances may be estimated from the weight of it necessary to separate a drop which adheres while growing till it has weight enough to force the separation and break the drop off let us suppose the drop to be the size of a pea then there will be as many of these adhesions as there are drops of that   0 size touching the bottom of a vessel and these must be broken by the moving power every step of her motion that amounts to a drops breadth and there being no such adhesions to break between the water and a greased bottom may occasion the difference so much respecting the motion of vessels but we have sometimes occasion to stop their motion and if a bottom is near enough we can cast anchor where there are no soundings we have as yet no means to prevent driving in a storm but by lyingto which still permits driving at the rate of about two miles an hour so that in a storm continuing fifty hours which is not an uncommon case the ship may drive one hundred miles out of her course and should she in that distance meet with a lee shore she may be lost to prevent this driving to leeward in deep water a swimming anchor is wanting which ought to have these properties   it should have a surface so large as being at the end of a hawser in the water and placed perpendicularly should hold so much of it as to bring the ships head to the wind in which situation the wind has least power to drive her   it should be able by its resistance to prevent the ships receiving way   it should be capable of being situated below the heave of the sea but not below the undertow   it should not take up much room in the ship   it should be easily thrown out and put into its proper situation   it should be easy to take in again and stow away     an ingenious old mariner whom i formerly knew proposed as a swimming anchor for a large ship to have a stem of wood twentyfive feet long and four inches square with four boards of eighteen sixteen fourteen and twelve feet long and one foot wide the boards to have their substance thickened several inches in the middle by additional wood and to have each a fourinch square hole through its middle to permit its being slipped on occasionally upon the stem and at right angles with it where all being placed and fixed at four feet distance from each other it would have the appearance of the old mathematical instrument called a forestaff this thrown into the sea and held by a hawser veered out to some length he conceived would bring a vessel up and prevent her driving and when taken in might be stowed away by separating the boards from the stem figure    probably such a swimming anchor would have some good effect but it is subject to this objection that lying on the surface of the sea it is liable to be hove forward by every wave and thereby give so much leave for the ship to drive two machines for this purpose have occurred to me which though not so simple as the above i imagine would be more effectual and more easily manageable i will endeavor to describe them that they may be submitted to your judgment whether either would be serviceable and if they would to which we should give the preference the first is to be formed and to be used in the water on almost the same principles with those of a paper kite used in the air only as the paper kite     rises in the air this is to descend in the water its dimensions will be different for ships of different size to make one of suppose fifteen feet high take a small spar of that length for the backbone a b figure    a smaller of half that length c d for the cross piece let these be united by a bolt at e yet so as that by turning on the bolt they may be laid parallel to each other then make a sail of strong canvas in the shape of figure    to form this without waste of sailcloth sew together pieces of the proper length and for half the breadth as in figure    then cut the hole in the diagonal lines a b c and turn the piece f so as to place its broad part opposite to that of the piece g and the piece h in like manner opposite to i which when all sewed together will appear as in figure    this sail is to be extended on the cross of figure    the top and bottom points well secured to the ends of the long spar the two side points d e fastened to the ends of two cords which coming from the angle of the loop which must be similar to the loop of a kite pass through two rings at the ends of the short spar so as that on pulling upon the loop the sail will be drawn to its extent the whole may when aboard be furled up as in figure    having a rope from its broad end to which is tied a bag of ballast for keeping that end downwards when in the water and at the other end another rope with an empty keg at its end to float on the surface this rope long enough to permit the kites descending into the undertow or if you please lower into still water it should be held by a hawser to get it home easily a small loose rope may be     veered out with it fixed to the keg hauling on that rope will bring the kite home with small force the resistance being small as it will then come endways it seems probable that such a kite at the end of a long hawser would keep a ship with her head to the wind and resisting every tug would prevent her driving so fast as when her side is exposed to it and nothing to hold her back if only half the driving is prevented so that she moves but fifty miles instead of the hundred during a storm it may be some advantage both in holding so much distance as is saved and in keeping from a lee shore if single canvas should not be found strong enough to bear the tug without splitting it may be doubled or strengthened by a netting behind it represented by figure  0 the other machine for the same purpose is to be made more in the form of an umbrella as represented in figure    the stem of the umbrella a square spar of proper length with four movable arms of which two are represented c c figure    these arms to be fixed in four joint cleats as dd etc one on each side of the spar but so as that the four arms may open by turning on a pin in the joint when open they form a cross on which a foursquare canvas sail is to be extended its corner fastened to the ends of the four arms those ends are also to be stayed by ropes fastened to the stem or spar so as to keep them short of being at right angles with it and to the end of one of the arms should be hung the small bag of ballast and to the end of     the opposite arm the empty keg this on being thrown into the sea would immediately open and when it had performed its function and the storm over a small rope from its other end being pulled on would turn it close it and draw it easily home to the ship this machine seems more simple in its operation and more easily manageable than the first and perhaps may be as effectual  vessels are sometimes retarded and sometimes forwarded in their voyages by currents at sea which are often not perceived about the year      or    0 there was an application made by the board of customs at boston to the lords of the treasury in london complaining that the packets between falmouth and new york were generally a fortnight longer in their passages than merchantships from london to rhode island and proposing that for the future they should be ordered to rhode island instead of new york being then concerned in the management of the american postoffice i happened to be consulted on the occasion and it appearing strange to me that there should be such a difference between two places scarce a days run asunder especially when the merchantships are generally deeper laden and more weakly manned than the packets and had from london the whole length of the river and channel to run before they left the land of england while the packets had only to go     from falmouth i could not but think the fact misunderstood or misrepresented there happened then to be in london a nantucket seacaptain of my acquaintance to whom i communicated the affair he told me he believed the fact might be true but the difference was owing to this that the rhode island captains were acquainted with the gulf stream which those of the english packets were not we are well acquainted with that stream says he because in our pursuit of whales which keep near the sides of it but are not to be met with in it we run down along the sides and frequently cross it to change our side and in crossing it have sometimes met and spoke with those packets who were in the middle of it and stemming it we have informed them that they were stemming a current that was against them to the value of three miles an hour and advised them to cross it and get out of it but they were too wise to be counselled by simple american fishermen when the winds are but light he added they are carried back by the current more than they are forwarded by the wind and if the wind be good the subtraction of seventy miles a day from their course is of some importance i then observed it was a pity no notice was taken of this current upon the charts and requested him to mark it out for me which he readily complied with adding directions for avoiding it in sailing from europe to north america i procured it to be engraved by order from the general postoffice on the old chart of the atlantic at mount  pages tower hill and copies were sent down to falmouth     for the captains of the packets who slighted it however but it is since printed in france of which edition i hereto annex a copy  this stream is probably generated by the great accumulation of water on the eastern coast of america between the tropics by the tradewinds which constantly blow there it is known that a large piece of water ten miles broad and generally only three feet deep has by a strong wind had its waters driven to one side and sustained so as to become six feet deep while the windward side was laid dry this may give some idea of the quantity heaped upon the american coast and the reason of its running down in a strong current through the islands into the bay of mexico and from thence issuing through the gulf of florida and proceeding along the coast to the banks of newfoundland where it turns off towards and runs down through the western islands having since crossed the stream several times in passing between america and europe i have been attentive to sundry circumstances relating to it by which to know when one is in it and besides the gulfweed with which it is interspersed i find that it is always warmer than the sea on each side of it and that it does not sparkle in the night i annex hereto the observations made with the thermometer in two voyages and possibly may add a third it will appear from them that the thermometer may be a useful instrument to a navigator since currents coming from the northward into southern seas will probably be found colder than the water of those     seas as the currents from southern seas into northern are found warmer and it is not to be wondered that so vast a body of deep warm water several leagues wide coming from between the tropics and issuing out of the gulf into the northern seas should retain its warmth longer than the twenty or thirty days required to its passing the banks of newfoundland the quantity is too great and it is too deep to be suddenly cooled by passing under a cooler air the air immediately over it however may receive so much warmth from it as to be rarefied and rise being rendered lighter than the air on each side of the stream hence those airs must flow in to supply the place of the rising warm air and meeting with each other form those tornados and waterspouts frequently met with and seen near and over the stream and as the vapor from a cup of tea in a warm room and the breath of an animal in the same room are hardly visible but become sensible immediately when out in the cold air so the vapor from the gulf stream in warm latitudes is scarcely visible but when it comes into the cool air from newfoundland it is condensed into the fogs for which those parts are so remarkable the power of wind to raise water above its common level in the sea is known to us in america by the high tides occasioned in all our seaports when a strong northeaster blows against the gulf stream the conclusion from these remarks is that a vessel from europe to north america may shorten her passage by avoiding to stem the stream in which the thermometer will be very useful and a vessel from     america to europe may do the same by the same means of keeping in it it may have often happened accidentally that voyages have been shortened by these circumstances it is well to have the command of them but may there not be another cause independent of winds and currents why passages are generally shorter from america to europe than from europe to america this question i formerly considered in the following short paper benjamin franklin   april      on board the pennsylvania packet captain osborne at sea   april      suppose a ship to make a voyage eastward from a place in latitude  0° north to a place in latitude  0° north distance in longitude    degrees in sailing from  0 to  0 she goes from a place where a degree of longitude is about eight miles greater than in the place she is going to a degree is equal to four minutes of time consequently the ship in the harbor she leaves partaking of the diurnal motion of the earth moves two miles in a minute faster than when in the port she is going to—which is one hundred and twenty miles in an hour this motion in a ship and cargo is of great force and if she could be lifted up suddenly from the harbor in which she lay quiet and set down instantly in the latitude of the port she was bound to though in a calm that force contained in her would make her run a great way at a prodigious rate this force must be lost gradually in her voyage by gradual impulse against the water and probably thence     shorten the voyage query in returning does the contrary happen and is her voyage thereby retarded and lengthened  would it not be a more secure method of planking ships if instead of thick single planks laid horizontally we were to use planks of half the thickness and lay them double and across each other as in figure    to me it seems that the difference of expense would not be considerable and that the ship would be both tighter and stronger the securing of the ship is not the only necessary thing securing the health of the sailors a brave and valuable order of men is likewise of great importance with this view the methods so successfully practised by captain cook in his long voyages cannot be too closely studied or carefully imitated a full account of those methods is found in sir john pringles speech when the medal of the royal society was given to that illustrious navigator i am glad to see in his last voyage that he found the means effectual which i had proposed for preserving flour bread etc from moisture and damage they were found dry and good after being at sea four years the method is described in my printed works page     fifth edition  in the same pages       0  is proposed a means of allaying thirst in case of want of fresh water this has since been practised in two   0 instances with success happy if their hunger when the other provisions are consumed could be relieved as commodiously and perhaps in time this may be found not impossible an addition might be made to their present vegetable provision by drying various roots in slices by the means of an oven the sweet potato of america and spain is excellent for this purpose other potatoes with carrots parsnips and turnips might be prepared and preserved in the same manner with regard to makeshifts in cases of necessity seamen are generally very ingenious themselves they will excuse however the mention of two or three if they happen in any circumstance such as after shipwreck taking to their boat or the like to want a compass a fine sewing needle laid on clear water in a cup will generally point to the north most of them being a little magnetical or may be made so by being strongly rubbed or hammered lying in a north and south direction if their needle is too heavy to float by itself it may be supported by little pieces of cork or wood a man who can swim may be aided in a long traverse by his handkerchief formed into a kite by two cross sticks extending to the four corners which being raised in the air when the wind is fair and fresh will tow him along while lying on his back when force is wanted to move a heavy body and there are but few hands and no machines a long and strong rope may make a powerful instrument suppose a boat is to be drawn up on a beach that she may be out of the surf a stake drove into the beach where you     would have the boat drawn and another to fasten the end of the rope to which comes from the boat and then applying what force you have to pull upon the middle of the rope at right angles with it the power will be augmented in proportion to the length of rope between the posts the rope being fastened to the stake a and drawn upon in the direction c d will slide over the stake b and when the rope is bent to the angle a d b represented by the pricked line in figure    the boat will be at b some sailors may think the writer has given himself unnecessary trouble in pretending to advise them for they have a little repugnance to the advice of landmen whom they esteem ignorant and incapable of giving any worth notice though it is certain that most of their instruments were the invention of landsmen at least the first vessel ever made to go on the water was certainly such i will therefore add only a few words more and they shall be addressed to passengers when you intend a long voyage you may do well to keep your intention as much as possible a secret or at least the time of your departure otherwise you will be continually interrupted in your preparations by the visits of friends and acquaintances who will not only rob you of the time you want but put things out of your mind so that when you come to sea you have the mortification to recollect points of business that ought to have been done accounts you intended to settle and conveniences you had proposed to bring with you etc etc all which have been omitted through the effect of these     officious friendly visits would it not be well if this custom could be changed if the voyager after having without interruption made all his preparations should use some of the time he has left in going himself to take leave of his friends at their own houses and let them come to congratulate him on his happy return it is not always in your power to make a choice in your captain though much of your comfort in the passage may depend on his personal character as you must for so long a time be confined to his company and under his direction if he be a sensible sociable goodnatured obliging man you will be so much the happier such there are but if he happens to be otherwise and is only skilful careful watchful and active in the conduct of his ship excuse the rest for these are the essentials whatever right you may have by agreement in the mass of stores laid in by him for the passengers it is good to have some particular things in your own possession so as to be always at your own command   good water that of the ship being often bad you can be sure of having it good only by bottling it from a clear spring or well and in clean bottles   good tea   coffee ground   chocolate   wine of the sort you particularly like and cider   raisins   almonds   sugar   capillaire  0 lemons    jamaica spirits    eggs greased    diet bread    portable soup    rusks as to fowls it is not worth while to have any called yours unless you could have the feeding and managing     of them according to your own judgment under your own eye as they are generally treated at present in ships they are for the most part sick and their flesh tough and hard as whitleather all seamen have an opinion broached i suppose at first prudently for saving of water when short that fowls do not know when they have drunk enough and will kill themselves if you give them too much so they are served with a little only once in two days this is poured into troughs that lie sloping and therefore immediately runs down to the lower end there the fowls ride upon one anothers backs to get at it and some are not happy enough to reach and once dip their bills in it thus tantalized and tormented with thirst they cannot digest their dry food they fret pine sicken and die some are found dead and thrown overboard every morning and those killed for the table are not eatable their troughs should be in little divisions like cups to hold the water separately figure    but this is never done the sheep and hogs are therefore your best dependence for fresh meat at sea the mutton being generally tolerable and the pork excellent it is possible your captain may have provided so well in the general stores as to render some of the particulars above recommended of little or no use to you but there are frequently in the ship poorer passengers who are taken at a lower price lodge in the steerage and have no claim to any of the cabin provisions or to any but those kinds that are allowed the sailors these people are sometimes dejected     sometimes sick there may be women and children among them in a situation where there is no going to market to purchase such necessaries a few of these your superfluities distributed occasionally may be of great service restore health save life make the miserable happy and thereby afford you infinite pleasure the worst thing in ordinary merchant ships is the cookery they have no professed cook and the worst hand as a seaman is appointed to that office in which he is not only very ignorant but very dirty the sailors have therefore a saying that god sends meat and the devil cooks passengers more piously disposed and willing to believe heaven orders all things for the best may suppose that knowing the sea air and constant exercise by the motion of the vessel would give us extraordinary appetites bad cooks were kindly sent to prevent our eating too much or that foreseeing we should have bad cooks good appetites were furnished to prevent our starving if you cannot trust to these circumstances a spiritlamp with a blazepan may enable you to cook some little things for yourself such as a hash a soup etc and it might be well also to have among your stores some potted meats which if well put up will keep long good a small tin oven to place with the open side before the fire may be another good utensil in which your own servant may roast for you a bit of pork or mutton you will sometimes be induced to eat of the ships salt beef as it is often good you will find cider the best quencher of that thirst which salt meat or fish occasions the     ship biscuit is too hard for some sets of teeth it may be softened by toasting but rusk is better for being made of good fermented bread sliced and baked a second time the pieces imbibe the water easily soften immediately digest more kindly and are therefore more wholesome than the unfermented biscuit by the way rusk is the true original biscuit so prepared to keep for sea biscuit in french signifying twice baked if your dry peas boil hard a twopound iron shot put with them into the pot will by the motion of the ship grind them as fine as mustard the accidents i have seen at sea with large dishes of soup upon a table from the motion of the ship have made me wish that our potters or pewterers would make soup dishes in divisions like a set of small bowls united together each containing about sufficient for one person in some such form as figure    for then when the ship should make a sudden heel the soup would not in a body flow over one side and fall into peoples laps and scald them as is sometimes the case but would be retained in the separate divisions as in figure    after these trifles permit the addition of a few general reflections navigation when employed in supplying necessary provisions to a country in want and thereby preventing famines which were so frequent and destructive before the invention of the art is undoubtedly a blessing to mankind when employed merely in transporting superfluities it is a question whether the advantage of the employment it affords is equal to the mischief of hazarding so     many lives on the ocean but when employed in pillaging merchants and transporting slaves it is clearly the means of augmenting the mass of human misery it is amazing to think of the ships and lives risked in fetching tea from china coffee from arabia sugar and tobacco from america all which our ancestors did well without sugar employs near one thousand ships tobacco almost as many for the utility of tobacco there is little to be said and for that of sugar how much more commendable would it be if we could give up the few minutes gratification afforded once or twice a day by the taste of sugar in our tea rather than encourage the cruelties exercised in producing it an eminent french moralist says that when he considers the wars we excite in africa to obtain slaves the numbers necessarily slain in those wars the prisoners who perish at sea by sickness bad provisions foul air etc in the transportation and how many afterwards die from the hardships of slavery he cannot look on a piece of sugar without conceiving it stained with spots of human blood had he added the consideration of the wars we make to take and retake the sugar islands from one another and the fleets and armies that perish in those expeditions he might have seen his sugar not merely spotted but thoroughly dyed scarlet in grain it is these wars that make the maritime powers of europe the inhabitants of london and paris pay dearer for sugar than those of vienna a thousand miles from the sea because their sugar costs not only the price they pay for it by the pound but all they pay in taxes to     maintain the fleets and armies that fight for it  with great esteem i am sir your humble servant b franklin appendix to the above letter remarks upon the navigation from newfoundland to new york  after you have passed the banks of newfoundland in about the fortyfourth degree of latitude you will meet with nothing till you draw near the isle of sables which we commonly pass in latitude   ° southward of this isle the current is found to extend itself as far north as   °  0′ or  0′ then it turns towards the e s e or s e     e having passed the isle of sables shape your course for st georges banks so as to pass them in about latitude  0° because the current southward of those banks reaches as far north as   ° the shoals of those banks lie in  0°   ′ after having passed st georges banks you must to clear nantucket form your course so as to pass between the latitudes   °  0′ and  0°   ′ the most southern part of the shoals of nantucket lie in about  0°   ′ the northern part of the current directly to the south of nantucket is felt in about latitude   °  0′     by observing these directions and keeping between the stream and the shoals the passage from the banks of newfoundland to new york delaware or virginia may be considerably shortened for so you will have the advantage of the eddy current which moves contrary to the gulf stream whereas if to avoid the shoals you keep too far to the southward and get into that stream you will be retarded by it at the rate of sixty or seventy miles a day the nantucket whalemen being extremely well acquainted with the gulf stream its course strength and extent by their constant practice of whaling on the edges of it from their island quite down to the bahamas this draft of that stream plate vol x p     was obtained from one of them captain folger and caused to be engraved on the old chart in london for the benefit of navigators by b franklin note—the nantucket captains who are acquainted with this stream make their voyages from england to boston in as short a time generally as others take in going from boston to england viz from twenty to thirty days a stranger may know when he is in the gulf stream by the warmth of the water which is much greater than that of the water on each side of it if then he is bound to the westward he should cross the stream to get out of it as soon as possible b franklin

were surprised to observe the water six degrees colder by the thermometer than the preceding noon this day  0th the thermometer still kept descending and at five in the morning of the   th it was in water as low as  0 when we struck soundings the same evening the pilot came on board and we found our ship about five degrees of longitude ahead of the reckoning which our captain accounted for by supposing our course to have been near the edge of the gulf stream and thus an eddycurrent always in our favor by the distance we ran from september  th in the evening till we struck soundings we must have then been at the western edge of the gulf stream and the change in the temperature of the water was probably owing to our suddenly passing from that current into the waters of our own climate on the   th of august the following experiment was made the weather being perfectly calm an empty bottle corked very tight was sent down twenty fathoms and it was drawn up still empty it was then sent down again thirtyfive fathoms when the weight of the water having forced in the cork it was drawn up full the water it contained was immediately tried by the thermometer and     found to be  0 which was six degrees colder than at the surface the lead and bottle were visible but not very distinctly so at the depth of twelve fathoms but when only seven fathoms deep they were perfectly seen from the ship this experiment was thus repeated september   th when we were in soundings of eighteen fathoms a keg was previously prepared with a valve at each end one opening inward the other outward this was sent to the bottom in expectation that by the valves being both open when going down and both shut when coming up it would keep within it the water received at bottom the upper valve performed its office well but the under one did not shut quite close so that much of the water was lost in hauling it up the ships side as the water in the kegs passage upwards could not enter at the top it was concluded that what water remained in it was of that near the ground and on trying this by the thermometer it was found to be at    which was    degrees colder than at the surface this last journal

mccclxxi from miss catherine louisa shipley twyford   august      my dear good friend— you gave me leave to write to you and i take the first opportunity of     profiting by your indulgence i do assure you we all left your ship with a heavy heart but the taking leave was a scene we wished to save you as well as ourselves god grant you may have a good voyage it is our constant toast every day at dinner i was quite provoked with myself when i got to southampton that i had not thought of something to leave with you that might have been useful during the voyage to remind you of me you produced a housewife possibly you had no pincushion how happy would it have made me to have given you one did you ever taste the ginger cake and think it had belonged to your fellowtraveller in short i want some excuse for asking whether you ever think about me we are forever talking of our good friend something is perpetually occurring to remind us of the time spent with you we never walk in the garden without seeing dr franklins room and thinking of the work that was begun in it  i have sincerely wished you a good voyage but since the completion of that work depends on its length i cannot wish it may be short i had a letter from emily the night after i got home to inquire whether your stay at southampton would allow time for her coming to see you bessy regretted much that she lost that happiness i have written to dear georgiana a long account of you for i know every circumstance will be interesting to her  indeed my dear sir from     my father and mother down to their youngest child we all respect and love you i have not sent the verses because i intend to make them an excuse for troubling you with another letter believe me my dear good friend most affectionately yours catherine louisa shipley david hartley    august      london benjamin franklin mccclxxii from david hartley london    august      my dear friend— i thank you for your last kind remembrance of me from southampton i was very unfortunately absent in the country for the two days in which i could have had the pleasure of seeing you at southampton had i heard of your being there i heard it in london on wednesday afternoon the   th of july i got within a mile of southampton the next morning and met the bishop of st asaph who had just left you on board and under sail i greatly regret my disappointment we were three of us all of one name and of one affection and respect for you though i must still claim the preeminence in this above my relations having had the happiness of knowing you most although we are separated yet i hope you know me too well not to remain always assured that i shall forever continue united with you in our favorite pursuit of promoting goodwill and a good understanding between our two countries as the probable means of securing durable     peace the best of human blessings i hope you will remember me when you arrive in your own country and that you will always consider me as an unalterable friend to peace and justice and forever your friend and wellwisher my brother and sister desire to be most kindly remembered to you as likewise my cousin mr samuel hartley whom you know and his brother colonel james hartley desires to join from his respect to your character though he never had the pleasure of seeing you i hope you will favor me with your correspondence particularly upon any interesting public events i ask this of you as a joint friend of amity and peace between our two countries god bless you in health and happiness your ever most affectionate friend d hartley benjamin franklin    august      john ingenhousz mccclxxiii to john ingenhousz at vienna  at sea    august      dear friend— in one of your letters a little before i left france you desire me to give you in writing my thoughts upon the construction and use of chimneys a subject you had sometimes heard me touch upon in conversation i embrace willingly this leisure afforded by my present situation to   0 comply with your request as it will not only show my regard to the desires of a friend but may at the same time be of some utility to others the doctrine of chimneys appearing not to be as yet generally well understood and mistakes respecting them being attended with constant inconvenience if not remedied and with fruitless expense if the true remedies are mistaken those who would be acquainted with this subject should begin by considering on what principle smoke ascends in any chimney at first many are apt to think that smoke is in its nature and of itself specifically lighter than air and rises in it for the same reason that cork rises in water these see no cause why smoke should not rise in the chimney though the room be ever so close others think there is a power in chimneys to draw up the smoke and that there are different forms of chimneys which afford more or less of this power these amuse themselves with searching for the best form the equal dimensions of a funnel in its whole length are not thought artificial enough and it is made for fancied reasons sometimes tapering and narrowing from below upwards and sometimes the contrary etc etc a simple experiment or two may serve to give more correct ideas having lit a pipe of tobacco plunge the stem to the bottom of a decanter half filled with cold water then putting a rag over the bowl blow through it and make the smoke descend in the stem of the pipe from the end of which it will rise in bubbles through the water and being thus cooled will not afterwards rise to go out through the neck of     the decanter but remain spreading itself and resting on the surface of the water this shows that smoke is really heavier than air and that it is carried upwards only when attached to or acted upon by air that is heated and thereby rarefied and rendered specifically lighter than the air in its neighborhood smoke being rarely seen but in company with heated air and its upward motion being visible though that of the rarefied air that drives it is not so has naturally given rise to the error i need not explain to you my learned friend what is meant by rarefied air but if you make the public use you propose of this letter it may fall into the hands of some who are unacquainted with the term and with the thing these then may be told that air is a fluid which has weight as well as others though about eight hundred times lighter than water that heat makes the particles of air recede from each other and take up more space so that the same weight of air heated will have more bulk than equal weights of cold air which may surround it and in that case must rise being forced upwards by such colder and heavier air which presses to get under it and take its place that air is so rarefied or expanded by heat may be proved to their comprehension by a lank blown bladder which laid before a fire will soon swell grow tight and burst another experiment may be to take a glass tube about an inch in diameter and twelve inches long open at both ends and fixed upright on legs so that it need not be handled for the hands might warm it at the end of a quill fasten five or six inches of the     finest light filament of silk so that it may be held either above the upper end of the tube or under the lower end your warm hand being at a distance by the length of the quill plate ii fig   if there were any motion of air through the tube it would manifest itself by its effect on the silk but if the tube and the air in it are of the same temperature with the surrounding air there will be no such motion whatever may be the form of the tube whether crooked or straight narrow below and widening upwards or the contrary the air in it will be quiescent warm the tube and you will find as long as it continues warm a constant current of air entering below and passing up through it till discharged at the top because the warmth of the tube being communicated to the air it contains rarefies that air and makes it lighter than the air without which therefore presses in below forces it upwards and follows and takes its place and is rarefied in its turn and without warming the tube if you hold under it a knob of hot iron the air thereby heated will rise and fill the tube going out at its top and this motion in the tube will continue as long as the knob remains hot because the air entering the tube below is heated and rarefied by passing near and over that knob that this motion is produced merely by the difference of specific gravity between the fluid within and that without the tube and not by any fancied form of the tube itself may appear by plunging it into water contained in a glass jar a foot deep through which such motion might be seen the water within and without the tube being of the same specific f     gravity balance each other and both remain at rest but take out the tube stop its bottom with a finger and fill it with olive oil which is lighter than water then stopping the top place it as before its lower end under water its top a very little above as long as you keep the bottom stopped the fluids remain at rest but the moment it is unstopped the heavier enters below forces up the lighter and takes its place and the motion then ceases merely because the new fluid cannot be successfully made lighter as air may be by a warm tube  in fact no form of the funnel of a chimney has any share in its operation or effect respecting smoke except its height the longer the funnel if erect the greater its force when filled with heated and rarefied air to draw in below and drive up the smoke if one may in compliance with custom use the expression draw when in fact it is the superior weight of the surrounding atmosphere that presses to enter the funnel below and so drives up before it the smoke and warm air it meets with in its passage i have been the more particular in explaining these first principles because for want of clear ideas respecting them much fruitless expense has been occasioned not only single chimneys but in some instances within my knowledge whole stacks having been pulled down and rebuilt with funnels of different forms imagined more powerful in drawing smoke but having still the same height and the same opening below have performed no better than their predecessors what is it then which makes a smoky chimney     that is a chimney which instead of conveying up all the smoke discharges a part of it into the room offending the eyes and damaging the furniture the causes of this effect which have fallen under my observation amount to nine differing from each other and therefore requiring different remedies   smoky chimneys in a new house are such frequently from mere want of air the workmanship of the rooms being all good and just out of the workmans hand the joints of the boards of the flooring and of the panels of wainscoting are all true and tight the more so as the walls perhaps not yet thoroughly dry preserve a dampness in the air of the room which keeps the woodwork swelled and close the doors and the sashes too being worked with truth shut with exactness so that the room is as tight as a snuffbox no passage being left open for air to enter except the keyhole and even that is sometimes covered by a little dropping shutter now if smoke cannot rise but as connected with rarefied air and a column of such air suppose it filling the funnel cannot rise unless other air be admitted to supply its place and if therefore no current of air enter the opening of the chimney there is nothing to prevent the smoke coming out into the room if the motion upwards of the air in a chimney that is freely supplied be observed by the rising of the smoke or a feather in it and it be considered that in the time such feather takes in rising from the fire to the top of the chimney a column of air equal to the contents of the funnel must be discharged and an equal quantity supplied     from the room below it will appear absolutely impossible that this operation should go on if the tight room is kept shut for were there any force capable of drawing constantly so much air out of it it must soon be exhausted like the receiver of an airpump and no animal could live in it those therefore who stop every crevice in a room to prevent the admission of fresh air and yet would have their chimney carry up the smoke require inconsistencies and expect impossibilities yet under this situation i have seen the owner of a new house in despair and ready to sell it for much less than it cost conceiving it uninhabitable because not a chimney in any one of its rooms would carry off the smoke unless a door or window were left open much expense has also been made to alter and amend new chimneys which had really no fault in one house particularly that i knew of a nobleman in westminster that expense amounted to no less than three hundred pounds after his house had been as he thought finished and all charges paid and after all several of the alterations were ineffectual for want of understanding the true principles remedies when you find on trial that opening the door or a window enables the chimney to carry up all the smoke you may be sure that want of air from without was the cause of its smoking i say from without to guard you against a common mistake of those who may tell you the room is large contains abundance of air sufficient to supply any chimney and therefore it cannot be that the chimney wants air these reasoners are ignorant that the largeness     of a room if tight is in this case of small importance since it cannot part with a chimney full of its air without occasioning so much vacuum which it requires a great force to effect and could not be borne if effected it appearing plainly then that some of the outward air must be admitted the question will be how much is absolutely necessary for you would avoid admitting more as being contrary to one of your intentions in having a fire viz that of warming your room to discover this quantity shut the door gradually while a middling fire is burning till you find that before it is quite shut the smoke begins to come out into the room then open it a little till you perceive the smoke comes out no longer there hold the door and observe the width of the open crevice between the edge of the door and the rabbet it should shut into suppose the distance to be half an inch and the door eight feet high you find thence that your room requires an entrance for air equal in area to ninetysix half inches or fortyeight square inches or a passage of six inches by eight this however is a large supposition there being few chimneys that having a moderate opening and a tolerable height of funnel will not be satisfied with such a crevice of a quarter of an inch and i have found a square of six by six or thirtysix square inches to be a pretty good medium that will serve for most chimneys high funnels with small and low openings may indeed be supplied through a less space because for reasons that will appear hereafter the force of levity if one may so speak being greater in such funnels the cool     air enters the room with greater velocity and consequently more enters in the same time this however has its limits for experience shows that no increased velocity so occasioned has made the admission of air through the keyhole equal in quantity to that through an open door though through the door the current moves slowly and through the keyhole with great rapidity it remains then to be considered how and where this necessary quantity of air from without is to be admitted so as to be least inconvenient for if at the door left so much open the air thence proceeds directly to the chimney and in its way comes cold to your back and heels as you sit before your fire if you keep the door shut and raise a little the sash of your window you feel the same inconvenience various have been the contrivances to avoid this such as bringing in fresh air through pipes in the jambs of the chimney which pointing upwards should blow the smoke up the funnel opening passages into the funnel above to let in air for the same purpose but these produce an effect contrary to that intended for as it is the constant current of air passing from the room through the opening of the chimney into the funnel which prevents the smoke coming out into the room if you supply the funnel by other means or in other ways with the air it wants and especially if that air be cold you diminish the force of that current and the smoke in its effort to enter the room finds less resistance the wanted air must then indispensably be admitted into the room to supply what goes off through     the opening of the chimney m gauger a very ingenious and intelligent french writer on the subject proposes with judgment to admit it above the opening of the chimney and to prevent inconvenience from its coldness he directs its being made to pass in its entrance through winding cavities made behind the iron back and sides of the fireplace and under the iron hearthplate in which cavities it will be warmed and even heated so as to contribute much instead of cooling to the warming of the room this invention is excellent in itself and may be used with advantage in building new houses because the chimneys may then be so disposed as to admit conveniently the cold air to enter such passages but in houses built without such views the chimneys are often so situated as not to afford that convenience without great and expensive alterations easy and cheap methods though not quite so perfect in themselves are of more general utility and such are the following in all rooms where there is a fire the body of air warmed and rarefied before the chimney is continually changing place and making room for other air that is to be warmed in its turn part of it enters and goes up the chimney and the rest rises and takes place near the ceiling if the room be lofty the warm air remains above our heads as long as it continues warm and we are little benefited by it because it does not descend till it is cooler few can imagine the difference of climate between the upper and lower parts of such a room who have not tried it by the thermometer or by going up a ladder till     their heads are near the ceiling it is then among this warm air that the wanted quantity of outward air is best admitted with which being mixed its coldness is abated and its inconvenience diminished so as to become scarce observable this may be easily done by drawing down about an inch the upper sash of a window or if not movable by cutting such a crevice through its frame in both which cases it will be well to place a thin shelf of the length to conceal the opening and sloping upwards to direct the entering air horizontally along and under the ceiling in some houses the air may be admitted by such a crevice made in the wainscot cornice or plastering near the ceiling and over the opening of the chimney this if practicable is to be chosen because the entering cold air will there meet with the warmest rising air from before the fire and be soonest tempered by the mixture the same kind of shelf should also be placed here another way and not a very difficult one is to take out an upper pane of glass in one of your sashes set in a tin frame plate fig   giving it two springing angular sides and then replacing it with hinges below on which it may be turned to open more or less above it will then have the appearance of an internal skylight by drawing this pane in more or less you may admit what air you find necessary its position will naturally throw that air up and along the ceiling this is what is called in france a wasistdas as this is a german question the invention is probably of that nation and takes its name from the frequent asking of that question when it first appeared in   0 england some have of late years cut a round hole about five inches diameter in a pane of the sash and placed against it a circular plate of tin hung on an axis and cut into vanes which being separately bent a little obliquely are acted upon by the entering air so as to force the plate continually round like the vanes of a windmill this admits the outward air and by the continual whirling of the vanes does in some degree disperse it the noise only is a little inconvenient   a second cause of the smoking of chimneys is their openings in the room being too large that is too wide too high or both architects in general have no other ideas of proportion in the opening of a chimney than what relates to symmetry and beauty respecting the dimensions of the room  while its true proportion respecting its function and utility depends on quite other principles and they might as properly proportion the step in a staircase to the height of a story instead of the natural elevation of mens legs in mounting the proportion then to be regarded is what relates to the height of the funnel for as the funnels in the different stories of a house are necessarily of different heights or lengths that from the lowest floor being the highest or longest and those of the other floors shorter and shorter till we come to those in the garrets which are of course the shortest and the force of draft being as already said in proportion to the height of funnel filled with rarefied air and a current of air from the room into the chimney sufficient to fill the opening being     necessary to oppose and prevent the smoke coming out into the room it follows that the openings of the longest funnels may be larger and that those of the shorter funnels should be smaller for if there be a larger opening to a chimney that does not draw strongly the funnel may happen to be furnished with the air it demands by a partial current entering on one side of the opening and leaving the other side free of any opposing current may permit the smoke to issue there into the room much too of the force of draft in a funnel depends on the degree of rarefaction in the air it contains and that depends on the nearness to the fire of its passage in entering the funnel if it can enter far from the fire on each side or far above the fire in a wide or high opening it receives little heat in passing by the fire and the contents of the funnel are by that means less different in levity from the surrounding atmosphere and its force in drawing consequently weaker hence if too large an opening be given to chimneys in upper rooms those rooms will be smoky on the other hand if too small openings be given to chimneys in the lower rooms the entering air operating too directly and violently on the fire and afterwards strengthening the draft as it ascends the funnel will consume the fuel too rapidly remedy as different circumstances frequently mix themselves in these matters it is difficult to give precise dimensions for the openings of all chimneys our fathers made them generally much too large we have lessened them but they are often still of greater dimension than they should be the human     eye not being easily reconciled to sudden and great changes if you suspect that your chimney smokes from the too great dimension of its opening contract it by placing movable boards so as to lower and narrow it gradually till you find the smoke no longer issues into the room the proportion so found will be that which is proper for that chimney and you may employ the bricklayer or mason to reduce it accordingly however as in building new houses something must be sometimes hazarded i would make the openings in my lower rooms about thirty inches square and eighteen deep and those in the upper only eighteen inches square and not quite so deep the intermediate ones diminishing in proportion as the height of funnel diminished in the larger openings billets of two feet long or half the common length of cordwood may be burnt conveniently and for the smaller such wood may be sawed into thirds where coals are the fuel the grates will be proportioned to the openings the same depth is nearly necessary to all the funnels being all made of a size proper to admit a chimney sweeper if in large and elegant rooms custom or fancy should require the appearance of a larger chimney it may be formed of expensive marginal decorations in marble etc in time perhaps that which is fittest in the nature of things may come to be thought handsomest but at present when men and women in different countries show themselves dissatisfied with the forms god has given to their heads waists and feet and pretend to shape them more perfectly it is hardly to be expected that they     will be content always with the best form of a chimney and there are some i know so bigoted to the fancy of a large noble opening that rather than change it they would submit to have damaged furniture sore eyes and skins almost smoked to bacon   another cause of smoky chimneys is too short a funnel this happens necessarily in some cases as where a chimney is required in a low building for if the funnel be raised high above the roof in order to strengthen its draft it is then in danger of being blown down and crushing the roof in its fall remedies contract the opening of the chimney so as to oblige all the entering air to pass through or very near the fire whereby it will be more heated and rarefied the funnel itself be more warmed and its contents have more of what may be called the force of levity so as to rise strongly and maintain a good draft at the opening or you may in some cases to advantage build additional stories over the low building which will support a high funnel if the low building be used as a kitchen and a contraction of the opening therefore inconvenient a large one being necessary at least when there are great dinners for the free management of so many cooking utensils in such case i would advise the building of two more funnels joining to the first and having three moderate openings one to each funnel instead of one large one when there is occasion to use but one the other two may be kept shut by sliding plates hereafter to be described  and two     or all of them may be used together when wanted this will indeed be an expense but not a useless one since your cooks will work with more comfort see better than in a smoky kitchen what they are about your victuals will be cleaner dressed and not taste of smoke as is often the case and to render the effect more certain a stack of three funnels may be safely built higher above the roof than a single funnel the case of too short a funnel is more general than would be imagined and often found where one would not expect it for it is not uncommon in ill contrived buildings instead of having a funnel for each room or fireplace to bend and turn the funnel of an upper room so as to make it enter the side of another funnel that comes from below by this means the upperroom funnel is made short of course since its length can only be reckoned from the place where it enters the lowerroom funnel and that funnel is also shortened by all the distance between the entrance of the second funnel and the top of the stack for all that part being readily supplied with air through the second funnel adds no strength to the draft especially as the air is cold when there is no fire in the second chimney the only easy remedy here is to keep the opening shut of that funnel in which there is no fire   another very common cause of the smoking of chimneys is their overpowering one another for instance if there be two chimneys in one large room and you make fires in both of them the doors and windows close shut you will find that the greater and stronger fire shall overpower the weaker and draw     air down its funnel to supply its own demand which air descending in the weaker funnel will drive down its smoke and force it into the room if instead of being in one room the two chimneys are in two different rooms communicating by a door the case is the same whenever that door is open in a very tight house i have known a kitchen chimney on the lowest floor when it had a great fire in it overpower any other chimney in the house and draw air and smoke into the room as often as the door was opened communicating with the staircase remedy take care that every room has the means of supplying itself from without with the air its chimney may require so that no one of them may be obliged to borrow from another nor under the necessity of lending a variety of these means have been already described   another cause of smoking is when the tops of chimneys are commanded by higher buildings or by a hill so that the wind blowing over such eminences falls like water over a dam sometimes almost perpendicularly on the tops of the chimneys that lie in its way and beats down the smoke contained in them remedy that commonly applied to this case is a turncap made of tin or plate iron covering the chimney above and on three sides open on one side turning on a spindle and which being guided or governed by a vane always presents its back to the current this i believe may be generally effectual though not certain as there may be cases in which it will not succeed raising your funnels if practicable so as their tops may be higher or at least equal     with the commanding eminence is more to be depended on but the turning cap being easier and cheaper should first be tried if obliged to build in such a situation i would choose to place my doors on the side next the hill and the backs of my chimneys on the farthest side for then the column of air falling over the eminence and of course pressing on that below and forcing it to enter the doors or wasistdases on the side would tend to balance the pressure down the chimneys and leave the funnels more free in the exercise of their functions   there is another case of command the reverse of that last mentioned it is where the commanding eminence is farther from the wind than the chimney commanded to explain this a figure may be necessary suppose then a building whose side a happens to be exposed to the wind and forms a kind of dam against its progress plate fig   the air obstructed by the dam will like water press and search for passages through it and finding the top of the chimney b below the top of the dam it will force itself down the funnel in order to get through by some door or window open on the other side of the building and if there be a fire in such chimney its smoke is of course beat down and fills the room remedy i know of but one which is to raise such funnel higher than the roof supporting it if necessary by iron bars for a turncap in this case has no effect the dammed up air pressing down through it in whatever position the wind may have placed its opening i know a city in which many houses are rendered     smoky by this operation for their kitchens being built behind and connected by a passage with the houses and the tops of the kitchen chimneys lower than the top of the houses the whole side of a street when the wind blows against its back forms such a dam as above described and the wind so obstructed forces down those kitchen chimneys especially when they have but weak fires in them to pass through the passage and house into the street kitchen chimneys so formed and situated have another inconvenience in summer if you open your upper room windows for air a light breeze blowing over your kitchen chimney towards the house though not strong enough to force down its smoke as aforesaid is sufficient to waft it into your windows and fill the rooms with it which besides the disagreeableness damages your furniture   chimneys otherwise drawing well are sometimes made to smoke by the improper and inconvenient situation of a door when the door and chimney are on the same side of the room as in the figure if the door a being in the corner is made to open against the wall plate fig   which is common as being there when open more out of the way it follows that when the door is only opened in part a current of air rushing in passes along the wall into and across the opening of the chimney b and flirts some of the smoke out into the room this happens more certainly when the door is shutting for then the force of the current is augmented and becomes very inconvenient to those who warming themselves by the fire happen to sit in its way     the remedies are obvious and easy either put an intervening screen from the wall round great part of the fireplace or which is perhaps preferable shift the hinges of your door so as it may open the other way and when open throw the air along the other wall   a room that has no fire in its chimney is sometimes filled with smoke which is received at the top of its funnel and descends into the room in a former paper  i have already explained the descending currents of air in cold funnels it may not be amiss however to repeat here that funnels without fires have an effect according to their degree of coldness or warmth on the air that happens to be contained in them the surrounding atmosphere is frequently changing its temperature but stacks of funnels covered from winds and sun by the house that contains them retain a more equal temperature if after a warm season the outward air suddenly grows cold the empty warm funnels begin to draw strongly upward that is they rarefy the air contained in them which of course rises cooler air enters below to supply its place is rarefied in its turn and rises and this operation continues till the funnel grows cooler or the outward air warmer or both when the motion ceases on the other hand if after a cold season the outward air suddenly grows warm and of course lighter the air contained in the cool funnels being heavier descends into the room and the warmer air which enters their tops being cooled in its turn and made heavier continues to descend and this operation     goes on till the funnels are warmed by the passing of warm air through them or the air itself grows cooler when the temperature of the air and of the funnels is nearly equal the difference of warmth in the air between day and night is sufficient to produce these currents the air will begin to ascend the funnels as the cool of the evening comes on and this current will continue till perhaps nine or ten oclock the next morning when it begins to hesitate and as the heat of the day approaches it sets downwards and continues so till towards evening when it again hesitates for some time and then goes upwards constantly during the night as before mentioned now when smoke issuing from the tops of neighboring funnels passes over the tops of funnels which are at the time drawing downwards as they often are in the middle part of the day such smoke is of necessity drawn into these funnels and descends with the air into the chamber the remedy is to have a sliding plate hereafter described  that will shut perfectly the offending funnel   chimneys which generally draw well do nevertheless sometimes give smoke into the rooms it being driven down by strong winds passing over the tops of their funnels though not descending from any commanding eminence this case is most frequent where the funnel is short and the opening turned from the wind it is the more grievous when it happens to be a cold wind that produces the effect because when you most want your fire you are sometimes obliged to extinguish it to understand   0 this it may be considered that the rising light air to obtain a free issue from the funnel must push out of its way or oblige the air that is over it to rise in a time of calm or of little wind this is done visibly for we see the smoke that is brought up by that air rise in a column above the chimney but when a violent current of air that is a strong wind passes over the top of a chimney its particles have received so much force which keeps them in a horizontal direction and follow each other so rapidly that the rising light air has not strength sufficient to oblige them to quit that direction and move upwards to permit its issue add to this that some of the current passing over that side of the funnel which it first meets with viz at a plate fig   having been compressed by the resistance of the funnel may expand itself over the flue and strike the interior opposite side at b from whence it may be reflected downwards and from side to side in the direction of the pricked lines c c c remedies in some places particularly in venice where they have not stacks of chimneys but single flues the custom is to open or widen the top of the flue rounding in the true form of a funnel plate fig   which some think may prevent the effect just mentioned for that the wind blowing over one of the edges into the funnel may be slanted out again on the other side by its form i have had no experience of this but i have lived in a windy country where the contrary is practised the tops of the flues being narrowed inwards so as to form a slit for the issue of the smoke long as the breadth of the funnel and     only four inches wide this seems to have been contrived on a supposition that the entry of the wind would thereby be obstructed and perhaps it might have been imagined that the whole force of the rising warm air being condensed as it were in the narrow opening would thereby be strengthened so as to overcome the resistance of the wind this however did not always succeed for when the wind was at northeast and blew fresh the smoke was forced down by fits into the room i commonly sat in so as to oblige me to shift the fire into another the position of the slit of this funnel was indeed northeast and southwest perhaps if it had lain across the wind the effect might have been different but on this i can give no certainty it seems a matter proper to be referred to experiment possibly a turncap might have been serviceable but it was not tried chimneys have not been long in use in england i formerly saw a book printed in the time of queen elizabeth which remarked the then modern improvements of living and mentioned among others the convenience of chimneys our forefathers said the author had no chimneys there was in each dwellinghouse only one place for a fire and the smoke went out through a hole in the roof but now there is scarce a gentlemans house in england that has not at least one chimney in it when there was but one chimney its top might then be opened as a funnel and perhaps borrowing the form from the venetians it was then the flue of a chimney got that name such is now the growth of luxury that in     both england and france we must have a chimney for every room and in some houses every possessor of a chamber and almost every servant will have a fire so that the flues being necessarily built in stacks the opening of each as a funnel is impracticable this change of manners soon consumed the firewood of england and will soon render fuel extremely scarce and dear in france if the use of coals be not introduced in the latter kingdom as it has been in the former where it at first met with opposition for there is extant in the records of one of queen elizabeths parliaments a motion made by a member reciting that many dyers brewers smiths and other artificers of london had of late taken to the use of pitcoal for their fires instead of wood which filled the air with noxious vapors and smoke very prejudicial to the health particularly of persons coming out of the country and therefore moving that a law might pass to prohibit the use of such fuel at least during the session of parliament by those artificers it seems it was not then commonly used in private houses its supposed unwholesomeness was an objection luckily the inhabitants of london have got over that objection and now think it rather contributes to render their air salubrious as they have had no general pestilential disorder since the general use of coals when before it such were frequent paris still burns wood at an enormous expense continually augmenting the inhabitants having still that prejudice to overcome in germany you are happy in the use of stoves which save fuel wonderfully your people are very ingenious in the management     of fire but they may still learn something in that art from the chinese  whose country being greatly populous and fully cultivated has little room left for the growth of wood and having not much other fuel that is good they have been forced upon many inventions during a course of ages for making a little fire go as far as possible i have thus gone through all the common causes of the smoking of chimneys that i can at present recollect as having fallen under my observation communicating the remedies that i have known successfully used for the different cases together with the principles on which both the disease and the remedy depend and confessing my ignorance wherever i have been sensible of it you will do well if you publish as you propose this letter to add in notes or as you please such observations as may have occurred to your attentive mind and if other philosophers will do the same this part of science though humble yet of great utility may in time be perfected for many years past i have rarely met with a case of smoky chimney which has not been solvable on these principles and cured by these remedies where people have been willing to apply them which is indeed not always the case for many have prejudices in favor of the nostrum of pretended chimney doctors and fumists and some have conceits and fancies of their own which they rather choose to try than to lengthen a funnel alter the size of an opening or admit air into a room however necessary for some are as much afraid of fresh air as persons in the     hydrophobia are of fresh water i myself had formerly this prejudice this aerophobia as i now account it and dreading the supposed dangerous effects of cool air i considered it as an enemy and closed with extreme care every crevice in the rooms i inhabited experience has convinced me of my error i now look upon fresh air as a friend i even sleep with an open window i am persuaded that no common air from without is so unwholesome as the air within a close room that has been often breathed and not changed moist air too which formerly i thought pernicious gives me now no apprehensions for considering that no dampness of air applied to the outside of my skin can be equal to what is applied to and touches it within my whole body being full of moisture and finding that i can lie two hours in a bath twice a week covered with water which certainly is much damper than any air can be and this for years together without catching cold or being in any manner disordered by it i no longer dread mere moisture either in air or in sheets or shirts and i find it of importance to the happiness of life the being freed from vain terrors especially of objects that we are every day exposed inevitably to meet with you physicians have of late happily discovered after a contrary opinion had prevailed some ages that fresh and cool air does good to persons in the smallpox and other fevers it is to be hoped that in another century or two we may all find out that it is not bad even for people in health and as to moist air here i am at this present writing in a ship with above forty persons     who have had no other but moist air to breathe for six weeks past every thing we touch is damp and nothing dries yet we are all as healthy as we should be on the mountains of switzerland whose inhabitants are not more so than those of bermuda or st helena islands on whose rocks the waves are dashed into millions of particles which fill the air with damp but produce no diseases the moisture being pure unmixed with the poisonous vapors arising from putrid marshes and stagnant pools in which many insects die and corrupt the water these places only in my opinion which however i submit to yours afford unwholesome air and that it is not the mere water contained in damp air but the volatile particles or corrupted animal matter mixed with that water which renders such air pernicious to those who breathe it and i imagine it a cause of the same kind that renders the air in close rooms where the perspirable matter is breathed over and over again by a number of assembled people so hurtful to health after being in such a situation many find themselves affected by that febricula which the english alone call a cold and perhaps from the name imagine that they caught the malady by going out of the room when it was in fact by being in it you begin to think that i wander from my subject and go out of my depth so i return again to my chimneys we have of late many lecturers in experimental philosophy i have wished that some of them would study this branch of that science and give experiments in it as a part of their lectures the addition     to their present apparatus need not be very expensive a number of little representations of rooms composed each of five panes of sash glass framed in wood at the corners with proportionable doors and movable glass chimneys with openings of different sizes and different lengths of funnel and some of the rooms so contrived as to communicate on occasion with others so as to form different combinations and exemplify different cases with quantities of green wax taper cut into pieces of an inch and a half sixteen of which stuck together in a square and lit would make a strong fire for a little glass chimney and blown out would continue to burn and give smoke as long as desired with such an apparatus all the operations of smoke and rarefied air in rooms and chimneys might be seen through their transparent sides and the effects of winds on chimneys commanded or otherwise might be shown by letting the entering air blow upon them through an opened window of the lecturers chamber where it would be constant while he kept a good fire in his chimney by the help of such lectures our fumists would become better instructed at present they have generally but one remedy which perhaps they have known effectual in some one case of smoky chimneys and they apply that indiscriminately to all the other cases without success—but not without expense to their employers with all the science however that a man shall suppose himself possessed of in this article he may sometimes meet with cases that shall puzzle him i once lodged in a house at london which in a little     room had a single chimney and funnel the opening was very small yet it did not keep in the smoke and all attempts to have a fire in this room were fruitless i could not imagine the reason till at length observing that the chamber over it which had no fireplace in it was always filled with smoke when a fire was kindled below and that the smoke came through the cracks and crevices of the wainscot i had the wainscot taken down and discovered that the funnel which went up behind it had a crack many feet in length and wide enough to admit my arm a breach very dangerous with regard to fire and occasioned probably by an apparent irregular settling of one side of the house the air entering this breach freely destroyed the drawing force of of the funnel the remedy would have been filling up the breach or rather rebuilding the funnel but the landlord rather chose to stop up the chimney another puzzling case i met with at a friends country house near london his best room had a chimney in which he told me he never could have a fire for all the smoke came out into the room i flattered myself i could easily find the cause and prescribe the cure i had a fire made there and found it as he said i opened the door and perceived it was not the want of air i made a temporary contraction of the opening of the chimney and found that it was not its being too large that caused the smoke to issue i went out and looked up at the top of the chimney its funnel was joined in the same stack with others some of them shorter that drew very well and i saw nothing to prevent its     doing the same in fine after every other examination i could think of i was obliged to own the insufficiency of my skill but my friend who made no pretension to such kind of knowledge afterwards discovered the cause himself he got to the top of the funnel by a ladder and looking down found it filled with twigs and straw cemented by earth and lined with feathers it seems the house after being built had stood empty some years before he occupied it and he concluded that some large birds had taken the advantage of its retired situation to make their nest there the rubbish considerable in quantity being removed and the funnel cleared the chimney drew well and gave satisfaction in general smoke is a very tractable thing easily governed and directed when one knows the principles and is well informed of the circumstances you know i made it descend in my pennsylvania stove i formerly had a more simple construction in which the same effect was produced but visible to the eye plate fig   it was composed of two plates a b and c d placed as in the figure the lower plate a b rested with its edge in the angle made by the hearth with the back of the chimney the upper plate was fixed to the breast and lapped over the lower about six inches leaving a space of four inches wide and the length of the plates near two feet between them every other passage of air into the funnel was well stopped when therefore a fire was made at e for the first time with charcoal till the air in the funnel was a little heated through the plates and then wood laid on the smoke would rise     to a turn over the edge of that plate descend to d then turn under the edge of the upper plate and go up the chimney it was pretty to see but of no great use placing therefore the under plate in a higher situation i removed the upper plate c d and placed it perpendicularly plate fig   so that the upper edge of the lower plate a b came within about three inches of it and might be pushed farther from it or suffered to come nearer to it by a movable wedge between them the flame then ascending from the fire at e was carried to strike the upper plate made it very hot and its heat rose and spread with the rarefied air into the room i believe you have seen in use with me the contrivance of a sliding plate over the fire seemingly placed to oppose the rising of the smoke leaving but a small passage for it between the edge of the plate and the back of the chimney it is particularly described and its uses explained in my former printed letter and i mention it here only as another instance of the tractability of smoke  what is called the staffordshire chimney affords an example of the same kind the opening of the chimney is bricked up even with the fore edge of its jambs leaving open only a passage over the grate of the same width and perhaps eight inches high the grate consists of semicircular bars their upper bar of the greatest diameter the others under it smaller and smaller so that it has the appearance of half a round basket it is with the coals it contains wholly without the wall that shuts up the   0 chimney yet the smoke bends and enters the passage above it the draft being strong because no air can enter that is not obliged to pass near or through the fire so that all that the funnel is filled with is much heated and of course much rarefied much more of the prosperity of a winter country depends on the plenty and cheapness of fuel than is generally imagined in travelling i have observed that in those parts where the inhabitants can have neither wood nor coal nor turf but at excessive prices the workingpeople live in miserable hovels are ragged and have nothing comfortable about them but when fuel is cheap or where they have the art of managing it to advantage they are well furnished with necessaries and have decent habitations the obvious reason is that the working hours of such people are the profitable hours and they who cannot afford sufficient fuel have fewer such hours in the twentyfour than those who have it cheap and plenty for much of the domestic work of poor women such as spinning sewing knitting and of the men in those manufactures that require little bodily exercise cannot well be performed where the fingers are numbed with cold those people therefore in cold weather are induced to go to bed sooner and lie longer in a morning than they would do if they could have good fires or warm stoves to sit by and their hours of work are not sufficient to produce the means of comfortable subsistence those public works therefore such as roads canals etc by which fuel may be brought cheap into such countries from distant places are of great utility and those     who promote them may be reckoned among the benefactors of mankind i have great pleasure in having thus complied with your request and in the reflection that the friendship you honor me with and in which i have ever been so happy has continued so many years without the smallest interruption our distance from each other is now augmented and nature must soon put an end to the possibility of my continuing our correspondence but if consciousness and memory remain in a future state my esteem and respect for you my dear friend will be everlasting b franklin notes to the letter upon chimneys no i the latest work on architecture that i have seen is that entitled nutshells which appears to be written by a very ingenious man and contains a table of the proportions of the openings of chimneys but they relate solely to the proportions he gives his rooms without the smallest regard to the funnels and he remarks respecting those proportions that they are similar to the harmonic divisions of a monochord  he does not indeed lay much stress on this     but it shows that we like the appearance of principles and where we have not true ones we have some satisfaction in producing such as are imaginary no ii the description of the sliding plates here promised and which have been since brought into use under various names with some immaterial changes is contained in a former letter to james bowdoin as follows benjamin franklin   december      london james bowdoin london   december      dear sir— i have executed here an easy simple contrivance that i have long since had in speculation for keeping rooms warmer in cold weather than they generally are and with less fire it is this the opening of the chimney is contracted by brickwork faced with marble slabs to about two feet between the jambs and the breast brought down to within about three feet of the hearth an iron frame is placed just under the breast and extending quite to the back of the chimney so that a plate of the same metal may slide horizontally backwards and forwards in the grooves on each side of the frame this plate is just so large as to fill the whole space and shut the chimney entirely when thrust quite in which is convenient when there is no fire drawing it out so as to leave a space between its further edge and the back of about two inches this space is sufficient for the smoke to pass and so large a part of the funnel being stopped by the rest of the     plate the passage of warm air out of the room up the chimney is obstructed and retarded and by that means much cold air is prevented from coming in through crevices to supply its place this effect is made manifest in three ways first when the fire burns briskly in cold weather the howling or whistling noise made by the wind as it enters the room through the crevices when the chimney is open as usual ceases as soon as the plate is slid in to its proper distance secondly opening the door of the room about half an inch and holding your hand against the opening near the top of the door you feel the cold air coming in against your hand but weakly if the plate be in let another person suddenly draw it out so as to let the air of the room go up the chimney with its usual freedom where chimneys are open and you immediately feel the cold air rushing in strongly thirdly if something be set against the door just sufficient when the plate is in to keep the door nearly shut by resisting the pressure of the air that would force it open then when the plate is drawn out the door will be forced open by the increased pressure of the outward cold air endeavoring to get in to supply the place of the warm air that now passes out of the room to go up the chimney in our common open chimneys half the fuel is wasted and its effect lost the air it has warmed being immediately drawn off several of my acquaintance having seen this simple machine in my room have imitated it at their own houses and it seems likely to become pretty common i describe it thus particularly to you because     i think it would be useful in boston where firing is often dear mentioning chimneys puts me in mind of a property i formerly had occasion to observe in them which i have not found taken notice of by others it is that in the summertime when no fire is made in the chimneys there is nevertheless a regular draft of air through them continually passing upwards from about five or six oclock in the afternoon till eight or nine oclock the next morning when the current begins to slacken and hesitate a little for about half an hour and then sets as strongly down again which it continues to do till towards five in the afternoon then slackens and hesitates as before going sometimes a little up then a little down till in about a half an hour it gets into a steady upward current for the night which continues till eight or nine the next day the hours varying a little as the days lengthen and shorten and sometimes varying after from sudden changes in the weather as if after being long warm it should begin to grow cool about noon while air was coming down the chimney the current will then change earlier than the usual hour etc this property in chimneys i imagine we might turn to some account and render improper for the future the old saying as useless as a chimney in summer if the opening of the chimney from the breastwork down to the hearth be closed by a slight movable frame or two in the manner of doors covered with canvas that will let the air through but keep out the flies and another little frame set within     upon the hearth with hooks on which to hang joints of meat fowls etc wrapped well in wet linen cloths three or four fold i am confident that if the linen is kept wet by sprinkling it once a day the meat would be so cooled by the evaporation carried on continually by means of the passing air that it would keep a week or more in the hottest weather butter and milk might likewise be kept cool in vessels or bottles covered with wet cloths a shallow tray or keeler should be under the frame to receive any water that might drip from the wetted cloths i think too that this property of chimneys might by means of smokejack vanes be applied to some mechanical purpose where a small but pretty constant power only is wanted if you would have my opinion of the cause of this changing current of air in chimneys it is in short as follows in summer time there is generally a great difference in the warmth of the air at midday and midnight and of course a difference of specific gravity in the air as the more it is warmed the more it is rarefied the funnel of a chimney being for the most part surrounded by the house is protected in a great measure from the direct action of the suns rays and also from the coldness of the night air it thence preserves a middle temperature between the heat of the day and the coldness of the night this middle temperature it communicates to the air contained in it if the state of the outward air be cooler than that in the funnel of the chimney it will by being heavier force it to rise and go out at the top what supplies its place from below     being warmed in its turn by the warmer funnel is likewise forced up by the colder and weightier air below and so the current is continued till the next day when the sun gradually changes the state of the outward air makes it first as warm as the funnel of the chimney can make it when the current begins to hesitate and afterwards warmer then the funnel being cooler than the air that comes into it cools the air makes it heavier than the outward air and of course it descends and what succeeds it from above being cooled in its turn the descending current continues till towards evening when it again hesitates and changes its course from the change of warmth in the outward air and the nearly remaining same middle temperature in the funnel upon this principle if a house were built behind beacon hill an adit carried from one of the doors into the hill horizontally till it meet with a perpendicular shaft sunk from its top it seems probable to me that those who lived in the house would constantly in the heat even of the calmest day have as much cool air passing through the house as they should choose and the same though reversed in its current during the stillest night i think too this property might be made of use to miners as where several shafts or pits are sunk perpendicularly into the earth communicating at bottom by horizontal passages which is a common case if a chimney of thirty or forty feet high were built over one of the shafts or so near the shaft that the chimney might communicate with the top of the shaft all air being excluded but what should pass up     or down by the shaft a constant change of air would by this means be produced in the passages below tending to secure the workmen from those damps which so frequently incommode them for the fresh air would be almost always going down the open shaft to go up the chimney or down the chimney to go up the shaft let me add one observation more which is that if that part of the funnel of a chimney which appears above the roof of a house be pretty long and have three of its sides exposed to the heat of the sun successively viz when he is in the east in the south and in the west while the north side is sheltered by the building from the cool northerly winds such a chimney will often be so heated by the sun as to continue the draft strongly upwards through the whole twentyfour hours and often for many days together if the outside of such a chimney be painted black the effect will be still greater and the current stronger no iii it is said the northern chinese have a method of warming their ground floors which is ingenious those floors are made of tiles a foot square and two inches thick their corners being supported by bricks set on end that are a foot long and four inches square the tiles too join into each other by ridges and hollows along their sides this forms a hollow under the whole floor which on one side of the house has an opening into the air where a fire is made and it has a funnel rising from the other side to carry off the smoke the fuel is a sulphurous pit coal the     smell of which in the room is thus avoided while the floor and of course the room is well warmed but as the underside of the floor must grow foul with soot and a thick coat of soot prevents much of the direct application of the hot air to the tiles i conceive that burning the smoke by obliging it to descend through red coals would in this construction be very advantageous as more heat would be given by the flame than by the smoke and the floor being thereby kept free from soot would be more heated with less fire for this purpose i would propose erecting the funnel close to the grate so as to have only an iron plate between the fire and the funnel through which plate the air in the funnel being heated it will be sure to draw well and force the smoke to descend as in plate ii fig   where a is the funnel or chimney b the grate on which the fire is placed c one of the apertures through which the descending smoke is drawn into the channel d of figure  0 along which channel it is conveyed by a circuitous route as designated by the arrows until it arrives at the small aperture e through which it enters the funnel f g in both figures is the iron plate against which the fire is made which being heated thereby will rarefy the air in that part of the funnel and cause the smoke to ascend rapidly the flame thus dividing from the grate to the right and left and turning in passages disposed as in figure  0 so as that every part of the floor may be visited by it before it enters the funnel f by the two passages e e very little of the heat will be lost and a winter room thus rendered very comfortable     no iv page     few can imagine etc it is said the icelanders have very little fuel chiefly drift wood that comes upon their coast to receive more advantage from its heat they make their doors low and have a stage round the room above the door like a gallery wherein the women can sit and work the men read or write etc the roof being tight the warm air is confined by it and kept from rising higher and escaping and the cold air which enters the house when the door is opened cannot rise above the level of the top of the door because it is heavier than the warm air above the door and so those in the gallery are not incommoded by it some of our too lofty rooms might have a stage so constructed as to make a temporary gallery above for the winter to be taken away in summer sedentary people would find much comfort there in cold weather no v page   0 where they have the art of managing it etc in some houses of the lower people among the northern nations of europe and among the poorer sort of germans in pennsylvania i have observed this construction which appears very advantageous plate fig    a is the kitchen with its chimney b an iron stove in the stove room in a corner of the chimney is a hole through the back into the stove to put in fuel and another hole above it to let the smoke of the stove come back into the chimney as soon as the cooking is over the brands   0 in the kitchen chimney are put through the hole to supply the stove so that there is seldom more than one fire burning at a time in the floor over the stove room is a small trapdoor to let the warm air rise occasionally into the chamber thus the whole house is warmed at little expense of wood and the stove room kept constantly warm so that in the coolest winter nights they can work late and find the room still comfortable when they rise to work early an english farmer in america who makes great fires in large open chimneys needs the constant employment of one man to cut and haul wood for supplying them and the draft of cold air to them is so strong that the heels of his family are frozen while they are scorching their faces and the room is never warm so that little sedentary work can be done by them in winter the difference in this article alone of economy shall in the course of years enable the german to buy out the englishman and take possession of his plantation miscellaneous observations chimneys whose funnels go up in the north wall of a house and are exposed to the north winds are not so apt to draw well as those in a south wall because when rendered cold by those winds they draw downwards chimneys enclosed in the body of a house are better than those whose funnels are exposed in cold walls chimneys in stacks are apt to draw better than     separate funnels because the funnels that have constant fires in them warm the others in some degree that have none one of the funnels in a house i once occupied had a particular funnel joined to the south side of the stack so that three of its sides were exposed to the sun in the course of the day viz plate fig    the east side e during the morning the south side s in the middle part of the day and the west side w during the afternoon while its north side was sheltered by the stack from the cold winds this funnel which came from the ground floor and had a considerable height above the roof was constantly in a strong drawing state day and night winter and summer blacking of funnels exposed to the sun would probably make them draw still stronger in paris i saw a fireplace so ingeniously contrived as to serve conveniently two rooms a bedchamber and a study the funnel over the fire was round the fireplace was of castiron plate fig    having an upright back a and two horizontal semicircular plates b c the whole so ordered as to turn on the pivots d e the plate b always stopped that part of the round funnel that was next to the room without fire while the other half of the funnel over the fire was always open by this means a servant in the morning could make a fire on the hearth c then in the study without disturbing the master by going into his chamber and the master when he rose could with a touch of his foot turn the chimney on its pivots and bring the fire into his chamber keep     it there as long as he wanted it and turn it again when he went out into his study the room which had no fire in it was also warmed by the heat coming through the back plate and spreading in the room as it could not go up the chimney john bayard september         benjamin franklin mccclxxiv address of the assembly of pennsylvania to dr franklin  the representatives of the

paris the   th of july and agreeably to the permission of congress am returned to my own country mr jefferson had recovered his health and was much esteemed and respected there our joint letters have already informed you of our late proceedings to which i have nothing to add except that the last act i did as minister plenipotentiary for making treaties was to sign with him two days before i came away the treaty of friendship and commerce that had been agreed on with prussia  and which was to be carried to the hague by mr short there to be signed by baron thulemeier on the part of the king who without the least hesitation had approved and conceded to the new humane articles proposed by congress mr short was also to call at london for the signature of mr adams who i learned when at southampton was well received at the british court     the captain lamb who in a letter of yours to mr adams was said to be coming to us with instructions respecting morocco had not appeared nor had we heard any thing of him so nothing had been done by us in that treaty i left the court of france in the same friendly disposition towards the united states that we have all along experienced though concerned to find that our credit is not better supported in the payment of the interest money due on our loans which in case of another war must be they think extremely prejudicial to us and indeed may contribute to draw on a war the sooner by affording our enemies the encouraging confidence that those who take so little care to pay will not again find it easy to borrow i received from the king at my departure the present of his picture set round with diamonds usually given to ministers plenipotentiary who have signed any treaties with that court and it is at the disposition of congress to whom be pleased to present my dutiful respects i am with great esteem and regard etc b franklin p s—not caring to trust them to a common conveyance i send by my late secretary who will have the honor

where everybody wishes to see him in person but being told that it is not likely he ever will favor them with a visit they hope at least for a sight of his perfect resemblance by means of their principal statuary m houdon  whom mr jefferson and myself agreed with to come over for the purpose of taking a bust in order to make the intended statue for the state of virginia he is here but the materials and instruments he sent down the seine from paris not being arrived at havre when we sailed he was obliged to leave them and is now busied in supplying himself here as soon as that is done he proposes to wait on you in virginia as he understands there is no prospect of your coming     hither which would indeed make me very happy as it would give me an opportunity of congratulating with you personally on the final success of your long and painful labors in the service of our country which have laid us all under eternal obligations with the greatest and most sincere esteem and respect

frenchman it is with some degree of pain that i reflect on the     necessity which has caused you again to join your fellowcitizens who have desired to see you among them but the six years that i have passed in this country and the ties that i have formed here  have made me so much an american that i participate most sincerely in the joy which all the world is expressing at your return i am on the point of departing for st domingo and am extremely sorry that the short time remaining before that event deprives me of the pleasure of paying my respects to you in person at philadelphia i shall sail

what i have long ardently wished     and considering the growing infirmities of age began almost to despair of i am now in the bosom of my family and find four new little prattlers who cling about the knees of their grandpapa and afford me great pleasure the affectionate welcome i met with from my fellowcitizens was far beyond my expectation i bore my voyage very well and find myself rather better for it so that i have every possible reason to be satisfied with my having undertaken and performed it when i was at passy i could not bear a wheel carriage and being discouraged in my project of descending the seine in a boat by the difficulties and tediousness of its navigation in so dry a season i accepted the offer of one of the kings litters carried by large mules which brought me well though in walking slowly to havre thence i went over in a packetboat to southampton where i stayed four days till the ship came for me to spithead several of my london friends came there to see me particularly the good bishop of st asaph and family who stayed with me to the last in short i am now so well as to think it possible that i may once more have the pleasure of seeing you both perhaps at new york with my dear young friends who i hope may not have quite forgotten me for i imagine that on the sandy road between burlington and amboy i could bear an easy coach and the rest is water i

in the best manner i am able and  0  shall endeavor to render his stay as agreeable as i can it would give me infinite pleasure to see you at this place i dare not look for it though to entertain you under my own roof would be doubly gratifying when or whether i shall ever have the satisfaction of seeing you at philadelphia is uncertain as retirement from the public walks of life has not been so

friendship the ease and rest you wish me to enjoy for the remainder of my days is entirely what is most proper for me what i long wished for and what i proposed to myself in resigning my late employment but it is what i find i am not likely to obtain for my fellowcitizens having in a considerable body expressed their desire that i would still take a part in their public counsels assuring me it was the unanimous wish of the different parties that divide the state from an opinion that i might find some means of reconciling them i had not sufficient firmness to refuse their request of permitting their voting for me  0  as a councillor at the ensuing election though i apprehend they expect too much of me and that without doing the good proposed i shall find myself engaged again in business more troublesome than that i have lately quitted as to my health of which you kindly desire some information it is as well as at my age can reasonably be expected i have the stone indeed and sometimes the gout but the pain from the stone is hitherto not very severe and there are in the world so many worse maladies to which human nature is subject that i ought to be content with the moderate share allotted me be assured my dear friend that instead of repenting that i was your introducer into america i value myself on the share i had in procuring for it the acquisition of so useful and valuable a citizen i shall be very glad to see you when you happen to be again at philadelphia being with sincere esteem and affection dear sir your most obedient and most humble servant b

childs mccclxxxvi to mr francis childs printer at new york philadelphia   october      sir— i thank you for your kind congratulations on my return my printing materials consisting of a great variety of founts were sent down the seine some weeks before i left passy but were so long in their passage that when i came to havre they were not arrived and i was obliged to come away without them it was expected that the next packet would be ordered to sail from havre in which case i left directions that my packages should all be sent by her to new york when i hear of their arrival i may possibly come to new york and then we may treat on the subject you mention i have now only to add that i shall be glad of being serviceable to you on reasonable terms and am your humble servant b franklin john jay   october      new york benjamin franklin mccclxxxvii from john jay new york   october      dear sir— your grandson whom it gave me great pleasure to see delivered to me a few days ago  0  your kind letter of the   st of last month your being again with your family the manner in which the french court parted with you the attention you experienced from your english friends and the reception you met with from your fellowcitizens are circumstances that must give you great satisfaction it strikes me that you will find it somewhat difficult to manage the two parties in pennsylvania it is much to be wished that union and harmony may be reëstablished there and if you accomplish it much honor and many blessings will result from it unless you do it i do not know who can for independent of experience and talents you possess their confidence and your advice and measures must derive very great weight from the reputation and consideration you enjoy why your letters respecting your grandson have not been more efficacious i cannot explain the appointment of persons in the foreign department has in no instance been referred to me for my advice or opinion jealousy of power and influence in individuals as well as bodies of men seems to characterize the spirit of the times and has much operation both on men and measures we are happy to find that you think of visiting new york by the road from burlington to amboy which is smooth and but short you might doubtless come with very little inconvenience especially as you may travel at your leisure and take as many days as your ease and the weather may require mrs jay is exceedingly pleased with this idea and sincerely joins with me in wishing to see  0  it realized her attachments are strong and that to you being founded in esteem and the recollection of kind offices is particularly so i suspect your little friend has forgotten your person your name is familiar to her as indeed it will be to every generation with the best wishes i am dear sir your obliged and affectionate servant john jay m le veillard   october      passy benjamin franklin mccclxxxviii from m le veillard passy   october      my dear friend— we are waiting with the greatest impatience to hear from you the newspapers have given us anxiety on your account for some of them insist that you have been taken by the algerines while others pretend that you are at morocco enduring your slavery with all the patience of a philosopher these reports luckily have not been confirmed but we shall not be entirely at our ease until we see your handwriting dated at philadelphia you cannot imagine how sad we have felt ever since you have left us and how often we speak of you this we shall never cease to do there is even poor castor who never knows what to do with himself on sunday mornings we have again for a moment had fears of a war with the emperor he had some difficulty in coming to a final settlement with the dutch but  0  fortunately all is at last concluded and signed the king of prussia moreover who is in a fine position at this moment is at the head of a confederacy of almost all the states of germany to resist all attempts at aggrandizement on the part of the emperor as to your countrymen have they at last found a solid basis on which to rest their fabric can they sustain their liberty certainly they have great need of your wise counsels you will be astonished to hear that we have just arrested in his full dress and sent to the bastile a cardinal  who is a prince and bishop of strasburg this cardinal who has an income of more than twelve hundred thousand livres took from a jewellers on credit and on the queens account a diamond necklace worth one million six hundred thousand livres accused by her before the king he has produced a note which as he pretends he believed to have been written and signed by her his trial is going on before the parliament of paris and his sentence will be pronounced after the vacation he is in the uncomfortable dilemma of being able to prove that he is not a knave only by proving that he is a fool mademoiselle brillon is to be married on the  0th of this month to m viasal de malachet son of one

   philadelphia m le ray de chaumont mccclxxxix to m le ray de chaumont philadelphia  0 october      i make no apology for writing in english because i know my friend sophy can translate it for you  immediately after my landing i wrote to acquaint  0  you with my safe arrival and the absence of your son he is since returned in good health and writes to you by this opportunity of which he acquainted me i just now received your favor of august  0th with two for him they will be put in his hands as soon as he returns from a hunting party on which he is out at present with my son bache and some others but will be back here next sunday i thank you for delivering the tables to madame le veillard but more particularly for the present you have made to abbé morellet at my request of the doctoral chair he had taken a vast liking to it and the possession must give him great pleasure the marmite à vapeur i have with me here we used it at sea with great success though the water we boiled was salt as to finck the maitre dhotel he was fairly paid in money for every just demand he could make against us and we have his receipts in full but there are knaves in the world whom no writing can bind and when you think you have finished with them they come with demands after demands sans fin he was continually saying of himself je suis honnête homme je suis honnête homme but i always suspected he was mistaken and so it proves i hope your princes and princesses and duchesses and marquises are not birds of passage but will stay with you as we did through the winter so that you may pass it the more agreeably i will mention your project for transporting wood etc to some of my friends but i think this not the best part of the country for such an undertaking   0 gaetano filangieri    october      dalla cava benjamin franklin mcccxc from gaetano filangieri dalla cava    october      sir— the publication of three more volumes of my work affords me a new opportunity of testifying to you my respect and the attention due from me  your return to america so glorious to yourself and the great distance which separates us far from exempting me from this duty only renders the fulfilment of it the more praiseworthy by the difficulties and the obstacles which are to be surmounted i send you at present but a single copy of these three volumes because i do not know nor have i been able to ascertain from signor pio how many copies of the former volumes of my work he has forwarded you have only to inform me of the number and to give me the address of the person in france to whom the packet is to be directed and i will immediately send a similar number of copies of the volumes just published these contain the fourth book of the work which has for its subject the laws which concern education manners and public instruction my ideas on these subjects are certainly new but are they sound as to this point it belongs to you more than to any one else to decide may you enjoy sir the laurels to which your talents and your virtues so well entitle you the blessings invoked on your name by a great nation     are the only reward worthy of the author of their liberty and the avenger of their wrongs god grant that your years may be prolonged according to the wishes and the interests of that nation and that your advanced age may not prevent you from strengthening and perfecting and placing upon an eternal foundation by wise laws the work achieved by a just indignation and by valor i have the honor to subscribe myself in sincerity sir your most devoted and obedient servant gaetano filangieri benjamin franklin    october      philadelphia david hartley mcccxci to david hartley philadelphia    october      dear sir— i received at havre de grâce six copies of your print which i have brought with me hither i shall frame and keep one of them in my best room i shall send one to mr jay and give the others among some friends who esteem and respect you as we do your newspapers are filled with accounts of distresses and miseries that these states are plunged into since their separation from great britain you may believe me when i tell you that there is no truth in those accounts i find all property in lands and houses augmented vastly in value that of houses in towns at least fourfold the crops have been plentiful and yet the produce sells high to the     great profit of the farmer at the same time all imported goods sell at low rates some cheaper than the first cost working people have plenty of employ and high pay for their labor these appear to me as certain signs of public prosperity some traders indeed complain that trade is dead but this pretended evil is not an effect of inability in the people to buy pay for and consume the usual articles of commerce as far as they have occasion for them it is owing merely to there being too many traders who are crowded hither from all parts of europe with more goods than the natural demand of the country requires and what in europe is called the debt of america is chiefly the debt to these adventurers and supercargoes to their principals with which the settled inhabitants of america who never paid better for what they want and buy have nothing to do as to the contentment of the inhabitants with the change of government methinks a stronger proof cannot be desired than what they have given in my reception you know the part i had in that change and you see in the papers the addresses from all ranks with which your friend was welcomed home and the sentiments they contain confirmed yesterday in the choice of him for president by the council and new assembly which was unanimous a single voice in seventyseven excepted i remember you used to wish for newspapers from america herewith i send a few and you shall be regularly supplied if you can put me in a way of sending them so as that you may not be     obliged to pay postage with unchangeable esteem and respect i am my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin benjamin franklin  0 october      philadelphia mary hewson mcccxcii to mrs mary hewson philadelphia  0 october      i received my dear friends letter of july   d at southampton where i arrived the   th and stayed till the   th i believe i acquainted you by a line immediately after my arrival here that we had a pleasant and not a long passage in which there was but one day a day of violent storm in which i was glad you were not with us i had the happiness of finding my family well and of being very kindly received by my country folks i say nothing to persuade your coming because i said in a former letter i would leave you entirely to your own judgment which is very good i would only mention the fact that on inquiry i am informed the usual apprentice fee to a mercantile house of eminence is from one hundred to one hundred and fifty pounds sterling i am plunged again into public business as deep as ever and can now only add my love to the dear children in which this family all join temple is just gone to look at his lands and ben is at college to complete his studies i am ever my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin     benjamin franklin    november      philadelphia john bard bard mcccxciii to john bard and mrs bard philadelphia    november      dear friends— i received your kind letter which gave me much pleasure as it informed me of your welfare your friendly congratulations are very obliging i had on my return some right as you observe to expect repose and it was my intention to avoid all public business but i had not firmness enough to resist the unanimous desire of my country folks and i find myself harnessed again in their service for another year they engrossed the prime of my life they have eaten my flesh and seem resolved now to pick my bones you are right in supposing that i interest myself in every thing that affects you and yours sympathizing in your afflictions and rejoicing in your felicities for our friendship is ancient and was never obscured by the least cloud i thank you for your civilities to my grandson and am ever with sincere and great esteem and regard my dear friends yours most affectionately b franklin benjamin franklin    november      philadelphia mathon de la cour mcccxciv to mathon de la cour philadelphia    november      sir— i received duly the letter you did me the honor of writing to me on the   th of june past together with the collection you have made des comtes     rendus de vos contrôleurs généraux and your discours sur les moyens dencourager le patriotisme dans les monarchies the first is a valuable work as containing a great deal of useful information but the second i am particularly charmed with the sentiments being delightfully just and expressed with such force and clearness that i am persuaded the pamphlet though small must have a great effect on the minds of both princes and people and thence be productive of much good to mankind be pleased to accept my hearty thanks for both it is right to be sowing good seed whenever we have an opportunity since some of it may be productive an instance of this you should be acquainted with as it may afford you pleasure the reading of fortuné ricards testament has put it into the head and heart of a citizen to leave two thousand pounds sterling to two american cities who are to lend it in small sums at five per cent to young beginners in business and the accumulation after a hundred years to be laid out in public works of benefit to those cities  with great esteem i have the honor to be sir etc b franklin benjamin franklin    november      philadelphia edward bancroft mcccxcv to edward bancroft philadelphia    november      dear sir— i received your kind letter of september  th informing me of the intention mr dilly has     of printing a new edition of my writings and his desire that i would furnish him with such additions as i may think proper at present all my papers and manuscripts are so mixed with other things by the confusions occasioned in sudden and various removals during the late troubles that i can hardly find any thing but having nearly finished an addition to my house which will afford me room to put all in order i hope soon to be able to comply with such a request but i hope mr dilly will have a good understanding in the affair with henry and johnson who having risked the former impressions may suppose they thereby acquired some right to the copy as to the life proposed to be written if it be by the same hand who finished a sketch to dr lettsom which he sent me i am afraid it will be found too full of errors for either you or me to correct and having been persuaded by my friends messrs vaughan and m le veillard mr james of this place and some others that such a life written by myself may be useful to the rising generation i have made some progress in it and hope to finish it this winter so i cannot but wish that project of mr dillys biographer may be laid aside i am nevertheless thankful to you for your friendly offer of correcting it as to public affairs it is long since i gave over all expectations of a commercial treaty between us and britain and i think we can do as well or better without one than she can our harvests are plenty our produce fetches a high price in hard money and there are in every part of our country incontestable     marks of public felicity we discover indeed some errors in our general and particular constitutions which it is no wonder they should have the time in which they were formed being considered but these we shall soon mend the little disorders you have heard of in some of the states raised by a few wrong heads are subsiding and will probably soon be extinguished my best wishes and those of my family attend you we shall be happy to see you here when it suits you to visit us being with sincere and great esteem my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin jonathan shipley    november      twyford benjamin franklin mcccxcvi from jonathan shipley bishop of st asaph twyford    november      my dear friend— i felt myself much obliged to your worthy nephew mr williams for the account of your safe arrival and very honorable reception at philadelphia our last short interview at southampton was so much in mixed company and your hours were so entirely taken up with the final business of leaving this ungrateful country that i hardly found a single opportunity for the confidential information to which our old friendship seemed to entitle us and i on my part was very ready to give but to own the truth i had but little curiosity to know the particulars of your negotiations with either the french or the english ministers the     event has shown that in their own arts you were not inferior to the ablest of them i had much rather hear from you with what prudence and success your countrymen proceed in reviving and establishing that civil liberty which is extinguished everywhere else sure there never was opened so fine a field for making experiments and improvements in the philosophy of government which i take to be the noblest species of philosophy that can exercise the mind of man but your great blessing is that he who is best able to serve his country is sure of being rewarded make the most of the golden opportunity it has seldom lasted long i live in a very different scene where the most unprofitable and perhaps the most dangerous part a man can act is to mention the faults or propose any amendment in our corrupt and shattered frame of government yet i feel every day more reason to be pleased with the part i myself have acted but whether you had rather give us only an account of your domestic circumstances which i think must necessarily be happy i fancy you will give me credit for saying that nobody will be more warmly interested in what concerns you than the part of my family you saw at southampton mrs shipley and her daughter kitty in their passion for you rival georgiana they agree with me in interesting ourselves for all the worthy family party we met with you i wish your nephew and my old friend mr williams success in all his future views he can hardly undertake any business for which he is unqualified your promising grandson who has the     courage to tread in your early steps i hope will preserve the same generous emulation through his life few professions are in my eyes more respectable than the character of a printer who excels in his art aldus and stephens stand high as men of letters and made their learning and criticism subservient to their business let me hope that you will sometimes remember amidst the applauses of your countrymen that there is a family in england who love you as well as your own your ever affectionate j st asaph benjamin franklin   january      philadelphia james bowdoin mcccxcvii to james bowdoin philadelphia   january      my dear friend— it gave me great pleasure to receive your kind letter of congratulation as it proved that all my old friends in boston were not estranged from me by the malevolent misrepresentations of my conduct that had been circulated there but that one of the most esteemed still retained a regard for me indeed you are now almost the only one left me by nature death having since we were last together deprived me of my dear cooper winthrop and quincy i have not received the letter you mention to have sent me with some memoirs under cover to dr price i must have left europe before they got to his hands but he will doubtless send them to me by   0 the first convenient opportunity it was not necessary to make any apology for the liberty you say you have taken in those memoirs in making observations on my queries upon light for i am sure they will help me to understand it better and that must make them agreeable to me i shall be glad to see the whole volume  which you are so kind as to promise me and i hope in the course of a few months to be able to make returns in a second volume of our memoirs  now in the press i sent to you by mr gerry some weeks since dr jeffries account of his aërial voyage from england to france which i received from him just before i left that country in his letter that came with it he requests i would not suffer it to be printed because a copy of it had been put into the hands of sir joseph banks for the royal society and was to be read there in november if they should not think fit to publish it as i apprehend may be the case they having hitherto avoided meddling with the subject of balloons i shall be glad to have the minutes returned to me in the meantime i thought it might afford some amusement to you and to your society  my acquaintance with dr jeffries began by his bringing me a letter in france the first through the air from england with best wishes of many happy new years to you and good madam bowdoin i have the honor to be dear sir etc b franklin     benjamin franklin    january      philadelphia jane mecom mcccxcviii to mrs mecom philadelphia    january      my dear sister— i have received your letter of the  th inst with the recipe for making brown soap which is very clearly written and i thank you for it as well as for the account of our relations in new england who are more numerous than i imagined though i think you have omitted some unless they are all dead i mean a family at providence their names i forget but the mother was a daughter of our brother samuel or a granddaughter as to my health which you enquire after it is much the same as it has been for some years past the pains caused sometimes by the stone do not augment my appetite continues good and my temper generally cheerful my strength and activity diminishing indeed but by slow degrees i dont know what the answer was which chesterfield gave to his sons widow your letter to mr vernon seems to me very proper and well written and i think he was wrong in detaining the five dollars but when we consider that he was under no obligation to pay a debt contracted by his son we may be glad that we have recovered so much of it and that when it is so common to pay interest of an old debt in ill language he has paid you only in silence it is a family i have formerly been in friendship with and i would not have you trouble them with any further demands i have received a letter from the widow you     mention as having had a husband killed in hopkins fleet but she has sent me no vouchers on which i might found an application in her favor and i am afraid she has no other proof of the fact but a strong persuasion as she told me he was in the fleet as sure as i am now alive and lost his life in their cause and afterwards says i have waited near eight years in hopes he was taken and would return but now my hopes are all fled that he fell a victim in their cause i have not the least doubt it is strange that in eight years she had not been able to learn whether he had been killed or not and as the congress long since appointed commissions to examine and settle the claims of persons or the representations of persons who had served in their ships or armies which commissioners are doubtless provided with musterrolls of the several corps i wonder at her not having applied directly to them but there are people in the world—i have met with many such—who love to have a kind of pocket complaint always at hand with which they endeavor to procure compassion by exhibiting it everywhere and to everybody but those whose proper business it would be to redress it these they avoid lest their darling complaint being examined should be found to have no foundation i have written an answer to her letter which i enclose if you should have any future applications of this sort made to you to be handed to me i think you may avoid giving yourself any trouble with them by acquainting the people that i was absent all the war must be unacquainted with the facts am now at a distance from congress have     at present no connection with that body and that the application is more proper to be made to the delegates from their own state than to me my new alphabet is in a printed book of my pieces which i will send you the first opportunity i have by water the petition of z is enclosed i do not wonder at your blaming me for accepting the government we have all of us wisdom enough to judge what others ought to do or not to do in the management of their affairs and t is possible i might blame you as much if you were to accept the offer of a young husband my example may teach you not to be too confident in your own prudence as it teaches me not to be surprised at such an event should it really happen we all join in love etc and i am ever your affectionate brother b franklin benjamin franklin    january      philadelphia jonathan williams mcccxcix to jonathan williams philadelphia    january      dear jonathan— your bill for £    0s od has been presented and is accepted in my last of january   th i promised to send you some philosophical papers which i now enclose the three pieces i wrote at sea will all be printed in our transactions here that on chimneys is already done and perhaps i may send you the sheets with this the others will be done soon and printed copies will be better for you than written ones by ben     i wonder with you that the books are not arrived pray write and enquire about them when i put dr jeffries memoir into the hands of mr gerry i fancied he was going to boston or as a member of congress would send it free of postage but i see by the newspapers that he stays at new york to be married and perhaps that important transaction has put the packet out of his mind i am ever your affectionate uncle b franklin mcccc description of an instrument for taking down books from high shelves january      old men find it inconvenient to mount a ladder or steps for that purpose their heads being sometimes subject to giddinesses and their activity with the steadiness of their joints being abated by age besides the trouble of removing the steps every time a book is wanted from a different part of their library for a remedy i have lately made the following simple machine which i call the long arm a b the arm is a stick of pine an inch square and   feet long c d the thumb and finger are two pieces of ash lath an inch and half wide and a quarter of an inch thick these are fixed by wood screws on opposite sides of the end a of the arm a b the finger d being longer and standing out an inch and half farther than the thumb c the outside of the ends of these laths are pared off sloping     and thin that they may more easily enter between books that stand together on a shelf two small holes are bored through them at i k e f the sinew is a cord of the size of a small goosequill with a loop at one end when applied to the machine it passes through the two laths and is stopped by a knot in its other end behind the longest at k the hole at i is nearer the end of the arm than that at k     about an inch a number of knots are also on the cord distant three or four inches from each other  to use this instrument put one hand into the loop and draw the sinew straight down the side of the arm then enter the end of the finger between the book you would take down and that which is next to it the laths being flexible you may easily by a slight pressure sideways open them wider if the book is thick or close them if it is thin by pulling the string so as to enter the shorter lath or thumb between your book and that which is next to its other side then push till the back of your book comes to touch the string then draw the string or sinew tight which will cause the thumb and finger to pinch the book strongly so that you may draw it out as it leaves the other books turn the instrument a quarter round so that the book may lie flat and rest on its side upon the under lath or finger the knots on the sinew will help you to keep it tight and close to the side of the arm as you take it down hand over hand till the book comes to you which would drop from between the thumb and finger if the sinew was let loose all new tools require some practice before we can become expert in the use of them this requires very little made in the proportions above given it serves well for books in duodecimo or octavo quartos and folios are too heavy for it but those are usually placed on the lower shelves within reach of hand the book taken down may when done with be put up again into its place by the same machine     duke de la rochefoucauld   february      paris benjamin franklin mcccci from the duke de la rochefoucauld paris   february      my dear friend— i have heard of you through mr jefferson and m le veillard the latter showed me the letter in which you announced to him your nomination to the office of president and i admired the resolution which determined you to take upon yourself an employment so fatiguing but in which you can labor effectually for the happiness of pennsylvania and for that of the other states upon which the example of your own will assuredly have a great influence i know that two powerful and nearly equal parties support different principles as the basis of the constitution but nobody is better qualified than yourself to conciliate both of them and to obtain not perhaps the constitution most absolutely perfect but at least as solon said the best which your fellowcitizens are able to bear this is the critical moment for the americans the return of peace and the certainty of independence demand of them a general revision of their laws and the formation of new codes no longer a servile imitation of the laws of england but dictated by reason conformed to their actual situation and adapted to insure the happiness of states and individuals in legislation you must be the teachers of the world which is expecting from you some important lessons i will not trespass upon the time of so busy a man as yourself and will therefore close by offering you     the compliments of all my family to which m de condorcet requests me to add his that your life and health may be prolonged is the unanimous prayer of all those who have ever heard of you all who have had the satisfaction of knowing you add the hope that they may retain a place in your friendship i venture to believe that i deserve this by the sincere attachment and veneration which i feel for you duke de la rochefoucauld marquis de lafayette  0 february      paris benjamin franklin mccccii from the marquis de lafayette paris  0 february      my dear friend— with unspeakable satisfaction i have heard of your safe arrival in america and heartily wished i had been mingled in the happy crowd of your fellowcitizens when they saw you set your foot on the shore of liberty when your friends in paris meet together their first talk is of you the wishes for you of a fortunate voyage and pleasing sight of your family and friends became a national sentiment in my tour through germany i have been asked a thousand questions about you when i felt equally proud and happy to boast of our affectionate intimacy prussia and the austrian dominions with some parts of the german empire the liberties of which have been so much spoken of in treaties and so little     felt by the people have been the object of my very agreeable journey  the first class of people are i found misinformed with respect to american affairs what may be wrong they know perfectly with an addition of a thousand falsehoods and i wish no ground was left for our enemies to found those falsehoods upon although they have an enthusiastic admiration of the virtues displayed by america during the war yet it is a matter of doubt with them some sensible and feeling men excepted particularly prince henry if free constitutions can support themselves the king of prussia himself is blinded by habit and prejudices that monarchs temper is very bad the emperors not very quiet but the affairs of great britain being embarrassed and our politics very pacific i do not think any storm is to be feared i have been happy to hear you have accepted the presidency of pennsylvania nothing but that could speedily restore internal union and remove the jealousies against neighbors you will encourage federal measures regulations for trade a general system of militia and the more i learn the opinions of foreign nations the more i wish for such arrangements the necessity of which is obvious to almost every american a committee consisting of the intendants of finance counsellors of state and farmersgeneral has been appointed to consider the affairs of american commerce i shall attend   0 regularly but as it is just begun i cannot tell whether it will be very useful enclosed i send you a vocabulary which the empress of russia requests may be filled up with indian words you know her plan of a universal dictionary i have thought you might send me the delaware and shawanese languages with some others your commissioners for indian affairs colonel harmar and general butler will be able to superintend the business which it is important to have well done as the empress although i think to very little purpose sets a great value upon it  be so kind as to remember me most affectionately to your family daughter grandsons soninlaw and to all our friends in philadelphia my heart has been long opened to you and i need not assure you that with the highest regard and tenderest affection i have the honor etc lafayette benjamin franklin    february      philadelphia jonathan williams mcccciii to jonathan williams philadelphia    february      dear jonathan— i have written twice to you lately but am obliged to trouble you with another line to request from you a copy of the account you took during our last voyage of the temperature of     the water for i cannot find that i have such a copy and i want it to add to my nautical letter now in the press so that i wish you to favor me with it as speedily as possible and now i am writing it comes into my mind to enquire of you what light you find me to stand in among my country folks my late friends dr cooper and mr quincy gave me friendly notices of the calumnies propagated against me which appeared all to emanate from the brantry focus if they still exist i would furnish you with a copy of my justification which i sent to dr cooper but it probably did not reach boston before his death you see that old as i am i am not yet grown insensible with respect to reputation though as i may possibly never be able again to visit boston how much soever i may wish to do it and sometimes resolve upon it my character there is of somewhat less importance how has my poor old sister gone through the winter tell me frankly whether she lives comfortably or is pinched for i am afraid she is too cautious of acquainting me with all her difficulties though i am always ready and willing to relieve her when i am acquainted with them my love to your parents and the rest of the family and to our young fellow traveller who i hope will make a fine man i am ever etc b franklin     benjamin franklin    february      philadelphia shipley mcccciv to dr shipley bishop of st asaph philadelphia    february      dear friend— i received lately your kind letter of november   th my reception here was as you have heard very honorable indeed but i was betrayed by it and by some remains of ambition from which i had imagined myself free to accept of the chair of government for the state of pennsylvania when the proper thing for me was repose and a private life i hope however to be able to bear the fatigue for one year and then to retire i have much regretted our having so little opportunity for conversation when we last met  you could have given me information and counsels that i wanted but we were scarce a minute together without being broken in upon i am to thank you however for the pleasure i had after our parting in reading the new book  you gave me which i think generally well written and likely to do good though the reading time of most people is of late so taken up with newspapers and little periodical pamphlets that few nowadays venture to attempt reading a quarto volume i have admired to see that in the last century a folio burton on melancholy went through six editions in about twenty years we have i believe more readers now but not of such large books you seem desirous of knowing what progress we     make here in improving our government we are i think in the right road of improvement for we are making experiments i do not oppose all that seem wrong for the multitude are more effectually set right by experience than kept from going wrong by reasoning with them and i think we are daily more and more enlightened so that i have no doubt of our obtaining in a few years as much public felicity as good government is capable of affording your newspapers are filled with fictitious accounts of anarchy confusion distresses and miseries we are supposed to be involved in as consequences of the revolution and the few remaining friends of the old government among us take pains to magnify every little inconvenience a change in the course of commerce may have occasioned to obviate the complaints they endeavor to excite was written the enclosed little piece from which you may form a truer idea of our situation than your own public prints would give you and i can assure you that the great body of our nation find themselves happy in the change and have not the smallest inclination to return to the domination of britain there could not be stronger proof of the general approbation of the measures that promoted the change and of the change itself than has been given by the assembly and council of this state in the nearly unanimous choice of their governor of one who had been so much concerned in those measures the assembly being themselves the unbribed choice of the people and therefore may be truly supposed of the same sentiments i say nearly unanimous because of     between seventy and eighty votes there were only my own and one other in the negative as to my domestic circumstances of which you kindly desire to hear something they are at present as happy as i could desire them i am surrounded by my offspring a dutiful and affectionate daughter in my house with six grandchildren the eldest of whom you have seen who is now at a college in the next street finishing the learned part of his education the others promising both for parts and good dispositions what their conduct may be when they grow up and enter the important scenes of life i shall not live to see and i cannot foresee i therefore enjoy among them the present hour and leave the future to providence he that raises a large family does indeed while he lives to observe them stand as watts says a broader mark for sorrow but then he stands a broader mark for pleasure too when we launch our little fleet of barks into the ocean bound to different ports we hope for each a prosperous voyage but contrary winds hidden shoals storms and enemies come in for a share in the disposition of events and though these occasion a mixture of disappointment yet considering the risk where we can make no insurance we should think ourselves happy if some return with success my sons son temple franklin whom you have also seen having had a fine farm of six hundred acres conveyed to him by his father when we were at southampton has dropped for the present his views of acting in the political line and applies himself ardently to the     study and practice of agriculture this is much more agreeable to me who esteem it the most useful the most independent and therefore the noblest of employments his lands are on navigable water communicating with the delaware and but about sixteen miles from this city he has associated to himself a very skilful english farmer lately arrived here who is to instruct him in the business and partakes for a term of the profits so that there is a great apparent probability of their success you will kindly expect a word or two concerning myself my health and spirits continue thanks to god as when you saw me the only complaint i then had does not grow worse and is tolerable i still have enjoyment in the company of my friends and being easy in my circumstances have many reasons to like living but the course of nature must soon put a period to my present mode of existence this i shall submit to with the less regret as having seen during a long life a good deal of this world i feel a growing curiosity to be acquainted with some other and can cheerfully with filial confidence resign my spirit to the conduct of that great and good parent of mankind who created it and who has so graciously protected and prospered me from my birth to the present hour wherever i am i hope always to retain the pleasing remembrance of your friendship being with sincere and great esteem my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin ps—we all join in respects to mrs shipley and best wishes for the whole amiable family     benjamin franklin    february      philadelphia mccccv printing types made at passy philadelphia    february      i do hereby certify to whom it may concern that the printing types with which i have furnished mr francis child contained in fifteen boxes marked b f no    0                                      0 were made in my house at passy by my servants for my use and were never the property of any european letterfounder manufacturer or merchant whatsoever b franklin late minister for the united states at the court of france benjamin franklin   march      philadelphia m grand mccccvi to mr grand the amsterdam banker philadelphia   march      dear friend— since my last which was of jan   th i have had the great pleasure of receiving yours of oct  0    by which i learned that yourself and the good family continued well the vessel from havre after a long passage of about twelve weeks arrived at last with all my things in pretty good order and sundry parcels of books etc from you when i had almost given over all hopes of seeing them ever again so that i now find myself happily situated in my own house surrounded by my offspring     with all my playthings and amusements about me and my malady not augmented but still continuing tolerable i have drawn upon you lately for     l  0 tournois in favor of ross and vaughan my former drafts since my arrival here were for £ 00 sterling    0 livres tournois and £ 00 sterling i hope now to receive soon your account completing the last year and that you have been paid my dividend on my stock in the funds i suppose my grandson will write to you by this conveyance though he is now very busy in preparing to settle on his farm which is a very good one about sixteen miles from this town water carriage to his door very convenient for bringing his produce to market benjamin is at college and applies close to his studies he presents his respects i rejoice to hear that the emperor and the dutch have accommodated their differences long may the peace of europe continue for i am of opinion that there never was a bad peace nor a good war and i think your minister who is so expert in composing quarrels and preventing wars the great blessing of this age the devil must send us three or four heroes before he can get as much slaughter of mankind done as that one man has prevented i do not understand how caliastro was involved in the affair of the cardinal and have some curiosity to know his history when it shall be developed the english papers not only sent me gratis as you observe to algiers but they are sending all the united states to destruction by their accounts you     would think we were in the utmost distress in want of every thing all in confusion no government and wishing again for that of england be assured my friend that these are all fictions mere english wishes not american realities there are some few faults in our constitutions which is no wonder considering the stormy season in which they were made but those will soon be corrected and for the rest i never saw greater and more indubitable marks of public prosperity in any country the produce of our agriculture bears a good price and is all paid for in ready hard money all the laboring people have high wages everybody is well clothed and well lodged the poor provided for or assisted and all estates in town and country much increased in value as to wishing for the english government we should as soon wish for that of morocco be so good as to forward the letters you will receive herewith and charge me with the expense my love to all the good family and believe me ever my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin benjamin franklin   march      philadelphia m le veillard mccccvii to m le veillard philadelphia   march      my dear friend— i received and read with great pleasure your kind letter of october  th it informed me of your welfare and that of the best of good women and of her amiable daughter who i think     will tread in her steps my effects came all in the same ship in good order and we are now drinking every day les eaux épurées de passy with great satisfaction as they kept well and seem to be rendered more agreeable by the long voyage i am here in the bosom of my family and am not only happy myself but have the felicity of seeing my country so be assured that all the stories spread in the english papers of our distresses and confusions and discontents with our new governments are as chimerical as the history of my being in chains at algiers they exist only in the wishes of our enemies america never was in higher prosperity her produce abundant and bearing a good price her working people all employed and well paid and all property in lands and houses of more than treble the value it bore before the war and our commerce being no longer the monopoly of british merchants we are furnished with all the foreign commodities we need at much more reasonable rates than heretofore so that we have no doubt of being able to discharge more speedily the debt incurred by the war than at first was apprehended our modes of collecting taxes are indeed as yet imperfect and we have need of more skill in financiering but we improve in that kind of knowledge daily by experience that our people are contented with the revolution with their new constitutions and their foreign connections nothing can afford a stronger proof than the universally cordial and joyous reception with which they welcomed the return of one that was supposed to have had a considerable   0 share in promoting them all this is in answer to that part of your letter in which you seem to have been too much impressed with some of the ideas which those lying english papers endeavor to inculcate concerning us i am astonished by what you write concerning the prince evêque if the charges against him are made good it will be another instance of the truth of those proverbs which teach us that prodigality begets necessity that without economy no revenue is sufficient and that it is hard for an empty sack to stand upright i am glad to hear of the marriage of mademoiselle brillon for every thing that may contribute to the happiness of that beloved family gives me pleasure be pleased to offer them my felicitations and assure them of my best wishes will you also be so good as to present my respectful compliments to madame la duchesse denville and to m le duc de la rochefoucauld you may communicate the political part of this letter to that excellent man his good heart will rejoice to hear of the welfare of america i made no progress when at sea in the history you mention  but i was not idle there having written three pieces each of some length one on nautical matters another on chimneys and a third a description of my vase for consuming smoke with directions for using it these are all now printing in the transactions of our philosophical society of which i hope soon to send you a copy b franklin     my grandsons present their compliments the eldest is very busy in preparing for a country life being to enter upon his farm the   th instant it consists of about six hundred acres bounding on navigable water sixteen miles from philadelphia the youngest is at college very diligent in his studies you know my situation involved in public cares but they cannot make me forget that you and i love one another and that i am ever my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin benjamin franklin  0 march      philadelphia m grand mccccviii to mr grand philadelphia  0 march      dear friend— i wrote to you on the  th instant and the vessel not being yet gone i add a few lines to give you a little trouble in requesting you to receive and divide among some of my friends a few hams jambons and some cakes of our soap the hams are in a cask and have labels to denote who are sic they are for i send them because strangers here admire them for their good taste and the sweetness of their fat which is all made by their feeding on maize and i hope they will come good to hand the soap is thought to be the best in the world for shaving and for washing chinces sic and other things of delicate colors please to divide them as follows      cakes  cake for made grand   m chabanis   sir geo grand   m le roy

dont forget to charge me with the expenses i put you to for carriage postage etc benjamin franklin march      philadelphia benjamin rush mccccix to benjamin rush philadelphia march      my dear friend— during our long acquaintance you have shown many instances of your regard for     me yet i must now desire you to add one more to the number which is that if you publish your ingenious discourse on the moral sense you will totally omit and suppress that most extravagant encomium on your friend franklin which hurt me exceedingly in the unexpected hearing and will mortify me beyond conception if it should appear from the press confiding in your compliance with this earnest request i am ever my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin  benjamin franklin  0 march      philadelphia thomas jefferson mccccx to thomas jefferson philadelphia  0 march      sir— i received your favor of october  th by messrs fitzhughs with the letters and pacquets you were so kind as to forward to me by those gentlemen who have wintered with us and are but lately set out for virginia i will read de plessis papers as soon as i can find a little time and say something of them in a future letter     as to public affairs the congress has not been able to assemble more than seven or eight states during the whole winter so the treaty with p remains still unratified though there is no doubt of its being done soon as a full congress is expected next month the disposition to furnish congress with ample powers augments daily as people become more enlightened and i do not remember ever to have seen during my long life more signs of public felicity than appear at present throughout these states the cultivators of the earth who make the bulk of our nation having had good crops which are paid for at high prices with ready money the artisans too receive high wages and the value of all real estate is augmented greatly merchants and shopkeepers indeed complain that there is not business enough but this is evidently not owing to the fewness of buyers but to the too great number of sellers for the consumption of goods was never greater as appears by the dress furniture and manner of living of all ranks of the people as to myself i am agreeable to your kind wishes happy in the bosom of my friends and family enjoying as good health as ever the stone excepted which does not grow worse be pleased to present my affectionate respects to the good countess dhonditot who you say does me the honor to enquire concerning me and i pray you to assure all other enquiring friends that i retain and shall ever retain the deepest impression of their many kindnesses to me while i resided among them i hope your health is fully established my best wishes attend you being with     great and sincere esteem dear sir your most obedient and most humble servant b franklin benjamin franklin    march      philadelphia roberdeau mccccxi to general roberdeau philadelphia    march      dear sir— i received your favor proposing to sell me your plantation in this country which i should have answered sooner if i could sooner have been informed of its qualities quantity of acres price and the rent it affords for not being in a condition to enjoy a country seat since my malady the stone does not permit me to ride either on horseback or in a wheel carriage i have no inducement to purchase land but a prospect of its producing greater profit than money at interest it is but the other day that the gentleman you referred me to called to give me what information he could which having considered i apprehend the purchase will not suit my views so that i must wish you a better chapman with great esteem i have the honor to be dear sir your most obedient and most humble servant b franklin benjamin franklin april      philadelphia m labbé de la roche mccccxii to m labbé de la roche philadelphia april      my dear friend— i confess that i am a little mutilated as a correspondent i wish to hear from     my friends by every pacquet and presume they may excuse me if i write once a year the only apology i can make and that not a very good one is that indolence is natural to age and that i am too much engaged in business but i have too long omitted writing to my friends at auteuil i throw myself on their good nature and beg their forgiveness the continued kindness towards me expressed in their letters affected me much and i never perused those letters but with fresh pleasure mixed with the remembrance of the many delightful hours i passed in that sweet society and the regret with which i find myself forever separated from it i wrote in november last to the archbishop of bordeaux and executed his commission so far as to send him the seeds he desired which i hope arrived in good order though i have not since heard from him the kind of wooden houses he wrote for are not usually made here though possibly they may at boston but that being remote from me so that i could not have the least inspection of the workmen i have advised his writing to the french consul who resides there and send him an exact plan of the buildings with all their proportions the description in the letter you sent me not being sufficiently precise to be intelligible by our ignorant carpenters who therefore could not compute the cost it is rare that we see the cardinal bird so far north as pennsylvania those sent here from virginia generally perish by the way being a tender bird and not well bearing the sea so that we have not hitherto been able to get any for benjamin to take care of     mr alexander has i understand sent several for our dame in his tobacco ships to france which never arrived and unless a friend was going in the ship who would take more than common care of them i suppose one might send a hundred without landing one alive they would be very happy i know if they were once under her protection but they cannot come to her and she will not come to them she may remember the offer i made her of  000 acres of woodland out of which she might cut a great garden and have  000 aviaries if she pleased i have a large tract on the ohio where cardinals are plenty if i had been a cardinal myself perhaps i might have prevailed with her i am much obliged by her kind offer of sending robes hats bonnets and other french modes to my good daughter the mother of benjamin to whose filial care of me and attention to me i owe much of my present happiness enclosed i send her commission which if notre dame will be so good as to execute with her usual good taste and judgment mr grand will immediately pay the bill and i shall be very thankful you have as we hear an assembly of notables to confer and advise on the amendment of your laws and constitutions of government it is remarkable that we should have the same project here at the same time our assembly is to meet next month i pray god that success may attend the deliberations of both assemblies for the happiness of both nations my health continues much in the same state as when i left france my old malady not growing worse so that i am able to go through a good deal     of business and enjoy the conversation of my friends as usual your project of transporting rather than drowning the good ladys eighteen cats is very humane the kind treatment they experience from their present mistress may possibly cause an unwillingness to hazard the change of situation but if they are of the angora breed and can be informed how two of their tribe brought over by my grandson are caressed and almost adored here they may possibly be induced to transport themselves rather than risque any longer the persecution of the abbés which sooner or later must end in their condemnation their requêté is admirably well written but their continually increasing in number will in time make their cause insupportable their friends should therefore advise them to submit voluntarily either to transport or to castration the remarks of a grammarian on the particle on are full of wit and just satire my friends here who understand french have been highly entertained with them they will do good if you publish them they have had some effect upon me as you will see in this letter for when i spoke of the prosperous state of our affairs here fearing you might suppose that i thought all well because i myself had a profitable place i found it proper to add other reasons your taking the pains of translating the addresses is a strong mark of the continuance of your friendship for me which gave me as much pleasure as the addresses themselves had done and that you may well believe was not a little for indeed the reception     i met with on my arrival far exceeded my expectation popular favor not the most constant thing in the world still continues with regard to me my election to the presidentship for the second year being unanimous whether it will hold out to the end of the third is uncertain a man in high place has so many occasions which he cannot avoid of disobliging if he does his duty and those he disobliges have so much more resentment than those he obliges has gratitude that it often happens when he is strongly attacked he is weakly defended you will therefore not wonder if you should hear that i do not finish my political career with the same eclat that i began it it grieves me to learn that you have been afflicted with sickness it is as you say the condition of living but it seems a hard condition i sometimes wonder that all good men and women are not by providence kept free from pain and disease in the best of all possible worlds i should suppose it must be so and i am piously inclined to believe that this worlds not being better made was owing merely to the badness of the materials embrace for me tenderly the good dame whom i love as ever i thought to have written to her and to mr cab nis cabenis  by the pacquet but must defer it to the next for want of time i am my dear friend with sincere esteem and affection yours ever b franklin please to present my respects to m le roy and others of the wednesdays dining party and love to   0 the stars and to your family my grandson joins me in best wishes benjamin franklin   april      philadelphia jane mecom mccccxiii to mrs jane mecom philadelphia   april      dear sister— i received your kind letter of the   st of february i have also received the box of soap the substance of which appears to be very good but its consistence had probably been affected by the frost for unless very tenderly and cautiously handled the cakes would crumble into little pieces between ones fingers however having an opportunity of sending some to my friends in france who much admired what i had of you formerly i with much difficulty took out    cakes which i wrapped separately in spongy paper hoping that as they dried they might consolidate and the infinite number of little cracks that appeared in them be closed and the parts again united and so i sent them away in a small box but having since dried a cake very gradually i fear i shall be disappointed in that expectation for it seems as crumbly as before and comes to pieces in the water so that i am sorry that i sent any of it away till i had consulted you upon it who probably must have met with the like accident before and might know of some remedy business having prevented my writing sally has been making an experiment she put   or   pounds of the crumbs about the size of chestnuts into a     little kettle with some water and over a slow fire melted them together and when the whole was uniformly fluid laded it out into little paper pans of the size of the cakes these grew stiff when cold but were rather soft and shrunk greatly in drying being now dry they are exceedingly hard closegrained and solid and appear to have all the qualities of excellent crown soap only in drying they are twisted and warped out of shape wherefore i have not continued the process on the rest of the box but was resolved to send you this particular account thinking you may possibly teach me a better method capt all is just arrived here who has given me the pleasure of hearing that you were very well a few weeks since he says he does not remember you to have ever looked better or to be more active i continue much as i have been for some time past and am always your affectionate brother b franklin draw upon me for the expense of the soap and your bill shall be paid on sight benjamin franklin april         philadelphia jane mecom mccccxiv to mrs jane mecom philadelphia april         dear sister— i wrote you a long letter lately about the soap which i supposed to have become crumbly by means of frost and acquainting you that we had made some of the crumbs solid again by     remelting them with water i further requested your advice whether to remelt it all and in what manner that you may better understand the case i send you herewith some of the crumbly soap and a piece of that which we consolidated by remelting the crumbs but since i wrote that letter i find that a few of the cakes which appeared ready to fall to pieces being set separately on their edges upon a shelf in a closet to dry gradually seem now to have become very firm and i have therefore this day taken all out of the box and set them to dry in the same slow manner perhaps they may all grow firm and make the remelting unnecessary i send also with this one of the books in which is printed my proposal of a new alphabet which you desired to see i am ever your affectionate brother b franklin benjamin franklin   may      philadelphia mary hewson mccccxv to mrs mary hewson philadelphia   may      my dear friend— a long winter has past and i have not had the pleasure of a line from you acquainting me with you and your childrens welfare since i left england i suppose you have been in yorkshire out of the way and knowledge of opportunities for i will not think that you have forgotten me to make me some amends i received a few days     past a large packet from mr williams dated september      near ten years since containing three letters from you one of december         this packet had been received by mr bache after my departure for france lay dormant among his papers during all my absence and has just now broke out upon me like words that had been as somebody says congealed in northern air therein i find all the pleasing little family history of your children how william had begun to spell overcoming by strength of memory all the difficulty occasioned by the common wretched alphabet while you were convinced of the utility of our new one how tom geniuslike struck out new paths and relinquishing the old names of the letters called u bell and p bottle how eliza began to grow jolly that is fat and handsome resembling aunt rooke whom i used to call my lovely together with all the then news of lady blounts having produced at length a boy of dollys being well and of poor good catherines decease of your affairs with muir and atkinson and of their contract for feeding the fish in the channel of the vinys and their jaunt to cambridge in the long carriage of dollys journey to wales with mrs scott of the wilkeses the pearces elphinstones etc—concluding with a kind of promise that as soon as the ministry and congress agreed to make peace i should have you with me in america that peace has been some time made but alas the promise is not yet fulfilled i have found my family here in health good circumstances and well respected by their fellowcitizens     the companions of my youth are indeed almost all departed but i find an agreeable society among their children and grandchildren i have public business enough to preserve me from ennui and private amusement besides in conversation books my garden and cribbage considering our wellfurnished plentiful market as the best of gardens i am turning mine in the midst of which my house stands into grass plots and gravel walks with trees and flowering shrubs cards we sometimes play here in long winter evenings but it is as they play at chess not for money but for honor or the pleasure of beating one another this will not be quite a novelty to you as you may remember we played together in that manner during the winter at passy i have indeed now and then a little compunction in reflecting that i spend time so idly but another reflection comes to relieve me whispering you know that the soul is immortal why then should you be such a niggard of a little time when you have a whole eternity before you so being easily convinced and like other reasonable creatures satisfied with a small reason when it is in favor of doing what i have a mind to i shuffle the cards again and begin another game as to public amusements we have neither plays nor operas but we had yesterday a kind of oratorio as you will see by the enclosed paper and we have assemblies balls and concerts besides little parties at one anothers houses in which there is sometimes dancing and frequently good music so that we jog on in life as pleasantly as you do in england anywhere     but in london for there you have plays performed by good actors that however is i think the only advantage london has over philadelphia temple has turned his thoughts to agriculture which he pursues ardently being in possession of a fine farm that his father lately conveyed to him ben is finishing his studies at college and continues to behave as well as when you knew him so that i think he will make you a good son his younger brothers and sisters are also promising appearing to have good tempers and dispositions as well as good constitutions as to myself i think my general health and spirits rather better than when you saw me the particular malady i then complained of continues tolerable with sincere and very great esteem i am ever my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin p s—my children and grandchildren join with me in best wishes for you and yours my love to my godson to eliza and to honest tom they will all find agreeable companions here love to dolly and tell her she will do well to come with you benjamin franklin  0 may      philadelphia mary hewson mccccxvi to mrs mary hewson philadelphia  0 may      dear polly— i have just received your kind letter of april  d which made me some amends for     your long silence by the last ship from hence i wrote to you acknowledging the receipt of some very old letters when i was sorry i could mention none of later date i have however no right to complain being so bad a correspondent myself but my last was a long one and i hope you have received it you seem now inclined to come over if you could meet with a captain that you know and like we mentioned it to captain falconer he goes no more to sea but strongly recommends captain willet who carries this letter as a good man and excellent seaman his ship is the harmony which lately brought over mr and mrs bingham mr williams will hardly i doubt be with you in time this year to assist in your embarkation but if you apply to messrs johnson  co american merchants to whom i write i am persuaded they will make the bargain for you and assist you with their advice in every circumstance temple who presents his respects has however no hopes of your coming he says you were so long irresolute and wavering about the journey to paris that he thinks it unlikely you will decide firmly to make the voyage to america i enclose a truer state of affairs in our country than your public prints will afford you and i pray god guide you this family are all well and join in love to you and yours with your affectionate b franklin p s—captain willet is to leave london on his return about the  st of august your son ben and     all his family join in the hope of your resolving to come over  william cocke    june      benjamin franklin mccccxvii from william cocke state of franklin    june      sir— i make no doubt but you have heard that the good people of this country have declared themselves a separate state from north carolina and that as a testimony of the high esteem they have for the many important and faithful services you have rendered to your country they have called the name of their state after you i presume you have also heard the reasons on which our separation is founded some of which are as follows that north carolina had granted us a separation on certain wellknown conditions expressed in an act of the general assembly of that state which conditions we think she had no right to break through without our consent as well as the consent of congress we therefore determine strictly to adhere to the conditions expressed in said act and doubt not but congress will be uniform in their just demands as well as honorable in complying with their resolve to confirm all the just claims of such persons as have purchased land under the laws of north carolina for which they have paid that state the confidence we have in the wisdom and justice of the united states inclines us to leave every matter     of dispute to their decision and i am expressly empowered and commanded to give the united states full assurance that we shall act in obedience to their determination provided north carolina will consent that they shall become the arbiters i had set out with the intention to wait on congress to discharge the duties of the trust reposed in me but i am informed that congress will adjourn about the last of this month and i will thank you to be so kind as to favor me with a few lines by the bearer mr rogers to inform me when congress will meet again and shall be happy to have your sentiments and advice on so important a subject i have the honor to be etc william cocke benjamin franklin    june      philadelphia charles thomson mccccxviii to charles thomson philadelphia    june      dear sir— i received in time your favor of the   th past with an extract from the contract made at versailles february         this extract being a translation i have spent some time in searching for a copy i supposed i might have the original but have not yet met with it and will now no longer delay my answer which is that if the translation be just and the original mentions three millions as given before the treaty of      it has either been a mistake of one million or the million received from the farmersgeneral is included as a don gratuit of     the king in which latter case as you observe they owe us for the tobacco received in part for i think it a certainty that no money was received from the crown which did not go directly into the hands of mr grand and though he accounts for three millions received before      one of them is the million received of the farmersgeneral an explanation and adjustment of this matter may i make no doubt be easily obtained by writing to mr grand and mr jefferson there can be no error of that magnitude in mr grands accounts for they were rendered to the commissioners from time to time and settled while all the transactions were fresh in memory and i am persuaded the minister will very readily either correct the error in the contract or direct our demanding of the farmers the value of the tobacco as the case may be with great and sincere esteem i have the honor to be sir etc b franklin benjamin franklin    june      philadelphia noah webster mccccxix to noah webster philadelphia    june      sir— i received the letter you did me the honor of writing to me the   th past with the scheme enclosed of your reformed alphabet i think the reformation not only necessary but practicable but have so much to say to you on the subject that i wish to see and confer with you upon it as that   0 would save much time in writing sounds till such an alphabet is fixed not being easily explained or discoursed of clearly upon paper i have formerly considered this matter pretty fully and contrived some of the means of carrying it into execution so as gradually to render the information general our ideas are so nearly similar that i make no doubt of our easily agreeing on the plan and you may depend on the best support i may be able to give it as a part of your institute  of which i wish you would bring with you a complete copy having as yet seen only a part of it i shall then be better able to recommend it as you desire hoping to have soon the pleasure of seeing you i do not enlarge but am with sincere esteem sir etc b franklin benjamin franklin    june      philadelphia m leroy mccccxx to m leroy philadelphia    june      dear friend— my time being much taken up with the business of my present station i can now only write a short letter but in the volume of our transactions which i send you herewith you will find a very long letter which i wrote to you at sea when on my passage hither i enclose some papers relating to your affair with wharton the promise therein made though repeatedly urged by me and     mr vaughan was never fulfilled the father is since striken with palsy and the son is in a worse situation—being as it is said an habitual drunkard in short i believe nothing is to be done with him by fair means and unless you send a power of attorney to sue for your demand or come yourself i am afraid you will never get any thing you are upon the list of persons nominated to be members of our philosophical society and will be chosen undoubtedly at the next fall meeting which perhaps will not be till january next i have given them the german edition of your pieces which you presented to them and have told them that i have some other presents from you which i shall deliver as soon as i can put my things in order so as to find them except that i am too much encumbered with business i find myself happily situated here among my numerous friends placed at the head of my country by its unanimous voice in the bosom of my family my offspring to wait on me and nurse me in a house i built twentythree years since to my mind my malady the stone indeed continues but does not grow worse and human nature is subject to so many more terrible evils that i ought to be content with the share allotted to me i rejoice to hear that the difference between the emperor and your country is accommodated for i love peace you will see in the treaty we have made with prussia some marks of my endeavors to lessen the calamities of future wars present my humble respects and best wishes to your good master if you think they may not be     unacceptable and believe me ever with sincere affection your old true friend and humble servant b franklin if you send a power of attorney let it be to mr samuel vaughan jr benjamin franklin   july      philadelphia jane mecom mccccxxi to mrs jane mecom philadelphia   july      —— you need not be concerned in writing to me about your bad spelling for in my opinion as our alphabet now stands the bad spelling or what is called so is generally the best as conforming to the sound of the letters and of the words to give you an instance a gentleman received a letter in which were these words not finding brown at hom i delivered your meseg to his yf the gentleman finding it bad spelling and therefore not very intelligible called his lady to help him read it between them they picked out the meaning of all but the yf which they could not understand the lady proposed calling her chambermaid because betty says she has the best knack at reading bad spelling of any one i know betty came and was surprised that neither sir nor madam could tell what yf was why says she yf spells wife what else can it spell and indeed it is a much better as well as shorter method of spelling wife than doubleyou i ef e which in reality spell doubleyifey there is much rejoicing in town today it being     the anniversary of the declaration of independence which we signed this day ten years and thereby hazarded lives and fortunes god was pleased to put a favorable end to the contest much sooner than we had reason to expect his name be praised adieu b franklin benjamin franklin   july      philadelphia charles thomson mccccxxii to charles thomson secretary of congress philadelphia   july      sir— this will be delivered to you by scotosh son to the halfking of the wyondot nation who is well recommended as having been always very friendly to our people and who with his suite goes to new york on a visit to congress i make no doubt but the same care will be taken of them that they may be accommodated comfortably while at new york as they have experienced here with great esteem i have the honor to be sir your most obedient and most humble servant b franklin endorsed read    july      referred to secretary at war to report benjamin franklin   july      philadelphia john jay mccccxxiii to john jay philadelphia   july      sir— the enclosed paper will inform you of what has passed here between scotosh a chief of the     wyondot nation and this government on his way to congress he is recommended as having been always very friendly to our people and the council have defrayed the expense of him and his company here and to new york where as col harmar informs he is to visit congress he expresses a strong desire of going to france but as it must cost something considerable to support him thither there and back again we have given him no expectation that the congress will approve of it but if it could be well afforded i should conceive it might be of use to our affairs in that part of the country if after viewing the court and troops and population of france he should return impressed with a high idea of the greatness and power of our ally and thence be able to influence the western indians with opinions proper to defeat the insinuations of the english who are posted on those frontiers with great regards i have the honor to be sir your most obedient and most humble servant b franklin enclosure philadelphia july        scotosh an indian chief of the wyondots and son to the halfking of that nation visited the president accompanied by mons pierre drouillier a french trader of detroit as interpreter who acquainted the president that the chief had a few words to deliver from his father     the chief then taking in his hand three strings of white wampum said brothers i come from my father to speak to you of good and bad affairs good and bad news my father now speaks my brothers i inform you that among my people all is good we have no bad affairs no bad news to relate to you nor have i heard of any bad news from detroit a string near the falls i have heard there are bad affairs but that country is far from mine there are some bad people thereabouts vagabonds from different nations but none of my people are among them a string my brothers i shall be very glad to hear that the measuring the indian country may be delayed for the bad people will i fear take occasion from the measuring to do more mischief perhaps the measurers will be killed and it would give pain to me and my nation to hear such bad news a string the chief then spoke as from himself brothers you have made a good clear road for us to come to you without danger or inconvenience i have found it good and safe having been kindly treated everywhere by your people we will do the same for them when they have occasion to pass through our country brothers     i request you would as soon as possible let me know what you think of the words i brought from my father that i may acquaint him therewith and that mischief to the measurers may be prevented he added that he was going to new york to visit the congress and that he had a curiosity to cross the seas and see france the president replied that he would communicate the words to the council and on wednesday give an answer he had no expectation of so much formality in this visit or he should have requested a meeting of the council to receive it july        scotosh son to the halfking of the wyondots with mr drouillier his interpreter coming again to the presidents house the president spoke to him as follows brother i have communicated to the council the words you delivered to me from your father and we now return the answer i am about to give you to be sent him our brother we are glad to learn from you that there are no bad affairs in your country and that all is well with you we hope it may long so continue a string our brother we know there are some bad people about the falls from whence we sometimes hear of mischief done by them we are glad that none of our     friends the wyondots are among them for they will probably soon suffer for their evil actions a string our brother this state of pennsylvania measures no land but what has been fairly purchased of the six nations the country you speak of is far beyond our limits and the measuring of it under the direction of congress it is therefore with that great council to consider your friendly advice on that subject a string the president then acquainted scotosh that as he was going to new york the council had ordered some money to be given to him for his travelling expenses which was accordingly done and that the charge of their entertainment while here would also be defrayed for which he returned hearty thanks he was at the same time assured that we should endeavor always to keep the road between us as open clear and safe as he had found it benjamin franklin   july      philadelphia noah webster mccccxxiv to noah webster philadelphia   july      sir— i received your favor of the   d past i think with you that the lecturing on the language will be of great use in preparing the minds of people for the improvements proposed and therefore would not advise your omitting any of the engagements you have made for the sake of being here sooner     than your business requires—that is in september or october next i shall then be glad to see and confer with you on the subject being with great esteem sir your humble servant b franklin benjamin franklin    july      philadelphia m grand mccccxxv to mr grand philadelphia    july      sir— i send you enclosed some letters that have passed between the secretary of congress and me respecting three millions of livres acknowledged to have been received before the treaty of february      as don gratuit from the king of which only two millions are found in your accounts unless the million from the farmersgeneral be one of the three i have been assured that all the money received from the king whether as loan or gift went through your hands and as i always looked on the million we had of the farmersgeneral to be distinct from what we had of the crown i wonder how i came to sign the contract acknowledging three millions of gift when in reality there were only two exclusive of that from the farmers and as both you and i examined the project of the contract before i signed it i am surprised that neither of us took notice of the error it is possible that the million furnished ostensibly by the farmers was in fact a gift of the crown in which case as mr thomson observes they owe us for the two shiploads of tobacco which they received     on account of it i most earnestly request of you to get this matter explained that i may stand clear before i die lest some enemy should afterwards accuse me of having received a million not accounted for i am etc b franklin benjamin franklin    july      philadelphia benjamin vaughan mccccxxvi to benjamin vaughan philadelphia    july      dear friend— i recollect that when i had last the pleasure of seeing you at southampton now a twelvemonth since we had some conversation on the bad effects of lead taken inwardly and that at your request i promised to send you in writing a particular account of several facts i then mentioned to you of which you thought some good use might be made i now sit down to fulfil that promise the first thing i remember of this kind was a general discourse in boston when i was a boy of a complaint from north carolina against new england rum that it poisoned their people giving them the dry bellyache with a loss of the use of their limbs the distilleries being examined on the occasion it was found that several of them used leaden stillheads and worms and the physicians were of opinion that the mischief was occasioned by that use of lead the legislature of massachusetts thereupon passed an act prohibiting under severe penalites the use of such stillheads and worms thereafter in      being in london i went to work in the   0 printinghouse of mr palmer bartholomew close as a compositor i there found a practice i had never seen before of drying a case of types which are wet in distribution by placing it sloping before the fire i found this had the additional advantage when the types were not only dried but heated of being comfortable to the hands working over them in cold weather i therefore sometimes heated my case when the types did not want drying but an old workman observing it advised me not to do so telling me i might lose the use of my hands by it as two of our companions had nearly done one of whom that used to earn his guinea a week could not then make more than ten shillings and the other who had the dangles but seven and sixpence this with a kind of obscure pain that i had sometimes felt as it were in the bones of my hand when working over the types made very hot induced me to omit the practice but talking afterwards with mr james a letterfounder in the same close and asking him if his people who worked over the little furnaces of melted metal were not subject to that disorder he made light of any danger from the effluvia but ascribed it to particles of the metal swallowed with their food by slovenly workmen who went to their meals after handling the metal without well washing their fingers so that some of the metalline particles were taken off by their bread and eaten with it this appeared to have some reason in it but the pain i had experienced made me still afraid of those effluvia being in derbyshire at some of the furnaces for     smelting of lead ore i was told that the smoke of those furnaces was pernicious to the neighboring grass and other vegetables but i do not recollect to have heard any thing of the effect of such vegetables eaten by animals it may be well to make the inquiry in america i have often observed that on the roofs of our shingled houses where moss is apt to grow in northern exposures if there be any thing on the roof painted with white lead such as balusters or frames of dormant windows etc there is constantly a streak on the shingles from such paint down to the eaves on which no moss will grow but the wood remains constantly clean and free from it we seldom drink rainwater that falls on our houses and if we did perhaps the small quantity of lead descending from such paint might not be sufficient to produce any sensible ill effect on our bodies but i have been told of a case in europe i forget the place where a whole family was afflicted with what we call the dry bellyache or colica pictorum by drinking rainwater it was at a countryseat which being situated too high to have the advantage of a well was supplied with water from a tank which received the water from the leaded roofs this had been drunk several years without mischief but some young trees planted near the house growing up above the roof and shedding their leaves upon it it was supposed that an acid in those leaves had corroded the lead they covered and furnished the water of that year with its baneful particles and qualities when i was in paris with sir john pringle in          he visited la charité a hospital particularly famous for the cure of that malady and brought from thence a pamphlet containing a list of the names of persons specifying their professions or trades who had been cured there i had the curiosity to examine that list and found that all the patients were of trades that some way or other use or work in lead such as plumbers glaziers painters etc excepting only two kinds stonecutters and soldiers in them i could not reconcile it to my notion that lead was the cause of that disorder but on my mentioning it to a physician of that hospital he informed me that the stonecutters are continually using melted lead to fix the ends of iron balustrades in stone and that the soldiers had been employed by painters as laborers in grinding of colors this my dear friend is all i can at present recollect on the subject you will see by it that the opinion of this mischievous effect from lead is at least above sixty years old and you will observe with concern how long a useful truth may be known and exist before it is generally received and practised on i am ever yours most affectionately b franklin benjamin franklin  0 august      carey mccccxxvii to mr carey  0 august      sir— the memoirs you mention would be of little or no use to your scheme as they contain only some notes of my early life and finish in    0 they     were written to my son and intended only as information to my family i have in hand a full account of my life which i propose to leave behind me in the meantime i wish nothing of the kind may be published and shall be much obliged to the proprietors of the columbian magazine if they will drop that intention for the present with great esteem i am sir your most obedient servant b franklin benjamin franklin    august      philadelphia william cocke mccccxxviii to william cocke philadelphia    august      sir— i received yesterday the letter you did me the honor of writing me on the   th of june past i had never before been acquainted that the name of your intended new state had any relation with my name having understood that it was called frankland it is a very great honor indeed that its inhabitants have done me and i should be happy if it were in my power to show how sensible i am of it by something more essential than my wishes for their prosperity  having resided some years past in europe and being lately arrived thence i have not had an opportunity of being well informed of the points in dispute between you and the state of north carolina i can therefore only say that i think you are perfectly right in resolving to submit them to the discretion of congress and to abide by their determination it is     a wise and impartial tribunal which can have no sinister views to warp its judgment it is happy for us all that we have now in our own country such a council to apply to for composing our differences without being obliged as formerly to carry them across the ocean to be decided at an immense expense by a council which knew little of our affairs would hardly take any pains to understand them and which often treated our applications with contempt and rejected them with injurious language let us therefore cherish and respect our own tribunal for the more generally it is held in high regard the more able it will be to answer effectually the ends of its institution the quieting of our contentions and thereby promoting our common peace and happiness i do not hear any talk of an adjournment of congress concerning which you enquire and i rather think it likely they may continue to sit out their year as it is but lately they have been able to make a quorum for business which must therefore probably be in arrear if you proceed in your intended journey i shall be glad to see you as you pass through philadelphia in the meantime i have the honor to be very respectfully sir your most obedient servant b franklin john coakley lettsom    august      london benjamin franklin mccccxxix from john coakley lettsom london    august      respected friend— not having had the favor of a letter since thy arrival on thy native continent     i take the liberty of addressing a letter with the memoirs of dr fothergill just printed the manner in which i have introduced the memoirs of dr cuming and dr cleghorn will best explain the manner in which i wished to introduce thy respectable name among them i am sensible how inadequate i am to give the true traits of a character that has instructed and astonished both america and europe and it was not my view thus to enter upon the department of an historian but rather by a few anecdotes of early life to lay the basis of a superstructure destined for an abler pen and this i think might be done by correcting the dates and some little particulars of that rough sketch which i formerly sent thee when at paris and this would content me unless thou shouldest be disposed to make any addition i have at different times received from north america various specimens of ores as well as of coal the iron in particular has been very fine and if these various treasures were properly assayed probably in time much national advantage might result there are in your provinces many ingenious persons who with very moderate encouragement would visit your mountains and woods in pursuit of discovery you possess many valuable dyes and articles of medicine yet unknown i have lately had a correspondence with mr humphrey marshall of bradford in west chester county who is an excellent botanist and has a pretty general knowledge of natural history and for a little encouragement would i am informed     undertake a voyage of discovery into your woods and mountains he mentioned to me that such a journey might be undertaken and continued for at least a year at the expense of three hundred pounds if a subscription for this purpose were effected i would willingly subscribe my mite of twenty guineas towards it for the sake of a share of the seeds plants and ores that may be collected i mean as specimens merely of your productions i have now a man from europe travelling through america for the purpose of collecting your productions particularly of the vegetable kind within the last ten years much rhubarb of the turkey kind has been cultivated in scotland and england its cultivation is becoming more and more general i sent seeds over a year ago i have now sent roots as they vegetated with me in pots and i hope it may become an object with you to cultivate this useful plant it is also an ornamental plant in horticulture i hope also by the same opportunity to transmit some tea plants which your southern colonies are well calculated for i am respectfully etc j c lettsom benjamin franklin    august      philadelphia john jay mccccxxx to john jay philadelphia    august      dear sir— i hear a treaty is completed with portugal as soon as it may be made public you     will oblige me much by favoring me with a copy of it the monument of general montgomery may i ask what is become of it it has formerly been said that republics are naturally ungrateful the immediate resolution of congress for erecting that monument contradicts that opinion but the letting the monument lie eight years unpacked if true seems rather a confirmation of it on a review of my affairs since my return i think it proper to make some change in the dispositions of my will having no other copy on this side the water but that in your possession i wish you to send it to me which will much oblige dear sir your most obedient servant b franklin m durival  0 august      versailles m grand mccccxxxi from m durival to mr grand  versailles  0 august      sir— i have received the letter which you did me the honor to write on the   th of this month touching the advance of a million which you say was made by the farmersgeneral to the united states of america the  d of june      i have no knowledge of that advance what i have verified is that the king by the contract of the   th of february      has confirmed the gratuitous gift which his majesty had previously made of the three     millions hereafter mentioned viz one million delivered by the royal treasury the  0th of june      and two other millions advanced also by the royal treasury in      on four receipts of the deputies of congress of the   th of january  d of april  0th of june and   th of october of the same year this explanation will sir i hope resolve your doubt touching the advance of the  d of june      i further recommend to you sir to confer on this subject with m gojard who ought to be better informed than we who had no knowledge of any advances but those made by the royal treasury i have the honor to be etc durival m durival   september      versailles m grand mccccxxxii from m durival to mr grand versailles   september      sir— i laid before the count de vergennes the two letters which you did me the honor to write touching the three millions the free gift of which the king has confirmed in favor of the united states of america the minister sir observed that this gift has nothing to do with the million which the congress may have received from the farmersgeneral in      consequently he thinks that the receipt which you desire may be communicated to you cannot satisfy the object of your view and that it would be useless to give you the copy which you desire i have the honor to be with perfect attachment etc durival     m grand   september      paris m durival mccccxxxiii from mr grand paris   september      my dear sir— the letter you honored me with covered the copies of three letters which mr thomson wrote you in order to obtain an explanation of a million which is not to be found in my accounts i should have been very much embarrassed in satisfying and proving to him that i had not put that million in my pocket had i not applied to m durival who as you will see by the answer enclosed informs me that there was a million paid by the royal treasury on the  0th of june      this is the very million about which mr thomson inquires as i have kept an account of the other two millions which were also furnished by the royal treasury viz the one million in january and april      the other in july and october of the same year as well as that furnished by the farmersgeneral in june      here then are the three millions exactly which were given by the king before the treaty of      and that furnished by the farmersgeneral nothing then remains to be known but who received the first million in june      it could not be myself as i was not charged with the business of congress until january      i therefore requested of m durival a copy of the receipt for the one million you have the answer which he returned to me i have written to him again renewing my request but as the courier is just setting off i cannot wait to give you his answer but you will receive it in my next if i   0 obtain one in the meanwhile i beg you will receive the assurances of the sentiments of respect with which i have the honor to be my dear sir etc grand m durival  0 september      versailles m grand mccccxxxiv from m durival to mr grand versailles  0 september      sir— i have laid before the count de vergennes as you seemed to desire the letter which you did me the honor to write yesterday the minister persists in the opinion that the receipt the copy of which you request has no relation to the business with which you were intrusted on behalf of congress and that this document would be useless in the new point of view in which you have placed it indeed sir it is easy for you to prove that the money in question was not delivered by the royal treasury into your hands as you did not begin to be charged with the business of congress until january      and the receipt for that money is of the  0th of june      i have the honor to be with perfect attachment sir etc durival m grand    september      paris m durival mccccxxxv from mr grand paris    september      sir— i hazard a letter in hopes it may be able to join that of the  th at lorient in order to forward     to you the answer i have just received from m durival you will there see that notwithstanding my entreaty the minister himself refuses to give me a copy of the receipt which i asked for i cannot conceive the reason for this reserve more especially since if there has been a million paid he who has received it has kept the account and it must in time be known i shall hear with pleasure that you have been more fortunate in this respect in america than i have been in france and i repeat to you the assurance of the sentiments of regard with which i have the honor to be etc grand mccccxxxvi on thermometers    september      the two thermometers most generally in use at present among the philosophers of europe are those of réaumur and fahrenheit the french use réaumurs the english fahrenheits in their respective graduations réaumur marked his freezing point 0 fahrenheit fixed his at    of his degrees above 0 and two of his degrees are just equal to one of réaumurs i know that in some instruments this equality is not exact but in two which i have the one réaumurs made by cappy in paris the other fahrenheits by nairne london it is precisely so they hanging together in the same room and those workmen are famed for their exactness     in reading one frequently finds degrees of heat and cold mentioned as measured by one or the other of those thermometers and one is at a loss to reduce that least known to the other rule suppose the degree mentioned is    of réaumur which is    degrees above 0 or its freezing point and you would know to what degree of fahrenheit that answers double the    which will give you  0 of fahrenheits and to them add    his number at the freezing point and you will have    the degree of fahrenheits equal to    of réaumur on the contrary if you would reduce fahrenheit to réaumur first subtract    and then take half of the remainder thus taking    from    there remains  0 and the half of  0 is    this answers in all cases where the degree is above the freezing point if below double the degrees of réaumur and subtract them from the    of fahrenheit which will give you the equivalent degree of his scale thus suppose it   below 0 or the freezing point of réaumur twice   is  0 which deducted from    fahrenheits freezing point gives you    as the equivalent degree of his thermometer and halving the degrees of fahrenheit that are less than    you have the degree of réaumur thus    of fahrenheit being  0 degrees less than    the half of  0 is   the equivalent degree of réaumur     benjamin franklin    september      philadelphia jane mecom mccccxxxvii to mrs jane mecom philadelphia    september      my dear sister— i received your kind letter of the   th past by our cousin williams who besides informs me of your welfare which gives me great pleasure your grandson having finished all the business i had to employ him in set out for boston a few days before cousin williams arrived i suppose he may be with you before this time i had begun to build two good houses next the street instead of three old ones which i pulled down but my neighbor disputing my bounds i have been obliged to postpone till that dispute is settled by law in the meantime the workmen and materials being ready i have ordered an addition to the house i live in it being too small for our growing family there are a good many hands employed and i hope to see it covered in before winter i propose to have in it a long room for my library and instruments with two good bedchambers and two garrets the library is to be even with the floor of my best old chamber and the story under it will for the present be employed only to hold wood but may be made into rooms hereafter this addition is on the side next the river i hardly know how to justify building a library at an age that will so soon oblige me to quit it but we are apt to forget that we are grown old and building is an amusement i think you will do well to instruct your grandson     in the art of making that soap it may be of use to him and t is pity it should be lost some knowing ones here in matters of weather predict a hard winter permit me to have the pleasure of helping to keep you warm lay in a good stock of firewood and draw upon me for the amount your bill shall be paid upon sight by your affectionate brother b franklin benjamin franklin   october      philadelphia m de

language and after all t is very bad french and i therefore write to you in english which i think you will as easily understand if not ma chère amie sophie can interpret it for you some of our letters are long on the way the one you were so kind as to write me the   th of september    did not come to hand till the beginning of june    and lately m le caze tells me that he had a packet from you to me but that he unfortunately left it at lorient and it is not yet arrived if you have made any further experiments in whitening the green vegetable wax i shall be glad to hear what success you have met with i have frequently the pleasure of seeing your valuable son whom i love as my own he has communicated to me his inclination a young lady of this     country and that he has written to you for your and his mothers consent i wish his happiness and i believe he will find it in the choice he has made if you approve of it for the lady bears an excellent character and is of one of the first

highly acceptable both from its intrinsic value and as a pledge of friendly correspondence with the excellent institution over which you preside the formal acknowledgment of such favors is the official duty of our secretaries and they have been directed to return our thanks in the most grateful and respectful terms together with the present of our memoirs the diffusion of the arts and sciences through so many extensive regions     of the globe must afford a subject of contemplation peculiarly satisfactory to your mind as you cannot but feel the delightful consciousness of having been a principal instrument under providence in its accomplishment and i hope that sun which has so long blessed the nations will not set till the interests of truth and knowledge of civil and religious liberty are firmly established in the western hemisphere which it now enlightens your valuable papers on chimneys and on the consumption of smoke have arrived very seasonably to aid a plan which i have in view it is my intention to offer a representation to our magistrates at the ensuing quarter sessions of the expediency and necessity of adopting some measures to purify the air of manchester for they are guardians of the health as well as of the morals of their fellowcitizens and though works which are essential to the prosecution of trade ought not to be deemed nuisances the persons who are engaged in them should be induced or compelled to conduct them in a manner as little injurious as possible to the public this town now contains about fortysix thousand inhabitants and i observe with concern an annual and large increase of pulmonic complaints to the offensive fumes which we breathe i apprehend these distressing and fatal maladies are chiefly to be ascribed the smoke from the velvet dress works is particularly acrimonious and offensive to the lungs and it is so copious even from a single chimney as to scatter a shower of soot over a very considerable space i shall think myself much obliged by the     communication of any hints that your knowledge or experience may suggest on this subject which is interesting not only to manchester but to most other manufacturing towns we have now established here an institution on a plan similar to the late academy at warrington and in conjunction with this a medical school is formed which seems to bid fair for eminent success i will send you our reports when the manchester memoirs are forwarded to you dr and mrs priestley have been here this summer together with dr kippis dr priestley is not in a very good state of health having had a return of the complaint with which he was visited several years ago but his spirits and ardor do not desert him he is at this time zealously engaged in attempts to convert the jews to christianity for this undertaking he believes himself peculiarly well fitted as it is a part of his creed that jesus christ was the actual son of joseph and a lineal descendant of the house of david but the jewish rabbis have declared their resolution to enter into no discussion on these topics being forbidden as they allege by their most sacred laws dr kippis is busied with the life of captain cook which is to be published separately as well as in the biographia britannica our excellent friend dr price is i hear deeply affected with the death of his wife a fresh paralytic stroke carried her off about a month since the doctor is preparing for the press a volume of sermons in support of the arian doctrine and an enlarged edition of his     valuable review of the principal questions and difficulties in morals the college of physicians in london have just printed a specimen of a new pharmacopœia the president has favored me with a copy and i think the dispensatory on the whole is likely to be much improved i have already transmitted in a letter to dr rush my grateful acknowledgments to the american philosophical society for the honor of being elected into their body to you i am doubtless much indebted for this mark of distinction accept my best thanks and believe me to be with the most cordial respect and esteem dear sir etc thomas percival benjamin franklin  0 november      philadelphia m labbé de la roche mccccxl to m labbé de la roche philadelphia  0 november      dear sir— i hope soon to be in a situation when i can write

november      philadelphia william hunter mccccxli to william hunter philadelphia    november      my dear old friend— it rejoiced me to learn by your kind letter of february last which i received about ten days since that you are still in the land of the living and that you are still at bath the very place that i think gives you the best chance of passing the evening of life agreeably i too am got into my niche after being kept out of it twentyfour years by foreign employments it is a very good house that i built so long ago to retire into without being able till now to enjoy it i am again surrounded by my friends with a fine family of grandchildren about my knees and an affectionate good daughter and soninlaw to take care of me and after fifty years public service i have the pleasure to find the esteem of my country with regard to me undiminished the late reëlection of me to the presidentship notwithstanding the different parties we are split into being absolutely unanimous this i tell you not merely to indulge in my own vanity but because i know you love me and will be pleased to hear of whatever happens that is agreeable to your friend i find mr anstey  whom you recommend to me a very agreeable sensible man and shall render him any service that may lie in my power i thank you for the new bath guide i had read it formerly but it has afforded me fresh pleasure your newspapers to please honest john bull   0 paint our situation here in frightful colors as if we were very miserable since we broke our connection with him but i will give you some remarks by which you may form your own judgment our husbandmen who are the bulk of the nation have had plentiful crops their produce sells at high prices and for ready hard money wheat for instance at eight shillings and eight shillings and sixpence a bushel our working people are all employed and get high wages are well fed and well clad our estates in houses are trebled in value by the rising of rents since the revolution buildings in philadelphia increase amazingly besides small towns rising in every quarter of the country the laws govern justice is well administered and property as secure as in any country on the globe our wilderness lands are daily buying up by new settlers and our settlements extend rapidly to the westward european goods were never so cheaply afforded us as since britain has no longer the monopoly of supplying us in short all among us may be happy who have happy dispositions such being necessary to happiness even in paradise i speak these things of pennsylvania with which i am most acquainted as to the other states when i read in all the papers of the extravagant rejoicings every  th of july the day on which was signed the declaration of independence i am convinced that none of them are discontented with the revolution adieu my dear friend and believe me ever with sincere esteem and affection yours most truly b franklin     benjamin franklin    november      philadelphia

sides with great esteem and affection i am ever yours b franklin benjamin franklin    december      philadelphia mccccxliv to the captain of a spanish manofwar philadelphia    december      honorable sir— the council having received information that the ship under your command lies in a dangerous situation exposed to be much injured if not destroyed by the violence of the driving ice have thought that not only the duty of hospitality of duty towards strangers in our port but the just regard due from us to the excellent prince your sovereign and the good friend of these states required of us to afford every assistance in our power for her preservation and apprehending that possibly your people accustomed to warmer climates may not be so well acquainted with the force and mischievous effects of ice and the methods of guarding against it we send to you two of the wardens of the port men of experience and knowledge in such matters on whose advice you may rely and who have authority to obtain such aid from the inhabitants if any should be wanted as may enable them to put her in a position of the greatest possible safety wishing you every kind of prosperity i have the honor to be honorable sir your most obedient and most humble servant b franklin     benjamin franklin    december      philadelphia nathaniel falconer mccccxlv to nathaniel falconer esq etc philadelphia    december      gentlemen— when you arrive at marcus hook you will deliver the letter to the captain of the spanish manofwar and having viewed the situation of the ship and the piers you will respectfully offer him your opinion and advice on the best means of securing her from damage by the driving ice in writing if he desires it and afford every assistance you can procure for the expense of which if he does not pay it you will be indemnified here if you find the piers likely to be damaged in case of his refusal to follow your counsel you will likewise represent that to him in writing to be made use of hereafter in support of a complaint to his court and demand of satisfaction if such a step should be thought proper and you will take such prudent steps as shall occur to you for preventing as far as possible or lessening such damage you will also enquire into the truth of the reports of injuries done by his people to the inhabitants and if you find them true acquaint him with them expressing at the same time your persuasion that he will take measures to prevent such injuries for the future with sincere regard i am gentlemen your humble servant b franklin     m de saussure    december      geneva benjamin franklin mccccxlvi from m de saussure geneva    december      sir— i have taken the liberty of requesting messrs van neck  co of london to forward to you in america the second volume of my voyages dans les alpes i am very desirous that this work should be found worthy of your approbation or at least that you should not think it was hardly worth sending so far although there are few branches of human knowledge with which you are unacquainted and in which you have not given proofs of your genius you have appeared to take an especial interest in natural philosophy and particularly electricity and meteorology in this volume you will find chapters of considerable length on these two subjects the structure of mountains was particularly the object of my research in these travels but at the same time i thought i ought to take the opportunity of studying the constitution of the atmosphere at heights which are seldom reached and for this purpose i invented a very convenient and sensitive electrometer which you will find described in the volume and with which i made some curious experiments upon the electricity of the air in clear weather i found this electricity stronger in proportion as the place of observation was higher and more insulated i am very desirous to try the same experiment on the summit of mount blanc which is as you know the highest mountain of the old     continent i almost despaired of being able to reach it when i finished the volume which i now have the honor to send you will there see an account of my fruitless attempts since then however i have obtained information which gives me an almost certain prospect of doing it at least if i am alive and in good health next june six peasants from chamouni made the attempt at the beginning of last summer and went to a great height though they did not reach the summit one of them who got lost while looking after crystals was obliged to pass the night in the snows at a very elevated point a terrible hailstorm came on and his companions gave him up for lost he suffered but little however the next morning the weather was extremely fine and as it was very early he had time to examine carefully the different approaches to the summit and to fix upon the proper path to reach it on his return to chamouni he said nothing to his companions but he communicated his views to a young physician named paccard who had also several times attempted without success to scale the mountain they went and slept on the top of the rocks at the entrance of the snows and starting again at break of day on the following morning being the  th of august they reached the summit between six and seven in the evening they were seen there with spyglasses from chamouni the baron de garsdorf even followed them with a good telescope and marked out their path they returned the same day or rather night with excessive fatigue and danger their faces burnt swollen and even     bleeding and they were almost blind from the reflection from the snow in fact they had taken no precautions whatever  as soon as i learned the success of their enterprise i sent a number of peasants to build me a place of shelter among the snows near some insulated rocks which are halfway up the snowy part of the mountain my intention was to go and sleep there and thus to divide the terrible days work which my predecessors had been obliged to encounter i went to chamouni and slept as they had done at the entrance of the snows but there came on in the night a furious storm and much snow which rendered the mountain inaccessible for the rest of the season but my hut is still standing and i hope to accomplish my project next summer i shall need your ingenuity when in that situation to make my observations as useful as they should be  i am with the most perfect esteem sir etc de saussure benjamin franklin thomas paine mccccxlvii to thomas paine  date uncertain dear sir— i have read your manuscript with some attention by the argument it contains against     a particular providence though you allow a general providence you strike at the foundations of all religion for without the belief of a providence that takes cognizance of guards and guides and may favor particular persons there is no motive to worship a deity to fear his displeasure or to pray for his protection i will not enter into any discussion of your principles though you seem to desire it at present i shall only give you my opinion that though your reasons are subtile and may prevail with some readers you will not succeed so as to change the general sentiments of mankind on that subject and the consequence of printing this piece will be a great deal of odium drawn upon yourself mischief to you and no benefit to others he that spits against the wind spits in his own face but were you to succeed do you imagine any good would be done by it you yourself may find it easy to live a virtuous life without the assistance afforded by religion you having a clear perception of the advantages of virtue and the disadvantages of vice and possessing a strength of resolution sufficient to enable you to resist common temptations but think how great a portion of mankind consists of weak and ignorant men and women and of inexperienced inconsiderate youth of both sexes who have need of the motives of religion to restrain them from vice to support their virtue and retain them in the practice of it till it becomes habitual which     is the great point for its security and perhaps you are indebted to her originally that is to your religious education for the habits of virtue upon which you now justly value yourself you might easily display your excellent talents of reasoning upon a less hazardous subject and thereby obtain a rank with our most distinguished authors for among us it is not necessary as among the hottentots that a youth to be raised into the company of men should prove his manhood by beating his mother i would advise you therefore not to attempt unchaining the tiger but to burn this piece before it is seen by any other person whereby you will save yourself a great deal of mortification by the enemies it may raise against you and perhaps a good deal of regret and repentance if men are so wicked with religion what would they be if without it i intend this letter itself as a proof of my friendship and therefore add no professions to it but subscribe simply yours b franklin john adams    january      grosvenor square benjamin franklin mccccxlviii from john adams grosvenor square    january      sir— dr white has been so obliging to me as to take with him to america two volumes one for your excellency and one for the philosophical society of philadelphia of a production of mine suggested by the late popular frenzy in massachusetts and new hampshire it contains my confession of political     faith and if it is heresy i shall i suppose be cast out of communion but it is the only sense in which i am or ever was a republican and in such times i hold concealment of sentiments to be no better than countenancing sedition let me beg your excellencys acceptance of one volume and that you would present the other to the philosophical society with my respectful thanks for the volume of their transactions transmitted to me by your excellency in their name that work is in good reputation here mr dilly has often requested me to mention to your excellency his great desire of publishing a new edition of your works and a sketch of your life and his inclination is much quickened since he learned that you had been advised to write it with your own hand enclosed is a note which i received from him this morning mr dilly is as honest a man as any of the trade here and as much esteemed by men of letters so that i believe you may depend upon his honor and skill my regards to mr franklin and mr bache if you please with great respect i have the honor to be sir etc john adams benjamin franklin    january      philadelphia charles thomson mccccxlix to charles thomson secretary of congress philadelphia    january      dear friend— you may remember that in the correspondence between us in june last on the subject of a million free gift of the king of france acknowledged in our contract to have been received  00 but which did not appear to be accounted for in our bankers account unless it should be the same with the million said to be received from the farmersgeneral i mentioned that an explanation might doubtless be easily obtained by writing to mr grand or mr jefferson i know not whether you have accordingly written to either of them but being desirous that the matter should speedily be cleared up i wrote myself to mr grand a letter upon it of which i now enclose a copy with his answers and several letters from m durival who is chef du bureau des fonds and has under his care the finance des affaires etrangères you will see by these letters that the million in question was delivered to somebody on the  0th of june      but it does not appear to whom it is clear however that it could not be to mr grand nor to the commissioners from congress for we did not meet in france till the end of december      or beginning of january      and that banker was not charged before with our affairs by the ministers reserve in refusing him a copy of the receipt  i conjecture it must be money advanced  0  for our use to m de beaumarchais and that it is a mystère du cabinet which perhaps should not be further enquired into unless necessary to guard against more demands than may be just from that agent for it may well be supposed that if the court furnished him with the means of supplying us they may not be willing to furnish authentic proofs of such a transaction so early in our dispute with britain pray tell me has he dropped his demands or does he still continue to worry you with them i should like to have these original letters returned to me but you may if you please keep copies of them it is true the million in question makes no difference in your accounts with the king of france it not being mentioned or charged as so much lent and to be repaid but stated as freely given yet if it was put into the hands of any of your agents or ministers they ought certainly to account for it i do not recollect whether mr deane had arrived in france before the  0th of june       but from his great want of money when i joined him a few months after i hardly think it could have been paid to him possibly mr jefferson may obtain the information though mr grand could not and i wish he may be directed to make the enquiry as i know he would do it directly i mean if by hortalez  cos further demands or for any other reason such an enquiry should be thought necessary i am etc b franklin  0  benjamin franklin    february      philadelphia alexander small mccccl to alexander small philadelphia    february      dear friend— i received your favor of june last and thank you for the kind congratulations contained in it what you have heard of my malady is true—that it does not grow worse thanks be to god i still enjoy pleasure in the society of my friends and books and much more in the prosperity of my country concerning which your people are continually deceiving themselves i am glad the improvement of the book of common prayer has met with your approbation and that of good mrs baldwin it is not yet that i know of received in public practice anywhere but as it is said that good motions never die perhaps in time it may be found useful i read with pleasure the account you gave of the flourishing state of your commerce and manufactures and of the plenty you have of resources to carry the nation through all its difficulties you have one of the finest countries in the world and if you can be cured of the folly of making war for trade in which wars more has been always expended than the profits of any trade can compensate you may make it one of the happiest make the best of your own natural advantages instead of endeavoring to diminish those of other nations and there is no doubt but that you may yet prosper and flourish your beginning to consider france no longer as a natural enemy is a mark of progress in the good sense of the nation of  0  which posterity will find the benefit in the rarity of wars the diminution of taxes and increase of riches as to the refugees whom you think we were so impolitic in rejecting i do not find that they are missed here or that anybody regrets their absence and certainly they must be happier where they are under the government they admire and be better received among a people whose cause they espoused and fought for than among those who cannot so soon have forgotten the destruction of their habitations and the spilt blood of their dearest friends and near relations i often think with great pleasure on the happy days i passed in england with my and your learned and ingenious friends who have left us to join the majority in the world of spirits every one of them now knows more than all of us they have left behind it is to me a comfortable reflection that since we must live for ever in a future state there is a sufficient stock of amusement in reserve for us to be found in constantly learning something new to eternity the present quantity of human ignorance infinitely exceeding that of human knowledge adieu my dear friend and believe me in whatever world yours most affectionately b franklin in his eightysecond year benjamin franklin    march      philadelphia nevil maskelyne mccccli to nevil maskelyne philadelphia    march      reverend and dear sir— the writer of the enclosed paper concerning the variation of the compass  0  and the important use which he supposes may be made of that variation not being satisfied with the judgment of some of our principal mathematicians here has earnestly desired me to communicate it to some of my learned friends in europe  i know no one better acquainted with the subject than yourself and as i cannot refuse complying with his request i beg you will excuse my giving you this trouble and favor me with a line expressing your opinion which condescension will very much oblige sir your most obedient servant b franklin john sevier   april      state of franklin mount pleasant benjamin franklin mcccclii from john sevier state of franklin mount pleasant   april      sir— permit me to introduce to your excellency the subject of our new disputed government in the year      in the month of june the legislature of north carolina ceded to congress all their claims to the lands west of the appalachian mountains on conditions i make no doubt you are acquainted with as the act was shortly after laid before congress the inhabitants of this country well knowing that the congress of the united states would accept the cession and having no idea that north carolina  0  would attempt repealing the act formed themselves into a separate and independent state by the name of franklin in november following north carolina repealed this act of cession in may      congress took the several acts under their consideration and entered into resolves respecting the same the purport of which i presume you are acquainted with the government of franklin was carried on unmolested by north carolina until november      when that legislature passed an act allowing the people in some of our counties to hold elections under certain regulations unknown to any former law whereby a few from disaffection and disappointment might have it in their power to elect persons who were to be considered the legal delegation of the people this was done and countenanced and at their last session in november      they have undertaken to resume their jurisdiction and sovereignty over the state of franklin notwithstanding the whole of their adherents do not exceed two or three hundred against a majority of at least seven thousand effective militia they have contrary to the interest of the people in two of the counties to wit washington and sullivan by their acts removed the former places of holding courts to certain places convenient to the disaffected as we conceive in order that they might have a pretext to prevaricate upon i have thus given your excellency the outlines of our past and present situation and beg leave to inform you that from your known patriotic and benevolent disposition as also your great experience  0  and wisdom i am by and with the advice of our council of state induced to make this application that should you from this simple statement of the several occurrences think our cause so laudable as to give us your approbation you would be pleased to condescend to write on the subject and any advice instruction or encouragement you may think we shall deserve will be acknowledged in the most grateful manner we have been informed that your excellency some time since did us the honor to write to us on the subject of our state if so unfortunately for us the letters have miscarried and are not come to hand many safe conveyances might be had a letter may be sent by the bearer captain john woods if he should return by the way of franklin or if it were directed to the care of the governor of georgia it would come safe and perhaps by a number of people who travel to this country i have the honor to be sir etc john sevier benjamin franklin    april      philadelphia m le veillard mccccliii to m le veillard philadelphia    april      i have received a number of letters from you which gave me great pleasure though i have not regularly answered when you shall consider the situation of a man who had been many years absent from home the multiplicity of private affairs he  0  must consequently have to settle the public business of a great government to be attended to and this under the frequent teasing of a painful disease you will probably make some charitable allowance for his delay in writing to his friends and not charge it all as the effect of forgetfulness and want of affection i now have all your letters of the last year before me and shall go through them in order that of march   th announced a m de la villele nephew of the late madame de la frété as intending a voyage hither but he has not yet appeared in these parts if he arrives while i live he will be paid every attention and civility in my power to show him i thank you for the trouble you have taken in selling my forte piano and dividing the money as i desired the lodge of the nine sisters have done me too much honor in proposing the prize you mention as to the little history i promised you my purpose still continues of completing it and i hoped to do it this summer having built an addition to my house in which i have placed my library and where i can write without being disturbed by the noise of the children but the general assembly having lately desired my assistance in a great convention to be held here in may next for amending the federal constitution i begin to doubt whether i can make any progress in it till that business is over yours of the   d of may did not arrive here till the  th of october and this is not the only instance of the long time letters are delayed in your seaports  0  it is true that we had as you mention two parties in this state—one for preserving the constitution as it is and the other for adding an upper house as a check to the assembly but having tried it seven years the strongest party was for continuing it and since my arrival no obstruction has happened in public business such as you had been informed of by the seceding of one party from the assembly having served one year as president of council i had not resolution enough to refuse serving another and was again chosen in november last without a single dissenting voice but my own by our laws one cannot serve more than three years but i think i shall decline the third i am quite of your opinion that our independence is not quite complete till we have discharged our public debt this state is not behindhand in its proportion and those who are in arrear are actually employed in contriving means to discharge their respective balances but they are not all equally diligent in business nor equally successful the whole will however be paid i am persuaded in a few years the english have not yet delivered up the posts on our frontiers agreeable to treaty the pretence is that our merchants have not paid their debts i was a little provoked when i first heard this and i wrote some remarks upon it which i send you they have been written near a year but i have not yet published them being unwilling to encourage any of our people who may be able to pay in their neglect of that duty this paper therefore is only for your  0  amusement and that of our excellent friend the duke de rochefoucauld  you blame me for writing three pamphlets and neglecting to write the little history you should consider they were written at sea out of my own head the other could not so well be written there for want of the documents that could only be had here as to my malady concerning which you so kindly enquire i have never had the least doubt of its being the stone i am sensible that it is grown heavier but on the whole it does not give me more pain than when at passy and except in standing walking or making water i am very little incommoded by it sitting or lying in bed i am generally quite easy god be thanked and as i live temperately drink no wine and use daily the exercise of the dumbbell i flatter myself that the stone is kept from augmenting so much as it might otherwise do and that i may still continue to find it tolerable people who live long who will drink of the cup of life to the very bottom must expect to meet with some of the usual dregs and when i reflect on the number of terrible maladies human nature is subject to i think myself favored in having to my share only the stone and the gout in yours of august   st you mention your having written the   st and   th of june which letters were in a paquet with one from the duke de rochefoucauld two from m and mad brillon etc i have   0 not been so happy as to receive these letters they never came to hand you were right in conjecturing that i wrote the remarks on the thoughts concerning executive justice i have no copy of those remarks at hand and forget how the saying was introduced that it was better one thousand guilty persons should escape than one innocent suffer your criticisms thereon appear to be just and i imagine you may have misapprehended my intention in mentioning it i always thought with you that the prejudice in europe which supposes a family dishonored by the punishment of one of its members was very absurd it being on the contrary my opinion that a rogue hanged out of a family does it more honor than ten that live in it what you mention of our paper money if you mean that of this state pennsylvania is not well understood it was made before my arrival and not being a legal tender can do no injustice to anybody nor does any one here complain of it though many are justly averse to an increase of the quantity at this time there being a great deal of real money in the country and one bank in good credit i have myself purchased ten actions in it which at least shows my good opinion of it besides the addition to my house mentioned above i have been building two new houses on my front next the street they are of brick and each twentyfour feet wide by fortyfive deep and three stories high the affairs in dealing with so many workmen and furnishers of materials such as bricklayers     carpenters stonecutters painters glaziers limeburners timbermerchants coppersmiths carters laborers etc etc have added not a little to the fatiguing business i have gone through in the last year as mentioned above and strengthen in some degree my apology for being so bad a correspondent mr brabanzon has requested me to send him some seeds in time to plant this spring but his letter came to hand too late they will be got the ensuing autumn and sent so as to be ready for planting next year temple and benjamin will write to you this letter goes by mr paine one of our principal writers at the revolution being the author of common sense a pamphlet that had prodigious effects he does not speak french or i should recommend him to your civilities as i do to those of our friend the good duke the last letter i have had the pleasure of receiving from you is that of nov         i cannot give you a better idea of my present happiness in my family than in telling you that my daughter has all the virtues of a certain good lady that you allow me to love the same tender affections and intentions ingenuity industry economy etc etc etc embrace that good dame for me very warmly and the amiable daughter my best wishes attend the whole family whom i shall never cease to love while i am b franklin     benjamin franklin    april      philadelphia duke de la rochefoucauld mccccliv to the duke de la rochefoucauld philadelphia    april      i have been happy in receiving three very kind letters from my greatly respected and esteemed friend since my being in america they are dated november  0      february        and january         in mine of this date to m le veillard i have made the best apology i could for my being so bad a correspondent i will not trouble you with a repetition of it as i know you often see him i will only confess my fault and trust to your candor and goodness for my pardon your friendly congratulations on my arrival and reception here were very obliging the latter was as you have heard extremely flattering the two parties in the assembly and council the constitutionists and anticonstitutionists joined in requesting my service as counsellor and afterwards in electing me as president of seventyfour members in council and assembly who voted by ballot there was in my first election but one negative besides my own and in the second after a years service only my own and i experience from all the principal people in the government every attention and assistance that can be desired towards making the task as little burdensome to me as possible so i am going on very comfortably hitherto with my second year and i do not at present see any likelihood of a change but future events are always uncertain being governed by providence or subject to chances and popular favor is     very precarious being sometimes lost as well as gained by good actions so i do not depend on a continuance of my present happiness and therefore shall not be surprised if before my time of service expires something should happen to diminish it these states in general enjoy peace and plenty there have been some disorders in the massachusetts and rhode island governments those in the former are quelled for the present those in the latter being contention for and against paper money will probably continue some time maryland too is divided on the same subject the assembly being for it and the senate against it each is now employed in endeavoring to gain the people to its party against the next election and it is probable the assembly may prevail paper money in moderate quantities has been found beneficial when more than occasions of commerce require it depreciated and was mischievous and the populace are apt to demand more than is necessary in this state we have some and it is useful and i do not hear any clamor for more there seems to be but little thought at present in the particular states of mending their particular constitutions but the grand federal constitution  is generally blamed as not having given sufficient powers to congress the federal head a convention is therefore appointed to revise that constitution and propose a better you will see by the enclosed paper that your friend is to be one in that business though he doubts his malady may not permit his giving constant attendance i am glad to see that you are     named as one of a general assembly to be convened in france i flatter myself that great good may accrue to that dear nation from the deliberations of such an assembly i pray god to give it his blessing i sympathize with you and the family most sincerely in the great loss sustained by the decease of that excellent woman  it must be indeed a heavy one my best wishes attend those that remain and that the happiness of your sweet domestic society may long continue without such another interruption i send herewith a volume of the transactions of our philosophical society for you another for m de condorcet and a third for the academy the war had interrupted our attempts to improve ourselves in scientific matters but we now begin to resume them the bearer of this is mr paine the author of a famous piece entitled common sense published here with great effect on the minds of the people at the beginning of the revolution he is an ingenious honest man and as such i beg leave to recommend him to your civilities he carries with him the model of a bridge of a new construction his own invention concerning which i intended to have recommended him to m peyronet but i hear he is no more you can easily procure mr paine a sight of the models and drawings of the collection appertaining to the ponts et chaussées they must afford him useful lights on the subject we want a bridge over our river schuylkill and have no artist here regularly bred to that kind of architecture     my grandsons are very sensible of the honor of your remembrance and desire me to present their respects with the most sincere and perfect esteem and attachment i am ever my dear friend etc b franklin benjamin franklin    april      philadelphia count destaing mcccclv to the count destaing philadelphia    april      dear sir— when i received the two letters you did me the honor of writing to me last year i was made to hope for the great pleasure of soon receiving you here in your way to georgia that event would have made me very happy i should have had an opportunity of showing some marks of the respect i bear and always shall for the generous warrior who fought and bled in the cause of liberty and my country the assembly of that state has granted me  000 acres of their land to be located where i can find any vacant i wish much that it might be near yours for you contrived to make your neighborhood so agreeable to me at passy that i could wish to be your neighbor everywhere m duplessis  stayed here but a few days i should have been glad of any occasion of being serviceable to him on your account the bearer of this is mr paine author of the celebrated pamphlet common sense by which the revolution was greatly forwarded he must be known to     you by reputation will you permit me to recommend him as a friend of mine to those civilities you have so much pleasure in showing to strangers of merit with sincere and great esteem and respect i am ever dear sir etc b franklin benjamin franklin    april      philadelphia marquis de chastellux mcccclvi to the marquis de chastellux philadelphia    april      dear sir— your most pleasing letter accompanied by the invaluable present of your journal  and translation of colonel humphreys poem came to hand but lately though dated in june last i believe they have been in the west indies they have given me a great deal of pleasure in the perusal as every thing of yours always did the portrait you have made of our country and people is what in painting is called a handsome likeness for which we are much obliged to you we shall be the better for it if we endeavor to merit what you kindly say in our favor and to correct what you justly censure i am told the journal is translated into english and printed in one of the states i know not which not having seen the translation the newspapers tell us that you are about to have an assembly of notables to consult on improvements of your government it is somewhat singular     that we should be engaged in the same project here at the same time but so it is and a convention for the purpose of revising and amending our federal constitution is to meet at this place next month i hope both assemblies will be blessed with success and that their deliberations and counsels may promote the happiness of both nations in the state of pennsylvania government notwithstanding our parties goes on at present very smoothly so that i have much less trouble in my station than was expected massachusetts has lately been disturbed by some disorderly people but they are now quelled the rest of the states go on pretty well except some dissensions in rhode island and maryland respecting paper money mr paine whom you know and who undertakes to deliver this letter to you can give you full information of our affairs and therefore i need not enlarge upon them i beg leave to recommend him to your civilities i have fulfilled all your commissions to the ladies here who are much flattered by your kind remembrance of them my family join in every sentiment of esteem and respect with my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin benjamin franklin    april      philadelphia abbés chalet abbés arnaud mcccclvii to the abbés chalet and arnaud philadelphia    april      dear friends— your reflections on our situation compared with that of many nations of europe     are very sensible and just let me add that only a virtuous people are capable of freedom as nations become corrupt and vicious they have more need of masters our public affairs go on as well as can reasonably be expected after so great an overturning we have had some disorders in different parts of the country but we arrange them as they arise and are daily mending and improving so that i have no doubt but all will come right in time yours b franklin benjamin franklin    april      philadelphia marquis de lafayette mcccclviii to the marquis de lafayette philadelphia    april      dear friend— i received the kind letter you did me the honor of writing in february      the indolence of old age and the perpetual teasing of too much business have made me so bad a correspondent that i have hardly written a letter to any friend in europe during the last twelvemonth but as i have always a pleasure in hearing from them which i cannot expect will be continued if i do not write to them i again take up my pen and begin with those whose correspondence is of the greatest value among which i reckon that of the marquis de lafayette i was glad to hear of your safe return to paris after so long and fatiguing a journey that is the place where your enlightened zeal for the welfare of     our country can employ itself most to our advantage and i know it is always at work and indefatigable our enemies are as you observe very industrious in depreciating our national character their abuse sometimes provokes me and i am almost ready to retaliate but i have held my hand though there is abundant room for recrimination because i would do nothing that might hasten another quarrel by exasperating those who are still sore from their late disgraces perhaps it may be best that they should please themselves with fancying us weak and poor and divided and friendless they may then not be jealous of our growing strength which since the peace does really make rapid progress and may be less intent on interrupting it i do not wonder that the germans who know little of free constitutions should be ready to suppose that such cannot support themselves we think they may and we hope to prove it that there should be faults in our first sketches or plans of government is not surprising rather considering the times and the circumstances under which they were formed it is surprising that the faults are so few those in the general confederating articles are now about to be considered in a convention called for that express purpose these will indeed be the most difficult to rectify those of particular states will undoubtedly be rectified as their inconveniences shall by experience be made manifest and whatever difference of sentiment there may be among us respecting particular regulations the enthusiastic rejoicings with which the day of declared independence is annually celebrated   0 demonstrate the universal satisfaction of the people with the revolution and its grand principles i enclose the vocabulary you sent me with the words of the shawanese and delaware languages which colonel harmar has procured for me he is promised one more complete which i shall send you as soon as it comes to my hand my grandson whom you so kindly inquire after is at his estate in the jerseys and amuses himself with cultivating his lands i wish he would seriously make a business of it and renounce all thoughts of public employment for i think agriculture the most honorable because the most independent of all professions but i believe he hankers a little after paris or some other of the polished cities of europe thinking the society there preferable to what he meets with in the woods of ancocas as it certainly is if he was now here he would undoubtedly join with me and the rest of my family who are much flattered by your remembrance of them in best wishes for your health and prosperity and that of your whole amiable fireside you will allow an old friend of fourscore to say he loves your wife when he adds and children and prays god to bless them all adieu and believe me ever yours most affectionately b franklin benjamin franklin    april      philadelphia m le roy mcccclix to m le roy philadelphia    april      my dear old friend— i believe i have not written to you since i received your kind letter of     july    and october        such has been my continual occupation in public and private business having the building of three houses upon my hands that i had no time left for philosophical correspondence i now take up my pen with the honest resolution of paying off some of my debts you mention that m de buffon avoit des douleurs semblables aux miennes i sympathize with him let me know in your next how he does i do not understand these dispensations of providence though probably they are for the best but it seems to me that if you or i had the disposition of good and evil in this world so excellent a man would not have an hours pain during his existence your account of the progress made in the art of ballooning by the acquisition of a tight enveloppe and the means of descending and rising without throwing out ballast or letting out air is very pleasing i am sorry the artists at javelle do not continue their experiments i always thought they were in the likeliest way of making improvements as they were remote from interruption in their experiments i have sometimes wished i had brought with me from france a balloon sufficiently large to raise me from the ground in my malady it would have been the most easy carriage for me being led by a string held by a man walking on the ground i should be glad to have mr meuniers work pray let mr grand know where he may buy it for me it gives me pleasure to hear of the success attending the conductors at brest and at dijon time will     bring them more into use and of course make them more useful it is a curious fact that of the death of so many pigeons by lightning without disturbing their position pray when you see m de malesherbes present to him my respects he is one of the most respectable characters of this age believe me ever my dear friend with the sincerest esteem and respect yours most affectionately b franklin benjamin franklin    april      philadelphia thomas jefferson mcccclx to thomas jefferson philadelphia    april      dear sir— i have lately received your favor of dec   d the diplomas i hope are got to hand before this time i am much obliged by your taking care of my encyclopedie mr hopkinson will account with you for it i am glad to learn that every thing is quiet in europe and like to continue so i hope the same will be the case here though bontdefeus are not wanting among us who by inflammatory writings in the papers are perpetually endeavoring to set us together by the ears about taxes and certificates etc the insurgents in the massachusetts are quelled and i believe a great majority of that people approve the measure of government in reducing them yet i see that in the late election they have left out the late governor and chosen mr hancock     but he was always more popular than mr bowdoin had resigned on account of his infirmities and his health being mended his friends have taken advantage of the offence given by mr bowdoin to the malcontents to increase the number of votes against him his refusing the bill for reducing the governors salary has also i imagine hurt his interest at this election so that upon the whole i do not think his not being chosen any proof of general dissatisfaction with the measures taken to suppress the rebellion or with the constitution our federal constitution is generally thought defective and a convention first proposed by virginia and since recommended by congress is to assemble here next month to revise it and propose amendments the delegates generally appointed as far as i have heard of them are men of character for prudence and ability so that i hope good from their meeting indeed if it does not do good it must do harm as it will show that we have not wisdom enough among us to govern ourselves and will strengthen the opinion of some political writers that popular governments cannot long support themselves i am sorry for the death of m peyronet on account of mr paine who would have been pleased and instructed by conferring with that ingenious and skilful artist on the subject of his bridge and it was my intention to introduce him to m peyronets acquaintance i have requested the duke de rochefoucauld to procure him a sight of the models and drafts in the repository of the ponts et chaussées     you are well acquainted with mr paines merit and need no request of mine to serve him in his views and introduce him where it may be proper and of advantage to him with great and sincere esteem i have the honor to be your excellencys most obedient and most humble servant b franklin benjamin franklin    april      philadelphia m grand mcccclxi to mr grand philadelphia    april      my dear friend— i received in its time your favor of september  th and approve of your reason for not adding the      livres to the credit of my account what related to the million was also very satisfactory yours of dec   th and feb  th are just come to hand together with my account for the year      which appears to be right i observe you have sold all my actions in the caisse descompte and though i have no longer any concern in that fund i rejoice to hear of its prosperity the classics and other books are not come to hand but mr jefferson will take care to send them those you sent by mr franks are received your mention of the malady of m de vergennes afflicted me and much more the news i since hear of his death so wise and so good a man taken away from the station he filled is a great loss not only to     france but to europe in general to america and to mankind not having found the cares of government so burthensome as i apprehended i consented to serve a second year and was chosen unanimously by the junction of all parties so that there was but one negative voice viz my own and that given as you may suppose for modestys sake the three houses which i began to build last year are nearly finished and i am now about to begin two others building is an old mans amusement the advantage is for his posterity since my coming home the market is extended before my ground next the street and the high rents such a situation must afford has been one of my inducements as often as my draft may be presented to you exceeding my cash in your hands i hereby desire you will furnish yourself by immediately disposing of some of my stock in the public funds for the best room in the addition i have made to my dwellinghouse i want a mirror      french inches long and    inches wide and i request you will send me such an one as the pacquet boat is henceforth to sail from havre it will be easier to have things from paris than formerly no frame is to be with it as it is to be fixed over the chimney i continue thanks to god in good health please to remember me kindly to all my old acquaintance who do me the honor to inquire after me my grandsons and the rest of my family join me in best wishes of health and happiness to you and yours     and i am ever with great and sincere esteem my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin p s—i have desired madame helvetius to execute a little commission for my daughter if she does it i request you would pay the bills benjamin franklin    april      philadelphia abbé morellet mcccclxii to the abbé morellet philadelphia    april      my very dear friend— i received though long after they were written your very agreeable favors of october  0      and february         with the pieces enclosed productions of the auteuil  academy of belles lettres your kind and friendly wishes and congratulations are extremely obliging it gives me an infinite pleasure to find that i still retain a favorable place in the remembrance of the worthy and the good whose delightful and instructive society i had the happiness of enjoying while i resided in france but though i could not leave that dear nation without regret i certainly did right in coming home i am here in my niche in my own house in the bosom of my family my daughter and grandchildren all about me among my old friends or the sons of my friends who equally respect me and who all     speak and understand the same language with me and you know that if a man desires to be useful by the exercise of his mental faculties he loses half their force when in a foreign country where he can only express himself in a language with which he is not well acquainted in short i enjoy here every opportunity of doing good and every thing else i could wish for except repose and that i may soon expect either by the cessation of my office which cannot last more than three years or by ceasing to live i am of the same opinion with you respecting the freedom of commerce especially in countries where direct taxes are practicable this will be our case in time when our wideextended country fills up with inhabitants but at present they are so widely settled often five or six miles distant from one another in the back country that a collection of a direct tax is almost impossible the trouble of the collectors going from house to house amounting to more than the value of the tax nothing can be better expressed than your sentiments are on this point where you prefer liberty of trading cultivating manufacturing etc even to civil liberty this being affected but rarely the other every hour our debt occasioned by the war being heavy we are under the necessity of using imposts and every method we can think of to assist in raising a revenue to discharge it but in sentiment we are well disposed to abolish duties on importation as soon as we possibly can afford to do so whatever may be reported by the english in europe you may be assured that our people are     almost unanimous in being satisfied with the revolution their unbounded respect for all who were principally concerned in it whether as warriors or statesmen and the enthusiastic joy with which the day of the declaration of independence is everywhere annually celebrated are indubitable proofs of this truth in one or two of the states there have been some discontents on partial and local subjects these may have been fomented as the accounts of them are exaggerated by our ancient enemies but they are nearly suppressed and the rest of the states enjoy peace and good order and flourish amazingly the crops have been good for several years past the price of country produce high from foreign demand and it fetches ready money rents are high in our towns which increase fast by new buildings laborers and artisans have high wages well paid and vast tracts of new land are continually clearing and rendered fit for cultivation the pains you have taken to translate the congratulatory addresses which i received on my arrival is a fresh proof of the continuance of your friendship for me which has afforded me as much satisfaction as the addresses themselves and you will readily believe that for me this is not saying little for this welcome of my fellowcitizens has far surpassed my hopes popular favor not the most constant thing in the world stands by me my election to the presidency for the second year was unanimous will this disposition continue the same for the third nothing is more doubtful a man who holds a high office finds himself so often exposed     to the danger of disobliging some one in the fulfilment of his duty that the resentment of those whom he has thus offended being greater than the gratitude of those whom he has served it almost always happens that while he is violently attacked he is feebly defended you will not be surprised then if you learn that i have not closed my political career with the same éclat with which it commenced i am sorry for what you tell me of the indisposition you have experienced i sometimes wonder that providence does not protect the good from all evil and from every suffering this should be so in the best of worlds and since it is not so i am piously led to believe that if our world is not indeed the best we must lay the blame on the bad quality of materials of which it is made i am my dear friend with sincere esteem and affection ever yours b franklin benjamin franklin    may      philadelphia thomas jordan mcccclxiii to thomas jordan philadelphia    may      dear sir— i received your very kind letter of february   th together with the cask of porter you have been so good as to send me we have at present what the french call une assemblée des notables a convention composed of some of the principal people from the several states of our confederation they did me the honor of dining with me last wednesday when the cask was broached and its contents met with the most cordial reception   0 and universal approbation in short the company agreed unanimously that it was the best porter they had ever tasted accept my thanks a poor return but all i can make at present your letter reminds me of many happy days we have passed together and the dear friends with whom we passed them some of whom alas have left us and we must regret their loss although our hawkesworth is become an adventurer in more happy regions and our stanley  gone where only his own harmony can be exceeded you give me joy in telling me that you are on the pinnacle of content without it no situation can be happy with it any one means of becoming content with ones situation is the comparing it with a worse thus when i consider how many terrible diseases the human body is liable to i comfort myself that only three incurable ones have fallen to my share viz the gout the stone and old age and that these have not yet deprived me of my natural cheerfulness my delight in books and enjoyment of social conversation i am glad to hear that mr fitzmaurice is married and has an amiable lady and children it is a better plan than he once proposed of getting mrs wright to make him a waxwork wife to sit at the head of his table for after all wedlock is the natural state of man a bachelor is not a complete human being he is like the odd half of a pair of scissors which has not yet found its fellow and therefore is not even half so useful as they might be together     i hardly know which to admire most the wonderful discoveries made by herschel or the indefatigable ingenuity by which he has been enabled to make them let us hope my friend that when free from these bodily embarrassments we may roam together through some of the systems he has explored conducted by some of our old companions already acquainted with them hawkesworth will enliven our progress with his cheerful sensible converse and stanley accompany the music of the spheres mr watmaugh tells me for i immediately inquired after her that your daughter is alive and well i remember her a most promising and beautiful child and therefore do not wonder that she is grown as he says a fine woman god bless her and you my dear friend and every thing that pertains to you is the sincere prayer of yours most affectionately b franklin benjamin franklin    may      philadelphia george whately mcccclxiv to george whately philadelphia    may      i received duly my good old friends letter of the   th of february i thank you much for your notes on banks they are just and solid as far as i can judge of them our bank here has met with great opposition partly from envy and partly from those who wish an emission of more paper money which they think the bank influence prevents but it has stood all attacks and went on well notwithstanding the assembly repealed its charter a new assembly     has restored it and the management is so prudent that i have no doubt of its continuing to go on well the dividend has never been less than six per cent nor will that be augmented for some time as the surplus profit is reserved to face accidents the dividend of eleven per cent which was once made was from a circumstance scarce avoidable a new company was proposed and prevented only by admitting a number of new partners as many of the first set were averse to this and chose to withdraw it was necessary to settle their accounts so all were adjusted the profits shared that had been accumulated and the new and old proprietors jointly began on a new and equal footing their notes are always instantly paid on demand and pass on all occasions as readily as silver because they will always produce silver your medallion is in good company it is placed with those of lord chatham lord camden marquis of rockingham sir george saville and some others who honored me with a show of friendly regard when in england i believe i have thanked you for it but i thank you again i believe with you that if our plenipo is desirous of concluding a treaty of commerce he may need patience if i were in his place and not otherwise instructed i should be apt to say take your own time gentlemen if the treaty cannot be made as much to your advantage as to ours dont make it i am sure the want of it is not more to our disadvantage than to yours let the merchants on both sides treat with one another laissezles faire     i have never considered attentively the congress scheme for coining and i have it not now at hand so that at present i can say nothing to it the chief uses of coining seem to be the ascertaining the fineness of the metals and saving the time that would otherwise be spent in weighing to ascertain the quality but the convenience of fixed values to pieces is so great as to force the currency of some whose stamp is worn off that should have assured their fineness and which are evidently not of half their due weight the case at present with the sixpences in england which one with another do not weigh threepence you are now seventyeight and i am eightytwo you tread fast upon my heels but though you have more strength and spirit you cannot come up with me till i stop which must now be soon for i am grown so old as to have buried most of the friends of my youth and i now often hear persons whom i knew when children called old mr suchaone to distinguish them from their sons now men grown and in business so that by living twelve years beyond davids period i seem to have intruded myself into the company of posterity when i ought to have been abed and asleep yet had i gone at seventy it would have cut off twelve of the most active years of my life employed too in matters of the greatest importance but whether i have been doing good or mischief is for time to discover i only know that i intended well and i hope all will end well be so good as to present my affectionate respects to dr riley i am under great obligations to him     and shall write to him shortly it will be a pleasure to him to know that my malady does not grow sensibly worse and that is a great point for it has always been so tolerable as not to prevent my enjoying the pleasures of society and being cheerful in conversation i owe this in a great measure to his good counsels adieu my dear friend and believe me ever yours most affectionately b franklin count de campomanes    may      madrid benjamin franklin mcccclxv from count de campomanes madrid    may      sir— i have received your letter of the  th of december directed to me as a member of the american philosophical society and accompanied by the second volume of the transactions of the society containing the statutes of that body a list of its members and various experiments observations and writings chiefly relative to the natural and exact sciences for this mark of attention i am much indebted to your excellency as well as to our society in whose works i now feel a personal interest since they have done me the honor to make me one of their body in these writings also i discover so much judgment sound criticism and intelligence in regard to the subjects on which they treat that i am persuaded they will contribute effectually to extend and promote useful knowledge the laudable object for which our society was instituted and its     labors being renewed by the return of peace may soon rival those of the most ancient and celebrated institutions of a similar kind in europe in the midst of my public duties at the head of the council which station i have held for the last three years the society and its illustrious president will always find me ready to contribute to its service as far as the circumstances of my situation will admit and as often as subjects occur which may appear to answer the ends in view with the books which our academy of history has sent to your excellency is the first volume of the diccionario español latinoarabigo printed under my direction i have prefixed to it a discourse on the utility of the study of the arabic language particularly for spaniards a consideration which induced me to devote to the study of this language in my youth such leisure as i could spare from the business of my profession the remaining volumes are in press and i shall take care to forward them as soon as they are published your letter with the gift accompanying it has renewed the sentiments of gratitude which i entertained for your former favors and the esteem and friendship which i have always expressed for your character may your life be prolonged many and happy years i am etc count de campomanes     benjamin franklin  0 may      philadelphia jane mecom mcccclxvi to mrs jane mecom philadelphia  0 may      dear sister— in your letter of march  th you mention that you wanted to know all about my buildings to the east end of my dwellinghouse i have made an addition of      feet wide and    feet long that is the whole length of the old house so that the front and back of the old and new building range even and the row of windows eaves and roof are continued so as to appear but one building by this addition i have gained a large cellar for wood a drawingroom or diningroom on the same level with our old diningroom in which new room we can dine a company of    persons it being    feet wide and  0   long and it has two windows at each end the north and south which will make it an airy summer room and for winter there is a good chimney in the middle made handsome with marble slabs over this room is my library of the same dimensions with like windows at each end and lined with books to the ceiling over this are two lodgingrooms and over all a fine garret the way into the lower room is out of the entry passing by the foot of the stairs into the library i go through one of the closets of the old drawingroom or bedchamber and into the two new rooms above through a passage cut off from the nursery all these rooms are now finished and inhabited very much to the convenience of the family who were before too much crowded     the two new houses next the street are three stories high besides the garrets and an arched passage is left in the middle between them to come through down to my dwelling wide enough for a carriage so that i have the old passage lot left free to build another house the two houses are    feet front each and    deep we are all well and join in love to you and yours i am ever your affectionate brother b franklin thomas paine    june      paris benjamin franklin mcccclxvii from thomas paine paris    june      my dear sir— we left new york on the   th of april and arrived at havre de grâce on the   th of may i set off in company with m gernon a french gentleman passenger from america for paris i stayed one day at rouen to take a view of the place from whence the kings of england date their origin there are yet some remains of the palaces of the dukes of normandy but the parliament house has such a resemblance to westminster hall i mean the great hall as you enter that had i not known i had been in normandy i might have supposed myself at london the breadth of the room is nearly seventy feet and the roof is constructed exactly in the manner of that at westminster the country from havre to rouen is the richest i ever saw the crops are abundant and the cultivation in nice and beautiful order every thing appeared     to be in fulness the people very stout the women exceedingly fair and the horses of a vast size and very fat i saw several at havre that were seventeen hands high i deposited the model of the bridge at the customhouse the superintendent of which undertook to send it to paris as soon as an order should be procured for that purpose as he did not think himself authorized to do it without it being an imported article i arrived at paris on the  0th may and the next day began delivering the letters you were so kind as to honor me with my reception here in consequence of them has been abundantly cordial and friendly i have received visits and invitations from all who were in town the duke de rochefoucauld and general chastellux are in the country i dined yesterday with an old friend of yours m malesherbes who is of the new council of finances and who received me with a heartiness of friendship it must have been a very strong attachment to america that drew you from this country for your friends are very numerous and very affectionate m le roy has been most attentively kind to me as he speaks english there is scarcely a day passes without an interview he took me a few days ago to see an old friend of yours m buffon but we were informed by the servant that he was very ill and under the operation of medicine on which we deferred our intention in the evening he sent me an invitation to see an exhibition of fireworks of a new kind made of inflammable air it was done as an experiment the exhibition was in a room the     performer had two large bladders of air one under each arm with pipes from them communicating with the figures to be represented such as suns moons stars flowers architecture and figures of moving machinery by compressing the bladders and mixing the air he produced the most beautiful and sudden transitions of light and colors increased or diminished the motion and exhibited the most pleasing scene of that kind that can be imagined the model from havre is not yet arrived but a letter received from thence yesterday informs me that it is on the road and will be here in about eight days there is a great curiosity here to see it as bridges have lately been a capital subject a new bridge is begun over the seine opposite the palais de bourbon and the place de louis quinze it is about the breadth of the schuylkill and the abbé morley tells me will cost five millions of livres it is on piers your old friend m terenet the bridge architect is yet living i was introduced to him by m le roy he has taken a residence in the elysian fields for the purpose of being near the works he has invited me to see his house at paris where all his drawings and models are by the next packet i will write to you respecting the opinion of the academy on the model i shall be obliged to mr clymer to send me some philadelphia and american news please to present me with much respect to your family and to all my good friends around you i am dear sir your

and in all laws for supplying the treasury the delegates of the several states shall have suffrage in proportion to the sums their respective states had actually contributed to that treasury from their taxes or internal excises that in case general duties should be laid by impost on goods imported a liberal estimation shall be made of the amount of such impost paid in the price of the commodities by those states that import but     little and a proportionate addition shall be allowed of suffrage to such states and an equal diminution of the suffrage of the states importing remarks the steady course of public measures is most probably to be expected from a number a single persons measures may be good the successor often differs in opinion of those measures and adopts others often is ambitious of distinguishing himself by opposing them and offering new projects one is peaceably disposed another may be fond of war etc hence foreign states can never have that confidence in the treaties or friendship of such a government as in that which is conducted by a number the single head may be sick who is to conduct the public affairs in that case when he dies who are to conduct till a new election if a council why not continue them shall we not be harassed with factions for the election of successors and become like poland weak from our dissensions consider the present distracted condition of holland they had at first a stadtholder the prince of orange a man of undoubted and great merit they found some inconveniences however in the extent of powers annexed to that office and exercised by a single person on his death they resumed and divided those powers among the states and cities but there has been a constant struggle since between that family and the nation in the last century the then     prince of orange found means to inflame the populace against their magistrates excite a general insurrection in which an excellent minister dewitt was murdered all the old magistrates displaced and the stadtholder reinvested with all the former powers in this century the father of the present stadtholder having married a british princess did by exciting another insurrection force from the nation a decree that the stadtholdership should be thenceforth hereditary in his family and now his son being suspected of having favored england in the war and thereby lost the confidence of the nation is forming an internal faction to support his power and reinstate his favorite the duke of brunswick and he holds up his family alliances with england and prussia to terrify opposition it was this conduct of the stadtholder which induced the states to recur to the protection of france and put their troops under a french rather than the stadtholders german general the duke of brunswick and this is the source of all the present disorders in holland which if the stadtholder has abilities equal to his inclinations will probably after a ruinous and bloody civil war end in establishing an hereditary monarchy in his family count de buffon    july      au jardin du roi benjamin franklin mcccclxix from count de buffon au jardin du roi    july      my dear sir— i always feel under great obligations to you in finding that you sometimes think of     me and that in the midst of your great occupations you have been so thoughtful as to send me seeds and rare plants for the kings garden i should be delighted to learn something of the progress of your philosophical society of which you have been kind enough to elect me a member i have just finished my histoire naturelle de minéraux and if the society does not possess this work or if any volume is missing i should be most happy to forward it to you tell me also about your health which is much better than mine my pains are not very severe but they are almost without intermission your example however makes me hope that they may all go off for i understand that since your return to america your health has been restored i should like to hear so from yourself and to learn if you have used any particular remedy none of those which i have taken thus far have been of any avail a mild treatment being absolutely the only one which i can bear as your advice would certainly be useful to me and i should have more confidence in you than in all the physicians i should be glad to know from yourself what treatment or remedies you have found most beneficial accept the sentiments of strong and tender attachment with which i shall ever remain etc count de buffon p s—i am now printing a treatise on the properties and use of the magnet in which i show the close connection of electricity with magnetism and with the action of subterraneous fires in volcanoes i shall have the honor to send it to you as soon as it     is out my friend m fanjas de saint fond who has a great regard for you desires me to present to you his respects abbé morellet    july      auteuil benjamin franklin mcccclxx from the abbé morellet auteuil    july      my dear friend— i cannot express to you the pleasure your letters gave us especially the details into which you have gone respecting your health and all that particularly concerns yourself it is a delightful thought to us and one on which we love to dwell that at the age to which you have attained and after having pursued so honorable a career you have found in the bosom of your own country all those enjoyments of which your age is susceptible you know how much we desire their long continuance believe me our happiness would be incomplete without this hope i say this in the name of the whole academy of auteuil since its productions have afforded you an hours amusement here are more of them on which i shall be much pleased to have your opinion and that of your friends they are moreover in your own vein of pleasantry and somewhat i conceive in that of swift with rather less of his dark misanthropy at any rate dr jonathan and dr benjamin are the models on whom i fixed my eyes and perhaps nature herself has given me something of the turn of both in the art of speaking the truth in a jesting way     or without seeming to speak it the difficulty is that one cannot laugh outright at every thing which is truly laughable in the dedication of your college in the county of lancaster and the fine procession and the religious ceremony where were met together presbyterians episcopalians lutherans catholics moravians e tutti quanti there was toleration in practice i have translated the whole of the pamphlet which you sent me and had it inserted in our mercury i think indeed that many readers will not perceive its scope but it will not be thrown away upon every one you see that i continue to diffuse as far as is in my power religious tolerance but for all this i do not neglect the spirit of commercial liberality and i fear that the latter makes too little progress among you the duties on foreign merchandise which you think necessary in your country because you cannot levy direct taxes there i consider as opposed to freedom of trade when they are resorted to as sources of revenue but i fear lest they should come to be looked upon among you in the same light that they are throughout europe as a fine stroke of policy intended to increase national commerce and wealth at the expense of foreign commerce and wealth which is arrant folly i have reason to think that you may follow our example on this point since reading a pamphlet printed at philadelphia and as the titlepage bears read before the society for political inquiry at your house yourself being present in this the author recommends duties and prohibitions to secure     navigation from port to port in america as if with all her advantages in this line she had any cause to fear the rivalry of foreign nations as if she had not many more profitable modes of employing her capital and her men as if restraints upon her own commerce and that of foreign nations resulting from such legislation would not cause her to lose more than she could expect to gain as if she needed any other commercial regulations than would naturally grow out of a good market for her staple commodities her fisheries and the like when you spoke to me of duties on imports which you said you were obliged to impose in order to defray the public expenses and for the payment of the national debt and which you should repeal as soon as you could do without them and could levy a landtax although i did not approve such practice yet i looked upon it as honest and perhaps necessary for a time you impose duties that you may raise money this is plain but the author of your pamphlet levies imposts to secure to america her navigation and a balance of trade in her favor he already follows in the steps of european governments who have disguised all the tyranny they have exercised over commerce under these false pretences and i confess i should be very sorry to see you pursuing the same crooked course you have learned from the common channels of news what great changes have taken place here on this head there is too much to be said to make it the subject of a letter the most important events and the acts of m de calonne of the assembly of     notables and of the new administration may all be found in great printed books some copies of which will doubtless cross the atlantic and reach your hands if you take any interest in these things they will afford you greater facilities of information respecting them than a letter could do the only thing i can tell you which may be interesting to you is that our new minister of finance the archbishop of toulouse is a very well informed and intelligent man well skilled in managing affairs and men familiar with all sound principles and having resolution to put them in practice you must know that entire freedom of trade finds a place among the maxims of his administration and that he will subject it to no restriction but such as he may be forced to lay upon it by circumstances which he will always endeavor to remove and alter as far as may be in his power you are not ignorant perhaps that i can testify as to his way of thinking since i have learned it in an acquaintance of nearly forty years which still subsists here is some hope for our country but previous disorders and other causes which i shall not mention to you may thwart or retard more or less the measures of this new administration and a crisis is at hand that may lay all our hopes in the dust but no matter i still hope as you know in the further progress of the human race and i have taken it into my head to embody this sentiment in a little allegory which i send you our lady of auteuil  enjoyed highly all the good     news you communicated to us about yourself and especially the letter you addressed to her she will answer you as will also the abbé de la roche her cats have somewhat diminished in numbers thanks to the bulldog your grandson left with us the trouble is that no one will rid us of boulet which is the french name she has given him here he still is for our sins his mistress places him at her side on one of her fourteen chaiseslongues and he is the master of the house we his humble servants obliged to open the door for him about forty or fifty times in an evening but she received him from your grandson and that is a good reason for us to bear patiently all the trouble he inflicts on us we are looking impatiently for news of the proceedings of your convention for uniting together the parties in your political state—a union without which you can have neither perfect prosperity nor real tranquillity the work  of your excellent countryman mr jefferson which i have translated has been much liked here it has been very well received and i consider its principles very sound and the facts well arranged if any thing appears in your country which you at all like especially relating to subjects connected with commerce or to your constitution i shall be much obliged to you if you will take advantage of some opportunity to send it to me mr paine came to me in due time he may have written you word that i had restored to him his iron bridge which our revenue officers had seized at     havre as contraband goods or subject to duties but it appeared on examination that the customhouse had really neither prohibited nor taxed bridges which have hitherto been built only in the very places where they were to be used the customhouse officers had not foreseen that it might one day happen that a bridge should be constructed in philadelphia or new york to be thrown over the seine in paris they are now aware of the fact and will not forget this article in the new tariff they must also enter houses on the list if you acquire the habit of making them for europeans yesterday the parliament of paris urged for three weeks and more to record a stamp tax with a new land tax in order by new financial resources to cover the enormous deficit which m de calonne had suffered to take place in our affairs moved and seemed to adhere to the following resolution that this parliament has not the power nor right to accept and sanction new imposts that this right pertains only to the statesgeneral of the kingdom which the king is besought to convoke immediately what an important change you here see in the maxims of our sovereign courts which have at least for several ages exercised and maintained the right which they seem now to renounce the most acute politicians can foresee but imperfectly to what this demand and an assembly of the statesgeneral should it take place will lead the event alone can enlighten us on this point it may be seen by this fact as well as by many others that a great change has taken place in the ideas which nations have   0 entertained of governments and the relations between the governing and governed parties i must still believe in accordance with my principles concerning the perfectibility of the human race that every thing is for the best to which we are ever tending though we sometimes seem to recede from it we do not hear often enough from mr franklin your grandson i wish to know how he likes philadelphia and whether he does us the honor to feel any regrets on our behalf i mean as respects our way of life for as regards ourselves individually he would be very ungrateful not to do so since he owes some remembrance to persons who have known both his talents and his amiable character and have appreciated them i beg that he will rank me in this number and accept my compliments monsieur and madame marmontel and all my family desire to be remembered to you and charge me to express to you the pleasure they feel in the good news you gave us of your health and situation i shall never forget the happiness i have enjoyed in knowing you and seeing you intimately i write to you from auteuil seated in your armchair on which i have had engraved benjamin franklin hîc sedebat and having by my side the little bureau which you bequeathed to me at parting with a drawerful of nails to gratify the love of nailing and hammering which i possess in common with you but believe me i have no need of all these helps to cherish your endeared remembrance and to love you dum memor ipse mei dum spiritus hos reget artus the

et bonne ami vigniville helvétius     benjamin franklin  0 september      philadelphia jane mecom mcccclxxii to mrs jane mecom philadelphia  0 september      dear sister— i received your kind letter of the   th past which gave me the great pleasure of learning that you were well i thought i had before acknowledged the receipt of yours per colonel sergeant the convention finished the   th instant i attended the business of it five hours in every day from the beginning which is something more than four months you may judge from thence that my health continues some tell me i look better and they suppose the daily exercise of going and returning from the statehouse has done me good you will see the constitution we have proposed in the papers the forming of it so as to accommodate all the different interests and views was a difficult task and perhaps after all it may not be received with the same unanimity in the different states that the convention have given the example of in delivering it out for their consideration we have however done our best and it must take its chance i agree with you perfectly in your disapprobation of war abstracted from the inhumanity of it i think it wrong in point of human prudence for whatever advantage one nation would obtain from another whether it be part of their territory the liberty of commerce with them free passage on their rivers etc it would be much cheaper to purchase such advantage with ready money than to pay the     expense of acquiring it by war an army is a devouring monster and when you have raised it you have in order to subsist it not only the fair charges of pay clothing provisions arms and ammunition with numberless other contingent and just charges to answer and satisfy but you have all the additional knavish charges of the numerous tribe of contractors to defray with those of every other dealer who furnishes the articles wanted for your army and takes advantage of that want to demand exorbitant prices it seems to me that if statesmen had a little more arithmetic or were more accustomed to calculation wars would be much less frequent i am confident that canada might have been purchased from france for a tenth part of the money england spent in the conquest of it and if instead of fighting with us for the power of taxing us she had kept us in good humor by allowing us to dispose of our own money and now and then giving us a little of hers by way of donation to colleges or hospitals or for cutting canals or fortifying ports she might have easily drawn from us much more by our occasional voluntary grants and contributions than ever she could by taxes sensible people will give a bucket or two of water to a dry pump that they may afterward get from it all they have occasion for her ministry were deficient in that little point of common sense and so they spent one hundred millions of her money and after all lost what they contended for i lament the loss your town has suffered this year by fire i sometimes think men do not act like reasonable creatures when they build for themselves     combustible dwellings in which they are every day obliged to use fire in my new buildings i have taken a few precautions not generally used to wit none of the wooden work of one room communicates with the wooden work of any other room and all the floors and even the steps of the stairs are plastered close to the boards besides the plastering on the laths under the joists there are also trapdoors to go out upon the roofs that one may go out and wet the shingles in case of a neighboring fire but indeed i think the staircases should be stone and the floors tiled as in paris and the roofs either tiled or slated i am much obliged to your friend and neighbor mr lathrop for his kind present and purpose writing to him it is a discourse well written i sent you lately a barrel of flour and i blame myself for not sooner desiring you to lay in your winters wood and drawing upon me for it as last year but i have been so busy to avoid such neglect in future i now make the direction general that you draw on me every year for the same purpose adieu my dear sister and believe me ever your affectionate brother b franklin benjamin franklin  0 september      philadelphia mcccclxxiii to arthur st clair and other delegates in congress in council philadelphia  0 september      gentlemen— enclosed is a letter to general clinton which we send unsealed for your perusal     with the several papers of intelligence that accompany it the council have thought of sending a few resolute men authorized to apprehend and bring off franklin and jenkins but if they should be on the york side of the line it might be impracticable without the concurrence of that government you will see that we have requested the governor to have a conference with you on the subject in which if it take place we desire you would not only discuss what may be proper for securing the ringleaders of the sedition but concert some general measures for the two states to take that it may be effectually and totally suppressed and that you would report to us the result of your conference as soon as may be p s—you will see the propriety and necessity of keeping the proceedings secret as well as the names of the informers and you will return the enclosed papers benjamin franklin    september      the letter to governor clinton which was enclosed was as follows in council    september      sir— your excellency will see by the papers and letters of intelligence which i have the honor of communicating to you that there are a number of disorderly people collecting near the line that divides our two states who are impatient of regular government and seize upon and presume to dispose of lands contrary to and in defiance of the laws it has appeared to me by other evidence that their numbers are daily increasing by vagabonds from all quarters     and that they expect reinforcements from shays late partisans and purpose defending their proceedings by force of arms your excellency will be sensible with us of the mischief such a body of banditti may be capable of occasioning to both our states if suffered to increase and establish themselves in that country the vicinity of the boundary line affording them at present an imaginary security since if pursued by the authority of one of the states they can easily step over into the others your excellencys readiness manifested on other occasions to aid the operations of general justice even in neighboring governments leaves no room to doubt of your concurring with us in the measures that may be necessary to defeat the projects of those people some of whose leaders are said to be inhabitants of your state for the concerting such measures the council of this government unanimously and earnestly request your excellency would be pleased to permit our delegates in congress to have a conference with you i have the honor to be etc b franklin president benjamin franklin    september      colonel john craig in council    september      sir— you are to take what number of militia you think necessary and proceed with the greatest despatch to wilkesbarre in the county of luzerne when there if you think it necessary consult colonel pickering on the best method you can take to apprehend john franklin john jenkins zerah beach and     john mckinstry should you take all or any of these men prisoners you are to bring them to philadelphia if you take franklin at wilkesbarre do not proceed any farther or run the risk of losing him by endeavoring to apprehend the others council have the utmost reliance on your secrecy and your prudence in conducting this affair if opposed by force you are to use force and execute the warrant at all events b franklin president to colonel john craig richard price    september      hackney benjamin franklin mcccclxxiv from richard price hackney    september      my dear friend— i am very happy when i think of the encouragement which you have given me to address you under this appellation your friendship i reckon indeed one of the distinctions of my life i frequently receive great pleasure from the accounts of you which dr rush and mr vaughan send me but i receive much greater pleasure from seeing your own hand i have lately been favored with two letters which have given me this pleasure the last of which acquaints me that my name has been added to the number of the corresponding members of the pennsylvania society for abolishing negro slavery of which you are president and also brought me a pamphlet containing the constitution and the laws     of pennsylvania which relate to the object of the society i hope you and the society will accept my thanks and believe that i am truly sensible of the honor done me as for any services i can do they are indeed but small for i find that far from possessing in the decline of life your vigor of body and mind every kind of business is becoming an incumbrance to me at the same time the calls of business increase upon me as you will learn in some measure from the report at the end of the discourse which you will receive with this letter a similar institution to yours for abolishing negro slavery is just formed in london and i have been desired to make one of the acting committee but i have begged to be excused i have sent you some of their papers i need not say how earnestly i wish success to such institutions something perhaps will be done with this view by the convention of delegates  this convention consisting of many of the first men in respect of wisdom and influence in the united states must be a most august and venerable assembly may god guide their deliberations the happiness of the world depends in some degree on the result i am waiting with patience for an account of it in this part of the world there is a spirit rising which must in time produce great effects i refer principally to what is now passing in holland brabant and france this spirit originated in america and should it appear that it has there   0 terminated in a state of society more favorable to peace virtue science and liberty and consequently to human happiness and dignity than has ever yet been known infinite good will be done indeed a general fermentation seems to be taking place through europe in consequence of the attention created by the american war and the dissemination of writings explaining the nature and the end of civil government the minds of men are becoming more enlightened and the silly despots of the world are likely to be forced to respect human rights and to take care not to govern too much lest they should not govern at all you are acquainted with mr paradise he has sailed with his family for virginia where he is the proprietor of a good estate his accomplishments as a scholar and his excellent principles as a citizen must make him useful there and i hope also happy  during the course of last spring and summer i frequently feared that my health was declining in order to recover it i have spent near two months in seabathing and dissipation at east bourne in sussex and i hope that i have gained some recruit of spirits for another winter be so good as to deliver my kind respects to mr vaughan when you see him i am much in his debt for two agreeable letters and i hope soon to write to him he is i doubt not useful where he is but as we have mrs vaughan with us we are in hopes he will not be long absent     last night the gazette told us that turkey has declared war against russia it has also told us that the king of prussia having entered holland with his army and taken possession of utrecht and many other towns has reinstated the stadtholder in all his honors and powers but at the same time our preparations for war by pressing sailors filling up regiments and creating admirals show that our ministers expect that the french will interpose and that they are determined to join the king of prussia in supporting the stadtholder against his constituents with all the best wishes i am most affectionately yours richard price benjamin franklin    september      philadelphia alexander small mcccclxxv to mr small philadelphia    september      dear sir— i received your kind letter of june        and i answered it though long after the receipt i do not perceive by your second favor of july      that my answer had then come to hand but i hope it may since that time i have not lost any of the principles of public economy you once knew me possessed of but to get the bad customs of a country changed and new ones though better introduced it is necessary first to remove the prejudices of the people enlighten their ignorance and to convince them that their interest will be promoted by the proposed changes and this     is not the work of a day our legislators are all landowners and they are not yet persuaded that all taxes are finally paid by the land besides our country is so sparsely settled the habitations particularly in the back countries being perhaps five or six miles distant from each other that the time and labor of the collector in going from house to house and being obliged to call often before he can recover the tax amounts to more than the tax is worth and therefore we have been forced into the mode of indirect taxes—that is duties on importation of goods and excises i have made no attempt to introduce the form of prayer here which you and good mrs baldwin do me the honor to approve the things of this world take up too much of my time of which indeed i have too little left to undertake any thing like a reformation in matters of religion when we can sow good seed we should however do it and wait when we can do no better with patience natures time for their sprouting some lie many years in the ground and at length certain favorable seasons or circumstances bring them forth with vigorous shoots and plentiful productions had i been at home as you wished soon after the peace i might possibly have mitigated some of the severities against the royalists believing as i do that fear and error rather than malice occasioned their desertion of their countrys cause and the adoption of the kings the public resentment against them is now so far abated that none who ask leave to return are refused and many of them     now live among us much at their ease as to the restoration of confiscated estates it is an operation that none of our politicians have as yet ventured to propose they are a sort of people that love to fortify themselves in their prospects by precedent perhaps they wait to see your government restore the forfeited estates in scotland to the scotch those in ireland to the irish and those in england to the welsh i am glad that the distressed exiles who remain with you have received or are likely to receive some compensation for their losses for i commiserate their situation it was clearly incumbent on the king to indemnify those he had seduced by his proclamations but it seems not so clearly consistent with the wisdom of parliament to resolve doing it for him if some mad king should think fit in a freak to make war upon his subjects of scotland or upon those of england by the help of scotland and ireland as the stuarts did may he not encourage followers by the precedent of these parliamentary gratuities and thus set his subjects to cutting one anothers throats first with the hope of sharing in confiscations and then with that of compensation in case of disappointment the council of brutes without a fable were aware of this lest that fable may perhaps not have fallen in your way i enclose a copy of it your commercial treaty with france seems to show a growing improvement in the sentiments of both nations in the economical science all europe might be a great deal happier with a little more     understanding we in america have lately had a convention for framing a new constitution enclosed i send you the result of their deliberations whether it will be generally acceptable and carried into execution is yet to be seen but present appearances are in its favor i am always glad to hear from you and of your welfare i remember with pleasure the happy days we have spent together adieu and believe me ever my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin thomas jefferson    october      philadelphia mcccclxxvi thomas jefferson to ——  philadelphia    october         dr franklin has gained much credit within doors for his conduct and was the person who proposed the general signature he had prepared his address in writing the exertion of speaking being too great they allowed another to read it the day previous he sent for the pennsylvania delegates and it was reported that he did it to acquaint them of his disapprobation of certain points and     the impossibility of agreeing to them his views were different he wanted to allay every possible scruple and make their votes unanimous some of the sentiments of the address were as follows we have been long together every possible objection has been combated with so many different and contending interests it is impossible that any one can obtain every object of their wishes we have met to make mutual sacrifices for the general good and we have at last come fully to understand each other and settle the terms delay is as unnecessary as the adoption is important i confess it does not fully accord with my sentiments but i have lived long enough to have often experienced that we ought not to rely too much on our own judgments i have often found i was mistaken in my most favorite ideas i have upon the present occasion given up upon mature reflection many points which at the beginning i thought myself immovably and decidedly in favor of this renders me less tenacious of the remainder there is a possibility of my being mistaken the general principle which has presided over our deliberations now guides my sentiments i repeat i do materially object to certain points and have already stated my objections but i do declare that these objections shall never escape me without doors as upon the whole i esteem the constitution to be the best possible that could have been formed under present circumstances and that it ought to go abroad with one united signature and receive every support and countenance from us i trust none will refuse to sign it if they do they will     put me in mind of the french girl who was always quarrelling and finding fault with every one around her and told her sister that she thought it very extraordinary but that really she had never found a person who was always in the right but herself mcccclxxvii speech in the convention on the subject of salaries sir— it is with reluctance that i rise to express a disapprobation of any one article of the plan for which we are so much obliged to the honorable gentleman who laid it before us from its first reading i have borne a goodwill to it and in general wished it success in this particular of salaries to the executive branch i happen to differ and as my opinion may appear new and chimerical it is only from a persuasion that it is right and from a sense of duty that i hazard it the committee will judge of my reasons when they have heard them and their judgment may possibly change mine i think i see inconveniences in the appointment of salaries i see none in refusing them but on the contrary great advantages sir there are two passions which have a powerful influence in the affairs of men these are ambition and avarice the love of power and the love of money separately each of these has great force in prompting men to action but when united in view of the same     object they have in many minds the most violent effects place before the eyes of such men a post of honor that shall at the same time be a place of profit and they will move heaven and earth to obtain it the vast number of such places it is that renders the british government so tempestuous the struggles for them are the true source of all those factions which are perpetually dividing the nation distracting its councils hurrying it sometimes into fruitless and mischievous wars and often compelling a submission to dishonorable terms of peace and of what kind are the men that will strive for this profitable preëminence through all the bustle of cabal the heat of contention the infinite mutual abuse of parties tearing to pieces the best of characters it will not be the wise and moderate the lovers of peace and good order the men fittest for the trust it will be the bold and the violent the men of strong passion and indefatigable activity in their selfish pursuits these will thrust themselves into your government and be your rulers and these too will be mistaken in the expected happiness of their situation for their vanquished competitors of the same spirit and from the same motives will perpetually be endeavoring to distress their administration thwart their measures and render them odious to the people besides these evils sir though we may set out in the beginning with moderate salaries we shall find that such will not be of long continuance reasons will never be wanting for proposed augmentations     and there will always be a party for giving more to the rulers that the rulers may be able in return to give more to them hence as all history informs us there has been in every state and kingdom a constant kind of warfare between the governing and the governed the one striving to obtain more for its support and the other to pay less and this has alone occasioned great convulsions actual civil wars ending either in dethroning of the princes or enslaving of the people generally indeed the ruling power carries its point and we see the revenues of princes constantly increasing and we see that they are never satisfied but always in want of more the more the people are discontented with the oppression of taxes the greater need the prince has of money to distribute among his partisans and pay the troops that are to suppress all resistance and enable him to plunder at pleasure there is scarce a king in a hundred who would not if he could follow the example of pharaoh—get first all the peoples money then all their lands and then make them and their children servants for ever it will be said that we do not propose to establish kings i know it but there is a natural inclination in mankind to kingly government it sometimes relieves them from aristocratic domination they had rather have one tyrant than five hundred it gives more of the appearance of equality among citizens and that they like i am apprehensive therefore—perhaps too apprehensive—that the government of these states may in future times end in a monarchy but this catastrophe i think may be long delayed if in     our proposed system we do not sow the seeds of contention faction and tumult by making our posts of honor places of profit if we do i fear that though we employ at first a number and not a single person the number will in time be set aside it will only nourish the fœtus of a king as the honorable gentleman from virginia very aptly expressed it and a king will the sooner be set over us it may be imagined by some that this is an utopian idea and that we can never find men to serve us in the executive department without paying them well for their services i conceive this to be a mistake some existing facts present themselves to me which incline me to a contrary opinion the high sheriff of a county in england is an honorable office but it is not a profitable one it is rather expensive and therefore not sought for but yet it is executed and well executed and usually by some of the principal gentlemen of the county in france the office of counsellor or member of their judiciary parliaments is more honorable it is therefore purchased at a high price there are indeed fees on the law proceedings which are divided among them but these fees do not amount to more than three per cent on the sum paid for the place therefore as legal interest is there at five per cent they in fact pay two per cent for being allowed to do the judiciary business of the nation which is at the same time entirely exempt from the burden of paying them any salaries for their services i do not however mean to recommend this as an eligible mode for our judiciary department i only bring the instance to show that   0 the pleasure of doing good and serving their country and the respect such conduct entitles them to are sufficient motives with some minds to give up a great portion of their time to the public without the mean inducement of pecuniary satisfaction another instance is that of a respectable society who have made the experiment and practised it with success now more than a hundred years i mean the quakers it is an established rule with them that they are not to go to law but in their controversies they must apply to their monthly quarterly and yearly meetings committees of these sit with patience to hear the parties and spend much time in composing their differences in doing this they are supported by a sense of duty and the respect paid to usefulness it is honorable to be so employed but it was never made profitable by salaries fees or perquisites and indeed in all cases of public service the less profit the greater the honor to bring the matter nearer home have we not seen the greatest and most important of our offices that of general of our armies executed for eight years together without the smallest salary by a patriot whom i will not now offend by any other praise and this through fatigues and distresses in common with the other brave men his military friends and companions and the constant anxieties peculiar to his station and shall we doubt finding three or four men in all the united states with public spirit enough to bear sitting in peaceful council for perhaps an equal term merely to preside over our civil concerns and see that our laws are duly     executed sir i have a better opinion of our country i think we shall never be without a sufficient number of wise and good men to undertake and execute well and faithfully the office in question sir the saving of the salaries that may at first be proposed is not an object with me the subsequent mischiefs of proposing them are what i apprehend and therefore it is that i move the amendment if it is not seconded or accepted i must be contented with the satisfaction of having delivered my opinion frankly and done my duty mcccclxxviii speech in a committee of the convention on the proportion of representation and votes mr chairman— it has given me great pleasure to observe that till this point the proportion of representation came before us our debates were carried on with great coolness and temper if any thing of a contrary kind has on this occasion appeared i hope it will not be repeated for we are sent hither to consult not to contend with each other and declarations of a fixed opinion and of determined resolutions never to change it neither enlighten nor convince us positiveness and warmth on one side naturally beget their like on the other and tend to create and augment discord and division in a great concern wherein harmony and union are extremely     necessary to give weight to our counsels and render them effectual in promoting and securing the common good i must own that i was originally of opinion it would be better if every member of congress or our national council were to consider himself rather as a representative of the whole than as an agent for the interests of a particular state in which case the proportion of members for each state would be of less consequence and it would not be very material whether they voted by states or individually but as i find this is not to be expected i now think the number of representatives should bear some proportion to the number of the represented and that the decisions should be by the majority of members not by the majority of states this is objected to from an apprehension that the greater states would then swallow up the smaller i do not at present clearly see what advantage the greater states could propose to themselves by swallowing the smaller and therefore do not apprehend they would attempt it i recollect that in the beginning of this century when the union was proposed of the two kingdoms england and scotland the scotch patriots were full of fears that unless they had an equal number of representatives in parliament they should be ruined by the superiority of the english they finally agreed however that the different proportions of importance in the union of the two nations should be attended to whereby they were to have only forty members in the house of commons and only sixteen of their peers were to sit in the house of lords a very great     inferiority of numbers and yet to this day i do not recollect that any thing has been done in the parliament of great britain to the prejudice of scotland and whoever looks over the lists of public officers civil and military of that nation will find i believe that the north britons enjoy at least their full proportion of emolument but sir in the present mode of voting by states it is equally in the power of the lesser states to swallow the greater and this is mathematically demonstrable suppose for example that seven smaller states had each three members in the house and the six larger to have one with another six members and that upon a question two members of each smaller state should be in the affirmative and one in the negative they will make affirmatives    negatives   and that all the large states should be unanimously in the negative they would make  negatives      in all    it is then apparent that the    carry the question against the    and the minority overpowers the majority contrary to the common practice of assemblies in all countries and ages the greater states sir are naturally as unwilling to have their property left in the disposition of the smaller as the smaller are to leave theirs in the disposition of the greater an honorable gentleman has to avoid this difficulty hinted a proposition of     equalizing the states it appears to me an equitable one and i should for my own part not be against such a measure if it might be found practicable formerly indeed when almost every province had a different constitution some with greater others with fewer privileges it was of importance to the borderers when their boundaries were contested whether by running the division lines they were placed on one side or the other at present when such differences are done away it is less material the interest of a state is made up of the interests of its individual members if they are not injured the state is not injured small states are more easily well and happily governed than large ones if therefore in such an equal division it should be found necessary to diminish pennsylvania i should not be averse to the giving a part of it to new jersey and another to delaware but as there would probably be considerable difficulties in adjusting such a division and however equally made at first it would be continually varying by the augmentation of inhabitants in some states and their more fixed proportion in others and thence frequent occasion for new divisions i beg leave to propose for the consideration of the committee another mode which appears to me to be as equitable more easily carried into practice and more permanent in its nature let the weakest state say what proportion of money or force it is able and willing to furnish for the general purposes of the union let all the others oblige themselves to furnish each an equal proportion     the whole of these joint supplies to be absolutely in the disposition of congress the congress in this case to be composed of an equal number of delegates from each state and their decisions to be by the majority of individual members voting if these joint and equal supplies should on particular occasions not be sufficient let congress make requisitions on the richer and more powerful states for further aids to be voluntarily afforded so leaving each state the right of considering the necessity and utility of the aid desired and of giving more or less as it should be found proper this mode is not new it was formerly practised with success by the british government with respect to ireland and the colonies we sometimes gave even more than they expected or thought just to accept and in the last war carried on while we were united they gave us back in five years a million sterling we should probably have continued such voluntary contributions whenever the occasions appeared to require them for the common good of the empire it was not till they chose to force us and to deprive us of the merit and pleasure of voluntary contributions that we refused and resisted those contributions however were to be disposed of at the pleasure of a government in which we had no representative i am therefore persuaded that they will not be refused to one in which the representation shall be equal my learned colleague has already mentioned that the present mode of voting by states was submitted     to originally by congress under a conviction of its impropriety inequality and injustice this appears in the words of their resolution it is of september        the words are resolved that in determining questions in this congress each colony or province shall have one vote the congress not being possessed of or at present able to procure materials for ascertaining the importance of each colony mcccclxxix motion for prayers in the convention mr president— the small progress we have made after four or five weeks close attendance and continual reasonings with each other our different sentiments on almost every question several of the last producing as many noes as ayes is methinks a melancholy proof of the imperfection of the human understanding we indeed seem to feel our own want of political wisdom since we have been running all about in search of it we have gone back to ancient history for models of government and examined the different forms of those republics which having been originally formed with the seeds of their own dissolution now no longer exist and we have viewed modern states all round europe but find none of their constitutions suitable to our circumstances in this situation of this assembly groping as it     were in the dark to find political truth and scarce able to distinguish it when presented to us how has it happened sir that we have not hitherto once thought of humbly applying to the father of lights to illuminate our understandings in the beginning of the contest with britain when we were sensible of danger we had daily prayers in this room for the divine protection our prayers sir were heard—and they were graciously answered all of us who were engaged in the struggle must have observed frequent instances of a superintending providence in our favor to that kind providence we owe this happy opportunity of consulting in peace on the means of establishing our future national felicity and have we now forgotten that powerful friend or do we imagine we no longer need its assistance i have lived sir a long time and the longer i live the more convincing proofs i see of this truth that god governs in the affairs of men and if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his notice is it probable that an empire can rise without his aid we have been assured sir in the sacred writings that except the lord build the house they labor in vain that build it i firmly believe this and i also believe that without his concurring aid we shall succeed in this political building no better than the builders of babel we shall be divided by our little partial local interests our projects will be confounded and we ourselves shall become a reproach and a byword down to future ages and what is worse mankind may hereafter from this unfortunate instance despair of establishing government by     human wisdom and leave it to chance war and conquest i therefore beg leave to move— that henceforth prayers imploring the assistance of heaven and its blessing on our deliberations be held in this assembly every morning before we proceed to business and that one or more of the clergy of this city be requested to officiate in that service      mcccclxxx dr franklins speech in the convention at the conclusion of its deliberations mr president— i confess that i do not entirely approve of this constitution at present but sir i am not sure i shall never approve it for having lived long i have experienced many instances of being obliged by better information or fuller consideration to change opinions even on important subjects which i once thought right but found to be otherwise it is therefore that the older i grow the more apt i am to doubt my own judgment of others most men indeed as well as most sects in religion think themselves in possession of all truth and that wherever others differ from them it is so far error steele a protestant in a dedication tells the pope that the only difference between our two churches in their opinions of the certainty of their doctrine is the romish church is infallible and the church of england is never in the wrong but though many private persons think almost as highly of their own infallibility as that of their sect few express it so   0 naturally as a certain french lady who in a little dispute with her sister said but i meet with nobody but myself that is always in the right je ne trouve que moi qui aie toujours raison in these sentiments sir i agree to this constitution with all its faults—if they are such—because i think a general government necessary for us and there is no form of government but what may be a blessing to the people if well administered and i believe further that this is likely to be well administered for a course of years and can only end in despotism as other forms have done before it when the people shall become so corrupted as to need despotic government being incapable of any other i doubt too whether any other convention we can obtain may be able to make a better constitution for when you assemble a number of men to have the advantage of their joint wisdom you inevitably assemble with those men all their prejudices their passions their errors of opinion their local interests and their selfish views from such an assembly can a perfect production be expected it therefore astonishes me sir to find this system approaching so near to perfection as it does and i think it will astonish our enemies who are waiting with confidence to hear that our counsels are confounded like those of the builders of babel and that our states are on the point of separation only to meet hereafter for the purpose of cutting one anothers throats thus i consent sir to this constitution because i expect no better and because i am not sure that it is not the best the opinions i have had of its     errors i sacrifice to the public good i have never whispered a syllable of them abroad within these walls they were born and here they shall die if every one of us in returning to our constituents were to report the objections he has had to it and endeavor to gain partisans in support of them we might prevent its being generally received and thereby lose all the salutary effects and great advantages resulting naturally in our favor among foreign nations as well as among ourselves from our real or apparent unanimity much of the strength and efficiency of any government in procuring and securing happiness to the people depends on opinion on the general opinion of the goodness of that government as well as of the wisdom and integrity of its governors i hope therefore for our own sakes as a part of the people and for the sake of our posterity that we shall act heartily and unanimously in recommending this constitution wherever our influence may extend and turn our future thoughts and endeavors to the means of having it well administered on the whole sir i cannot help expressing a wish that every member of the convention who may still have objections to it would with me on this occasion doubt a little of his own infallibility and to make manifest our unanimity put his name to this instrument then the motion was made for adding the last formula viz done in convention by the unanimous consent etc which was agreed to and added accordingly     mcccclxxxi a comparison of the conduct of the ancient jews and of the antifederalists in the united states of america a zealous advocate for the proposed federal constitution in a certain public assembly said that the repugnance of a great part of mankind to good government was such that he believed that if an angel from heaven was to bring down a constitution formed there for our use it would nevertheless meet with violent opposition he was reproved for the supposed extravagance of the sentiment and he did not justify it probably it might not have immediately occurred to him that the experiment had been tried and that the event was recorded in the most faithful of all histories the holy bible otherwise he might as it seems to me have supported his opinion by that unexceptionable authority the supreme being had been pleased to nourish up a single family by continued acts of his attentive providence till it became a great people and having rescued them from bondage by many miracles performed by his servant moses he personally delivered to that chosen servant in presence of the whole nation a constitution and code of laws for their observance accompanied and sanctioned with promises of great rewards and threats of severe punishments as the consequence of their obedience or disobedience this constitution though the deity himself was to be at its head and it is therefore called by political writers a theocracy could not be carried into execution     but by the means of his ministers aaron and his sons were therefore commissioned to be with moses the first established ministry of the new government one would have thought that the appointment of men who had distinguished themselves in procuring the liberty of their nation and had hazarded their lives in openly opposing the will of a powerful monarch who would have retained that nation in slavery might have been an appointment acceptable to a grateful people and that a constitution framed for them by the deity himself might on that account have been secure of a universal welcome reception yet there were in every one of the thirteen tribes some discontented restless spirits who were continually exciting them to reject the proposed new government and this from various motives many still retained an affection for egypt the land of their nativity and these whenever they felt any inconvenience or hardship though the natural and unavoidable effect of the change of their situation exclaimed against their leaders as the authors of their trouble and were not only for returning into egypt but for stoning their deliverers  those inclined to idolatry were displeased that their golden calf was destroyed many of the chiefs thought the new constitution might be injurious to their particular interests that the profitable places would be engrossed by the families and friends of moses and aaron and others equally wellborn excluded  in     josephus and the talmud we learn some particulars not so fully narrated in the scripture we are there told that corah was ambitious of the priesthood and offended that it was conferred on aaron and this as he said by the authority of moses only without the consent of the people he accused moses of having by various artifices fraudulently obtained the government and deprived the people of their liberties and of conspiring with aaron to perpetuate the tyranny in their family thus though corahs real motive was the supplanting of aaron he persuaded the people that he meant only the public good and they moved by his insinuations began to cry out let us maintain the common liberty of our respective tribes we have freed ourselves from the slavery imposed upon us by the egyptians and shall we suffer ourselves to be made slaves by moses if we must have a master it were better to return to pharaoh who at least fed us with bread and onions than to serve this new tyrant who by his operations has brought us into danger of famine then they called in question the reality of his conference with god and objected to the privacy of their meetings and the preventing any of the people from being present at the colloquies or even approaching the place as grounds of great suspicion they accused moses also of peculation as embezzling part of the golden spoons and the silver chargers that the princes had offered at the dedication of the altar  and the     offerings of gold by the common people  as well as most of the polltax  and aaron they accused of pocketing much of the gold of which he pretended to have made a molten calf besides peculation they charged moses with ambition to gratify which passion he had they said deceived the people by promising to bring them to a land flowing with milk and honey instead of doing which he had brought them from such a land and that he thought light of all this mischief provided he could make himself an absolute prince  that to support the new dignity with splendor in his family the partial polltax already levied and given to aaron  was to be followed by a general one  which would probably be augmented from time to time if he were suffered to go on promulgating new laws on pretence of new occasional revelations of the divine will till their whole fortunes were devoured by that aristocracy moses denied the charge of peculation and his accusers were destitute of proofs to support it though facts if real are in their nature capable of proof i have not said he with holy confidence in the presence of god i have not taken from this people the value of an ass nor done them any other injury but his enemies had made the charge and with some success among the populace for no kind of     accusation is so readily made or easily believed by knaves as the accusation of knavery in fine no less than two hundred and fifty of the principal men famous in the congregation men of renown  heading and exciting the mob worked them up to such a pitch of frenzy that they called out stone them stone them and thereby secure our liberties and let us choose other captains that may lead us back into egypt in case we do not succeed in reducing the canaanites on the whole it appears that the israelites were a people jealous of their newly acquired liberty which jealousy was in itself no fault but when they suffered it to be worked upon by artful men pretending public good with nothing really in view but private interest they were led to oppose the establishment of the new constitution whereby they brought upon themselves much inconvenience and misfortune it further appears from the same inestimable history that when after many ages that constitution was become old and much abused and an amendment of it was proposed the populace as they had accused moses of the ambition of making himself a prince and cried out stone him stone him so excited by their highpriests and scribes they exclaimed against the messiah that he aimed at becoming the king of the jews and cried crucify him crucify him from all which we may gather that popular opposition to a public measure is no proof of its impropriety even though the opposition be excited and headed by men of distinction     to conclude i beg i may not be understood to infer that our general convention was divinely inspired when it formed the new federal constitution merely because that constitution has been unreasonably and vehemently opposed yet i must own i have so much faith in the general government of the world by providence that i can hardly conceive a transaction of such momentous importance to the welfare of millions now existing and to exist in the posterity of a great nation should be suffered to pass without being in some degree influenced guided and governed by that omnipotent omnipresent and beneficent ruler in whom all inferior spirits live and move and have their being b franklin benjamin franklin    october      philadelphia laudriani mcccclxxxii to professor laudriani philadelphia    october      i have received the excellent work upon the utility of electrical conductors which you had the goodness to send me i read it with great pleasure and beg you to receive my sincere thanks for it upon my return to this country i found the number of conductors much increased many proofs of their efficacy in preserving buildings from lightning having demonstrated their utility among other instances my own house was one day attacked by lightning which occasioned the neighbors to run in to give assistance in case of its being on fire but     no damage was done and my family was only found a good deal frightened with the violence of the explosion last year my house being enlarged the conductor was obliged to be taken down i found upon examination that the pointed termination of copper which was originally nine inches long and about one third of an inch in diameter in its thickest part had been almost entirely melted and that its connection with the rod of iron below was very slight thus in the course of time this invention has proved of use to the author of it and has added this personal advantage to the pleasure he before received from having been useful to others mr rittenhouse our astronomer has informed me that having observed with his excellent telescope many conductors that are within the field of his view he has remarked in various instances that the points were melted in like manner there is no example of a house provided with a perfect conductor which has suffered any considerable damage and even those which are without them have suffered little since conductors have become common in this city b franklin benjamin franklin    october      philadelphia gaetano filangieri mcccclxxxiii to gaetano

 dear friend— i received by the last pacquet your favor of august  th but the things you mention sent by madame helvetius did not come in that ship and i wish you to enquire what became of them   0 i send you enclosed the proposed new federal constitution for these states i was engaged four months of the last summer in the convention that formed it it is now sent by congress to the several states for their confirmation if it succeeds i do not see why you might not in europe carry the project of good henry the fourth into execution by forming a federal union and one grand republic of all its different states and kingdoms by means of a like convention for we had many interests to reconcile i hope you and yours are well i continue so but am too full of business to write by this pacquet to my other friends i am glad you liked my young carolinian i have recommended another gentleman of that state to your civilities the hon mr charles pinckney member of congress and one of the late

gave me the pleasure of being informed that you were well i am glad you have made the provision against the winter which i mentioned to you your bill is honored it is impossible for me always to guess what you may want and i hope therefore that you will never be shy in letting me know wherein i can help to make your life more comfortable it was my intention to decline serving another year as president that i might be at liberty to take a trip to boston in the spring but i submit to the unanimous voice of my country which has again placed me in the chair i have now been upwards of fifty     years employed in public offices when i informed your good friend dr cooper that i was ordered to france being then seventy years old and observed that the public having as it were eaten my flesh seemed now resolved to pick my bones he replied that he approved their taste for that the nearer the bone the sweeter the meat i must own that it is no small pleasure to me and i suppose it will give my sister pleasure that after such a long trial of me i should be elected a third time by my fellowcitizens without a dissenting vote but my own to fill the most honorable post in their power to bestow this universal and unbounded confidence of a whole people flatters my vanity much more than a peerage could do hung oer with ribands and stuck round with strings may give nominal but not real honors this family are all well as i also am thanks to god we join in best wishes for you and yours and i am ever my dear sister your affectionate brother b franklin benjamin franklin    november      philadelphia count de buffon mcccclxxxvii to count de buffon philadelphia    november      dear sir— i am honored by your letter desiring to know by what means i am relieved in a disorder with which you are so unfortunately afflicted i have tried all the noted prescriptions for diminishing the stone without perceiving any good effect but     observing temperance in eating avoiding wine and cider and using daily the dumbbell which exercises the upper part of the body without much moving the parts in contact with the stone i think i have prevented its increase as the roughness of the stone lacerates a little the neck of the bladder i find that when the urine happens to be sharp i have much pain in making water and frequent urgencies for relief under these circumstances i take going to bed the bigness of a pigeons egg of jelly of blackberries the receipt for making it is enclosed while i continue to do this every night i am generally easy the day following making water pretty freely and with long intervals i wish most sincerely that this simple remedy may have the same happy effect with you perhaps currant jelly or the jelly of apples or of raspberries may be equally serviceable for i suspect the virtue of the jelly may lie principally in the boiled sugar which is in some degree candied by the boiling of the jelly wishing you for your own sake much more ease and for the sake of mankind many more years i remain with the greatest esteem and respect dear sir your most obedient and affectionate servant b franklin benjamin franklin    december      philadelphia jane mecom mcccclxxxviii to mrs jane mecom philadelphia    december      dear sister— since i wrote to you last your son collas has been here from north carolina where he     kept a store but it has not answered his expectations he wanted to take up goods on credit here but could not obtain any unless i would recommend it to our merchants to give it which i could not do without making myself liable and that i did not incline to do having no opinion either of the honesty and punctuality of the people with whom he proposed to traffic or of his skill and acuteness in merchandizing i wrote this merely to apologize for any seeming unkindness on my part in not so promoting his views you always tell me that you live comfortably but i sometimes suspect that you may be too unwilling to acquaint me with any of your difficulties from an apprehension of giving me pain i wish you would let me know precisely your situation that i may better proportion my assistance to your wants have you any money at interest and what does it produce or do you do some kind of business for a living if you have hazarded any of your stock in the abovementioned trading project i am afraid you will have but slender returns lest you should be straitened during the present winter i send you on corner of this sheet a bill of exchange on our cousin tuthill hubbart for fifty dollars which you can cut off and present to him for payment the barrel of flour i formerly mentioned to you as sent was not then sent through the forgetfulness or neglect of the merchant who promised to send it but i am told it is now gone and i hope will arrive safe i received your late letter with one from my dear     friend mrs greene and one from my good niece your daughter all which i have at present mislaid and therefore cannot now answer them particularly but shall as soon as i find them my love to all our relations and friends and believe me ever your affectionate brother b franklin benjamin franklin    december      philadelphia mcccclxxxix to ——— philadelphia    december      —— i hope the disorders in brabant and holland may be rectified without bloodshed but i fear the impending war with the turks if not prevented by prudent negotiation may in its consequences involve great part of europe i confide however that france and england will preserve their present peace with each other notwithstanding some contrary appearances for i think that they have both of them too much sense to go to war without an important cause as well as too little money at present as to the projected conquest of turkey i apprehend that if the emperor and empress would make some use of arithmetic and calculate what annual revenues may be expected from the country they want should they acquire it and then offer the grand seignior a hundred times that annual revenue to be paid down for an amicable purchase of it it would be his interest to accept the offer as well as theirs to make it rather than a war for it should take     place since a war to acquire that territory and to retain it will cost both parties much more perhaps ten times more than such sum of purchase money but the hope of glory and the ambition of princes are not subject to arithmetical calculation my best wishes attend you being with great esteem sir etc b franklin benjamin franklin    december      philadelphia mccccxc to the governor of georgia philadelphia    december      sir— i received by mr dromgoole the letter your excellency did me the honor of writing to me the  d of november past and am much concerned to hear that a war between the state of georgia and the creek indians was unavoidable during the course of a long life in which i have made observations on public affairs it has appeared to me that almost every war between the indians and whites has been occasioned by some injustice of the latter towards the former it is indeed extremely imprudent in us to quarrel with them for their lands as they are generally willing to sell and sell such good bargains and a war with them is so mischievous to us in unsettling frequently a great part of our frontier and reducing the inhabitants to poverty and distress and is besides so expensive that it is much cheaper as well as honester to buy their lands than to take them by force your state would i imagine be much more secure     from the mischiefs of indian wars if you imitated the mode of settlement in the new england states which was to grant their lands in townships of about six miles square to sixty families these first chose a spot for their town where they cleared a square of perhaps twenty acres round which they fixed their houses fifteen on a side all fronting inwards to the square so that they were all in sight of each other in the middle of the square they erected a house for public worship and a school stockaded round as a fort for the reception and protection of their women and children in case of alarm behind each house was first a garden plot then an orchard and then a pasture for a cow or two and behind all outwards their cornfield thus situated one house could not be attacked without its being seen and giving alarm to the rest who were ready to run to its succor this discouraged such attempts then they had the advantage of giving schooling to their children securing their morals by the influence of religion and improving each other by civil society and conversation in our way of sparse and remote settlements the people are without these advantages and we are in danger of bringing up a set of savages of our own color mccccxci to the printer of the evening herald  sir— the british newswriters are very assiduous in their endeavors to blacken america should we     not be careful not to afford them any assistance by censures of one another especially by censures not well founded i lately observed in one of your papers the conduct of the state of massachusetts reflected on as being inconsistent and absurd as well as wicked for attempting to raise a tax by a stamp act and for carrying on the slave trade the writer of those reflections might have considered that their principal objection to the stamp tax was its being imposed by a british parliament which had no right to tax them for otherwise a tax by stamps is perhaps to be levied with as little inconvenience as any other that can be invented ireland has a stamp tax of its own but should britain pretend to impose such a tax on the irish people they would probably give a general opposition to it and ought not for that to be charged with inconsistence one or two merchants in boston employing ships in the abominable african trade may deservedly be condemned though they do not bring their slaves home but sell them in the west indies the state as such has never that i have heard of given encouragement to the diabolical commerce and there have always been fewer slaves in the new england governments than in any other british colonies national reflections are seldom just and a whole people should not be decried for the crimes of a few individuals your inserting this may make that brave people some amends and will oblige one of your customers who is a pennsylvanian     benjamin franklin   january      philadelphia mather byles mccccxcii to mather byles  philadelphia   january      dear old friend— i duly received your kind letter of may   th i was then busily engaged in attending our general convention which added to the ordinary current business of this government took up so much of my time that i was obliged to postpone answering many letters of friends which gave occasion for mislaying some of them and among those was yours only last week come again to hand i think i never received what you mention respecting the university of aberdeen but the goodwill i might show on that occasion was not of importance enough to deserve your repeating the acknowledgment it was in me only paying a debt for i remember with gratitude that i owe one of my first academical honors to your recommendation it gives me much pleasure to understand that my points have been of service in the protection of you and yours i wish for your sake that electricity had really proved what it was at first supposed to be—a cure for the palsy it is however happy for you that when old age and that malady have concurred to enfeeble you and to disable you for writing you have a daughter at hand to nurse you with filial attention and to be your secretary of which i see she is very capable by the elegance and correctness of her writing in the letter i am now answering i too  00 have a daughter who lives with me and is the comfort of my declining years while my son is estranged from me by the part he took in the late war and keeps aloof residing in england whose cause he espoused whereby the old proverb is exemplified   my son is my son till he gets him a wife   but my daughters my daughter all the days of her life i remember you had a little collection of curiosities please to honor with a place in it the enclosed medal which i got struck in paris the thought was much approved by the connoisseurs there and the engraving well executed my best wishes attend you being ever your affectionate friend and humble servant b franklin alexander small   january      benjamin franklin mccccxciii from alexander small   january      dear sir— on the receipt of your most agreeable favor i immediately informed the baldwin family of your kind mention of them i certainly never received the first letter you allude to this being the only letter i have been favored with by you since your return to your free country people here think very differently of your freedom in general we are of opinion that your territory is too extensive for a popular government anarchy and despotism they allege must be the consequence they therefore  0  think it would be much wiser in you to adopt our limited government as you have taken so many useful hints from us you would naturally correct some errors that have crept into our constitution when you threw us off i did expect that we must have felt great diminution in our exports but what is singular our people have been all constantly employed we have some advantage over every nation in europe there is no nation in which the merchants have so great capitals or are of so enterprising dispositions we have fire and water everywhere and ingenuity to turn them to the best advantage we have the materials for great manufactories within ourselves such as iron steel lead copper and tin the whole island of anglesea is found to be a mass of copper and mr wilkinson who has the greatest foundry i believe in europe finds iron everywhere and mr wedgwood turns the clay which does not turn to account with mr wilkinson into beautiful earthenware did he make his exhibition of his very noble set sent to the empress of russia before you left england you see that so far as we can trace the descendants of attainted families their honors are restored the irish roman catholic families are most of them either engrafted into foreign families or are extinct those whose lands were in the crown by modern forfeiture have their estates restored to them by a general act of grace call back your banished people procure inhabitants and they will in time by their industry create wealth i think your present want of circulating cash may prove an advantage as  0  it may give a check to the luxury you had imported from us france may by and by exhibit a new scene of policy in europe wealth poured in upon her during the war promises to restrain the power of the crown and the king as a reward for the assistance he gave you in renouncing your brethren may have his own wings clipped you will probably most abundantly punish spain for i dare prophesy that in less than a century you will take possession of mexico thus the world goes round that you may live to see a good government established in your country and happily enjoy what of life remains to you is the sincere prayer of your affectionate etc alexander small benjamin franklin    february      philadelphia john ingenhousz mccccxciv to john ingenhousz philadelphia    february      my dear old friend— your letter of september         came to my hands about two weeks since it found me very ill with a severe fit of the stone which followed a fall i had on the stone steps that lead into my garden whereby i was much bruised and my wrist sprained so as to render me incapable of writing for several weeks i therefore requested mr vaughan to answer it for me which he has done in his letter that i enclose i will however add a  0  little as my hand is much strengthened though i still write with pain all the books you have sent to me and to the philosophical society here have been received they will be acknowledged in our next volume in the meantime please to accept our hearty thanks there are few books published in these times that contain so much new and useful knowledge as these you have written i lament with you the prospect of a horrid war which is likely to engage so great a part of mankind there is little good gained and so much mischief done generally by wars that i wish the imprudence of undertaking them was more evident to princes in which case i think they would be less frequent if i were counsellor of the empress of russia and found that she desired to possess some part of the dominions of the grand seignior i should advise her to compute the annual taxes raised from that territory and make him an offer of buying it at the rate of paying for it at twenty years purchase and if i were his counsellor i should advise him to take the money and cede the dominion of that territory for i am of opinion that a war to obtain it would cost her more than that sum and the event uncertain and that the defence of it will cost him as much and not having embraced the offer his loss is double but to make and accept such an offer these potentates should be both of them reasonable creatures and free from the ambition of glory which perhaps is too much to be supposed i am glad that peace is likely to be established in  0  your native country with so little expense of blood though it be done in a manner not agreeable to a great part of the nation if the french had entered with the prussians and made it the seat of war the mischief would have been infinite i am truly sorry for the losses you have met with in your attempts to make profit by commerce in this country jonathan williams was in england and ireland many months before i left france he has since been in different parts of america collecting his debts and now happens to be here i have talked with him about your affairs he tells me that your adventure to carolina sold well and that the produce was returned in indigo which if it had arrived would have rendered good profit and though his correspondent had taken the prudent precaution to insure in charleston the place being taken soon after and the insurers ruined nothing of value could be recovered and that he is a loser of a hundred guineas by the share he took in that unfortunate adventure i was mistaken when i informed you that his brother had given him your certificates it was only authenticated copies of them these he has now given me but i have written to john to give the originals to mr charles vaughan now in boston and to settle your account with that gentleman paying to him any bills that may be in hand which i make no doubt he will do such certificates are low in value at present but we hope and believe they will succeed when our new projected constitution of government is established i lent to the old congress three thousand pounds in  0  the value of hard money and took their certificates promising interest at six per cent but i have received no interest for several years and if i were now to sell the principal i could not get more than a sixth part you must not ascribe this to want of honesty in our government but to want of ability the war having exhausted all the faculties of the country the public funds even of great britain sunk by the war the three per cents from ninetyfive to fiftyfour we had powerful armies of enemies in our country ravaging plundering and destroying our towns and obstructing our agriculture while their fleets ruined our commerce and this for eight years together i question whether the public credit even of your rich country would have supported itself under similar treatment but we are recovering fast and if peace continues which god grant we shall soon be in flourishing circumstances i did not think i could have written so much i have done it however a little at a time i can now only add that i remain with unalterable esteem and affection my dear friend yours most sincerely b franklin benjamin franklin    february      philadelphia john de crèvecœur mccccxcv to st john de crèvecœur philadelphia    february      dear sir— i received last summer and should have sooner acknowledged one of the most agreeable of presents—your excellent work please  0  accept my cordial thanks for it as well as for the honorable mention you have been pleased to make of me the favorable view which you have taken of our country will i am persuaded have the good effect of deciding a certain number of distinguished europeans to come and settle among us an acquisition extremely advantageous to us i thank you also for the trouble you have taken about the package sent me by mr short enclosed is a letter for your excellent and very admirable friend madame de houdetot i wrote it at the commencement of the last year and supposing you to be still in france i sent it in an envelope to your address your arrival soon after the departure of the ship made me fear that the letter had been a long time delayed if not lost i am with great and sincere esteem b franklin    february p s—i had finished the above letter when i received yours of the  0th jan in which you ask my opinion about the steamboat of mr fitch i cannot get about readily and therefore have not seen it i have no doubt that the force of steam properly applied may suffice to move a boat against the current in most rivers yet when i consider the first expense of a machine such as a steamengine the necessity of always having a skilful machinist at a high salary to manage and repair it and the room which it will occupy on the vessel i will confess the fear i entertained lest the advantage would not be sufficient to bring the invention into common use though the  0  opinion you sent me of mr rittenhouse who is an excellent judge gives me a more favorable impression  benjamin franklin    february      philadelphia m le veillard mccccxcvi to m le veillard philadelphia    february      my dear friend— i received your kind letter of june   d by mr saugrain and it is the last of yours that is come to my hands as you have so much leisure and love writing i cannot think you have been so long silent you who are so good as to love me and who know how much pleasure your letters always afford me i therefore rather suspect you may probably have written something too freely concerning public affairs and that your letters may be arrested in your postoffice and yourself lodged in the bastile you see i imagine any thing however extravagant rather than suppose as your letters too often do that my friends forget me i find mr saugrain to answer well the good character you give of him and shall with pleasure render him any services in my power he is now gone down the ohio to reconnoitre that country i should have proceeded in the history  you mention  0  if i could well have avoided accepting the chair of president for this third and last year to which i was again elected by the unanimous voice of the council and general assembly in november if i live to see this year expire i may enjoy some leisure which i promise you to employ in the work you do me the honor to urge so earnestly i sent you with my last a copy of the new constitution proposed for the united states by the late general convention i sent one also to our excellent friend the duke de la rochefoucauld i attended the business of the convention faithfully for four months enclosed you have the last speech i made in it  six states have already adopted the constitution and there is now little doubt of its being accepted by a sufficient number to carry it into execution if not immediately by the whole it has however met with great opposition in some states for we are at present a nation of politicians and though there is a general dread of giving too much power to our governors i think we are more in danger from too little obedience in the governed we shall as you suppose have imposts on trade and customhouses not because other nations have them but because we cannot at present do without them we want to discharge our public debt occasioned by the late war direct taxes are not so easily levied on the scantily settled inhabitants of our wideextended country and what is paid in the price of merchandise is less felt by the consumer and less the cause of complaint when we are out of  0  debt we may leave our trade free for our ordinary charges of government will not be great where there is a free government and the people make their own laws by their representatives i see no injustice in their obliging one another to take their own paper money it is no more so than compelling a man by law to take his own note but it is unjust to pay strangers with such money against their will the making of paper money with such a sanction is however a folly since although you may by law oblige a citizen to take it for his goods you cannot fix his prices and his liberty of rating them as he pleases which is the same thing as settling what value he pleases on your money defeats your sanction i have been concerned to hear of the troubles in the internal government of the country i love  and hope some good may come out of them and that they may end without mischief in your letter to my grandson you asked some questions that had an appearance as if you meditated a visit to us nothing in this world would give me greater pleasure than to receive and embrace here the whole family but it is too great a happiness to be expected this family all join with me in best wishes of every felicity to you and yours and i remain with unalterable and great esteem and affection my dear friend yours most sincerely b franklin   0 william herschel    february      slough near windsor benjamin franklin mccccxcvii from william herschel slough near windsor    february      sir— give me leave to express my thanks to you as president in particular and to all the vicepresidents secretaries and members in general for the honor conferred on me by electing me a member of the american philosophical society held at philadelphia as a small token of my gratitude i send hereby a catalogue of one thousand new nebulæ and clusters of stars and at the same time communicate to the society that on the   th of january      i discovered two satellites revolving round the georgian planet the first in about eight days and three quarters and the second in about twelve and a half the times of the revolution and other circumstances concerning the orbits of these satellites will be determined with greater accuracy hereafter i detected them in consequence of an improvement in my twentyfeet reflector whereby i have gained much light an account of this improvement is mentioned in a note at the end of the catalogue of nebulæ the acquaintance sir i have long had with your literary character makes me seize this opportunity with pleasure of expressing my esteem for you and of begging at the same time that you will render my respects acceptable to all the members of the society i have the honor to be sir your most obedient humble servant william herschel     nevil maskelyne   march      greenwich benjamin franklin mccccxcviii from nevil maskelyne greenwich   march      sir— on the  d of may last year i received from you a paper concerning the variation of the compass by mr churchman of philadelphia of which you desired my opinion as he at the same time sent another similar paper to the board of longitude of which i am a member i did not think i could properly send you my private opinion till that of the board had been taken i have now the pleasure to acknowledge the favor of your letter and to acquaint you that the board of longitude considered it last saturday and agreed it was not new the idea of accounting for the variation having been published in the berlin memoirs for      from two poles not diametrically opposite by the learned mr leonard euler in a mathematical and masterly manner the observations of variation at sea owing to the ironwork in the ship and arms on board are liable to great uncertainty so that differences have been found of six degrees in the english channel there will be a great difference often according as the ship is put on one or the other tack owing to the soft iron on board becoming temporary magnets from the effect of the earth as a great magnet magnetic rocks at sea will disturb the magnet and severe cold in northern regions seems occasionally to render it torpid though it recovers itself again on all these accounts and some others not less important the variation of the compass cannot be     considered as a general method of finding the longitude at sea and is scarce of any use that way now we have so much better methods of attaining the end mr churchmans supposition of a gradual change of the magnetic poles without offering any probable physical hypothesis to account for it must be considered as a mere hypothesis you sir who are so well able to judge of philosophical matters and physical causes will have little doubt to join in opinion with the late dr halley as i do that the gradual change of the magnetic poles cannot be probably accounted for from any gradual changes of the quantity metallic state magnetism or translation of the iron and ironore in the bowels or diffused through the surface of the earth dr halleys hypothesis of four poles two belonging to an outer shell and two to an inner nucleus movable about the axis with a less velocity of rotation than the outer shell is very ingenious and well calculated to get over this difficulty observations both of the variation and dip of the needle made throughout your continent would be of use to throw light on this matter mr churchman might have been well satisfied with the judgments of such able men and good philosophers as mr ewing and mr rittenhouse mr dillwhynn sent me another of his proposals with the disputes between him and the principal mathematicians with you for the royal society which i forwarded there i hope you receive i mean your philosophical society my greenwich observations now published up to the end of      and published annually they     are ordered to you by the council i shall be gratified by the continuance of the present of your memoirs if thought proper and am sensible of the honor of being a member your future correspondence will do honor to us your most humble servant and old friend n maskelyne mccccxcix to the editors of the pennsylvania gazette messrs hall and sellers— i lately heard a remark that on examination of the pennsylvania gazette for fifty years from its commencement it appeared that during that long period scarce one libellous piece had ever appeared in it this generally chaste conduct of your paper is much to its reputation for it has long been the opinion of sober judicious people that nothing is more likely to endanger the liberty of the press than the abuse of that liberty by employing it in personal accusation detraction and calumny the excesses some of our papers have been guilty of in this particular have set this state in a bad light abroad as appears by the following letter which i wish you to publish not merely to show your own disapprobation of the practice but as a caution to others of the profession throughout the united states for i have seen a european newspaper in which the editor who had been charged with frequently calumniating the americans justifies himself by saying that he had     published nothing disgraceful to us which he had not taken from our own printed papers i am etc a b new york march  0      dear friend— my gout has again left me after five months painful confinement it afforded me however the leisure to read or hear read all the packets of your newspapers which you so kindly sent for my amusement mrs w has partaken of it she likes to read the advertisements but she remarks some kind of inconsistency in the announcing so many diversions for almost every evening of the week and such quantities to be sold of expensive superfluities fineries and luxuries just imported in a country that at the same time fills its papers with complaints of hard times and want of money i tell her that such complaints are common to all times and all countries and were made even in solomons time when as we are told silver was as plenty in jerusalem as the stones in the street and yet even then there were people that grumbled so as to incur this censure from that knowing prince say not thou that the former times were better than these for thou dost not inquire rightly concerning that matter but the inconsistency that strikes me the most is that between the name of your city philadelphia brotherly love and the spirit of rancor malice and hatred that breathes in its newspapers for i learn from those papers that your state is divided into parties that each party ascribes all the public operations     of the other to vicious motives that they do not even suspect one another of the smallest degree of honesty that the antifederalists are such merely from the fear of losing power places or emoluments which they have in possession or in expectation that the federalists are a set of conspirators who aim at establishing a tyranny over the persons and property of their countrymen and to live in splendor on the plunder of the people i learn too that your justices of the peace though chosen by their neighbors make a villainous trade of their office and promote discord to augment fees and fleece their electors and that this would not be mended by placing the choice in the executive council who with interested or party views are continually making as improper appointments witness a petty fiddler sycophant and scoundrel appointed judge of the admiralty an old woman and fomenter of sedition to be another of the judges and a jeffries chief justice etc etc with two harpies the comptroller and naval officers to prey upon the merchants and deprive them of their property by force of arms etc i am informed also by these papers that your general assembly though the annual choice of the people shows no regard to their rights but from sinister views or ignorance makes laws in direct violation of the constitution to divest the inhabitants of their property and give it to strangers and intruders and that the council either fearing the resentment of their constituents or plotting to enslave them had projected to disarm them and given orders for that     purpose and finally that your president the unanimous joint choice of the council and assembly is an old rogue who gave his assent to the federal constitution merely to avoid refunding money he had purloined from the united states there is indeed a good deal of manifest inconsistency in all this and yet a stranger seeing in your own prints though he does not believe it all may probably believe enough of it to conclude that pennsylvania is peopled by a set of the most unprincipled wicked rascally and quarrelsome scoundrels upon the face of the globe i have sometimes indeed suspected that those papers are the manufacture of foreign enemies among you who write with a view of disgracing your country and making you appear contemptible and detestable all the world over but then i wonder at the indiscretion of your printers in publishing such writings there is however one of your inconsistencies that consoles me a little which is that though living you give one another the characters of devils dead you are all angels it is delightful when any of you die to read what good husbands good fathers good friends good citizens and good christians you were concluding with a scrap of poetry that places you with certainty every one in heaven so that i think pennsylvania a good country to die in though a very bad one to live in     benjamin franklin    april      philadelphia colas md to mrs colas philadelphia    april      loving cousin— i received some time since a kind letter from you which gave me pleasure as to my going to boston which you seem to wish and i also i begin to doubt its being ever accomplished such a journey at my age would be attended with much inconvenience and hardship and might with the malady i have be dangerous at present i am in my place have all my conveniences and comforts about me and it seems most prudent for me to stay where i am and enjoy them without going abroad to give myself and friends a good deal of trouble which cannot be compensated by our pleasure of meeting since that will be balanced by the pain of parting you need not have made any apology for introducing thayer to me he gave me but little trouble and i had the pleasure of doing him some good though he is rather an insignificant body and has turned to the papists who do not much value the acquisition and i suppose we may easily bear the loss my best wishes attend you being ever your affectionate uncle b franklin benjamin franklin    april      philadelphia brillon mdi to madame brillon  philadelphia    april      my dear dear friend— i received by the last pacquet your kind letter dated in october last i     am glad to hear that you continue well with what is left of the amiable family in whose sweet society i passed so many happy evenings while i lived in passy i sympathize with you in all your losses and afflictions and hope the rest of your life will be as tranquil and free from trouble as it had been for some years before we parted you have given me pleasure by informing me of the welfare and present agreeable circumstances of yourself and children and i am persuaded that your friendship for me will render a similar account of my situation pleasing to you i am in a country where i have the happiness of being universally respected and beloved of which three successive annual elections to the chief magistracy in which elections the representatives of the people in assembly and the supreme council joined and were unanimous is the strongest proof this is a place of profit as well as of honor and my friends cheerfully assist in making the business as easy to me as possible i live in a good house which i built twentyfive years ago contrived to my mind and made still more convenient by an addition since my return a dutiful and affectionate daughter with her husband and six children compose my family the children are all promising and even the youngest who is but four years old contributes to my amusement the eldest benjamin you may remember he has finished his studies at our university and is preparing to enter into business as a printer the original occupation of his grandfather temple who was likewise with me in france is settled about six leagues     from me on his plantation which contains about six hundred acres but when in town he lives with me my rents and incomes are amply sufficient for all my present occasions and if no unexpected misfortunes happen during the little time i have to live i shall leave a handsome estate to be divided among my relatives as to my health it continues the same or rather better than when i left passy but being now in my eightythird year i do not expect to continue much longer a sojourner in this world and begin to promise myself much gratification of my curiosity in soon visiting some other wherever i may hereafter travel be assured my dear friend that if    imperfect benjamin franklin    april      m le veillard mdii to m le veillard    april      my dear friend— i received but a few days since your favor of november  0      in which you continue to urge me to finish the memoirs my three years of service will expire in october when a new president must be chosen and i had the project of retiring then to my grandsons estate in new jersey where i might be free from interruption of visits in order to complete the work for your satisfaction for in this city my time is so cut to pieces by friends and strangers that i have sometimes envied the prisoners in bastile but considering now the little remnant of life i have left the accidents   0 that may happen between this and october and your earnest desire i have come to the resolution to proceed in that work tomorrow and continue it daily till finished which if my health permits may be in the course of the ensuing summer as it goes on i will have a copy made for you and you may expect to receive a part by the next packet it is very possible as you suppose that all the articles of the proposed new government will not remain unchanged after the first meeting of the congress i am of opinion with you that the two chambers were not necessary and i disliked some other articles that are in and wished for some that are not in the proposed plan i nevertheless hope it may be adopted though i shall have nothing to do with the execution of it being determined to quit all public business with my present employment  at eightythree one certainly has a right to ambition repose we are not ignorant that the duties paid at the customhouse on the importation of foreign goods are finally reimbursed by the consumer but we impose them as the easiest way of levying a tax from those consumers if our new country was as closely inhabited as your old one we might without much difficulty collect a landtax that would be sufficient for all purposes but where farms are at five or six miles distance from each other as they are in a great part of our country the going of the collectors from house to house to demand the taxes and being obliged to call more than once for the same tax     makes the trouble of collecting in many cases exceed the value of the sum collected things that are practicable in one country are not always so in another where circumstances differ our duties are however generally so small as to give little temptation to smuggling believe me ever my dear friend yours most affectionately b franklin benjamin franklin    april      philadelphia helvetius mdiii to madame helvetius philadelphia    april      i received and read with the greatest pleasure my dear friend the kind letter you were so good as to write to me with your own hand cest toute à fait charmante it rejoiced me to hear that you continued well with your chères petites étoilles and that you still have your friends about you i often think of the happiness i so long enjoyed in the sweet society of you and them at auteuil when we meet in paradise as i trust we shall the pleasures of that place will be augmented by our recollection of all the circumstances of our acquaintance here below you have made my daughter very happy by the things you sent her they are much admired i continue as well as i have been for some years past and if i live six months longer i may hope for some leisure so as to be able to converse more frequently by letter with my absent friends having absolutely determined to engage no more in any public business after my three years service as president shall expire     m paradise the gentleman who will have the honor of delivering this letter intends to reside some time in paris and acquaints me that he has ordered some cardinals to be frequently sent to him from his estate in virginia and that if any of them get to paris alive you shall be sure to have one he had the pleasure of seeing you formerly with me at passy temple is at his terre busy with his agriculture benjamin presents his respects our best wishes attend you and yours most devoutly i am exceedingly obliged to the good abbés and m cabanis for their letters the guichats and nouvelle cométologie entertained my friends and me very much i cannot write to them now but must say with the debtor in the gospel have patience with me and i will pay you all adieu my very dear friend and believe me ever yours most affectionately b franklin benjamin franklin    may      philadelphia james bowdoin mdiv to james bowdoin read at a meeting of the american philosophical society january       0 philadelphia    may      dear sir— i received your favors by messrs gore hilliard and lee with whose conversation i was much pleased and wished for more of it but their stay with us was too short whenever you recommend any of your friends to me you oblige me i want to know whether your philosophical society      received the second volume of our transactions i sent it but never heard of its arriving if it miscarried i will send another has your society among its books the french work sur les arts et les métiers it is voluminous well executed and may be useful in our country i have bequeathed it them in my will but if they have it already i will substitute something else our ancient correspondence used to have something philosophical in it as you are now more free from public cares and i expect to be so in a few months why may we not resume that kind of correspondence our much regretted friend winthrop once made me the compliment that i was good at starting game for philosophers let me try if i can start a little for you has the question how came the earth by its magnetism ever been considered is it likely that iron ore immediately existed when this globe was first formed or may it not rather be supposed a gradual production of time if the earth is at present magnetical in virtue of the masses of iron ore contained in it might not some ages pass before it had magnetic polarity since iron ore may exist without that polarity and by being placed in certain circumstances may obtain it from an external cause is it not possible that the earth received its magnetism from some such cause in short may not a magnetic power exist throughout our system perhaps through all systems so that if men could make a voyage in the starry regions a     compass might be of use and may not such universal magnetism with its uniform direction be serviceable in keeping the diurnal revolution of a planet more steady to the same axis lastly as the poles of magnets may be changed by the presence of stronger magnets might not in ancient times the near passing of some large comet of greater magnetic power than this globe of ours have been a means of changing its poles and thereby wrecking and deranging its surface placing in different regions the effect of centrifugal force so as to raise the waters of the sea in some while they were depressed in others let me add another question or two not relating indeed to magnetism but however to the theory of the earth is not the finding of great quantities of shells and bones of animals natural to hot climates in the cold ones of our present world some proof that its poles have been changed is not the supposition that the poles have been changed the easiest way of accounting for the deluge by getting rid of the old difficulty how to dispose of its waters after it was over since if the poles were again to be changed and placed in the present equator the sea would fall there about fifteen miles in height and rise as much in the present polar regions and the effect would be proportionable if the new poles were placed anywhere between the present and the equator does not the apparent wreck of the surface of this globe thrown up into long ridges of mountains with strata in various positions make it probable that its     internal mass is a fluid but a fluid so dense as to float the heaviest of our substances do we know the limit of condensation air is capable of supposing it to grow denser within the surface in the same proportion nearly as it does without at what depth may it be equal in density with gold can we easily conceive how the strata of the earth could have been so deranged if it had not been a mere shell supported by a heavier fluid would not such a supposed internal fluid globe be immediately sensible of a change in the situation of the earths axis alter its form and thereby burst the shell and throw up parts of it above the rest as if we would alter the position of the fluid contained in the shell of an egg and place its longest diameter where the shortest now is the shell must break but would be much harder to break if the whole internal substance were as solid and hard as the shell might not a wave by any means raised in this supposed internal ocean of extremely dense fluid raise in some degree as it passes the present shell of incumbent earth and break it in some places as in earthquakes and may not the progress of such wave and the disorders it occasions among the solids of the shell account for the rumbling sound being first heard at a distance augmenting as it approaches and gradually dying away as it proceeds a circumstance observed by the inhabitants of south america in their last great earthquake that noise coming from a place some degrees north of lima and being traced by inquiry quite down to buenos ayres proceeded regularly from north to south at     the rate of —— leagues per minute as i was informed by a very ingenious peruvian whom i met with at paris b franklin mdv description of the process to be observed in making large sheets of paper in the chinese manner with one smooth surface in europe to have a large surface of paper connected together and smooth on one side the following operations are performed   a number of small sheets are to be made separately   these are to be couched one by one between blankets   when a heap is formed it must be put under a strong press to force out the water   then the blankets are to be taken away one by one and the sheets hung up to dry   when dry they are to be again pressed or if to be sized they must be dipped into size made of warm water in which glue and alum are dissolved   they must then be pressed again to force out the superfluous size   they must then be hung up a second time to dry which if the air happens to be damp requires some days   they must then be taken down laid together and again pressed   they must be pasted together at their edges      0 the whole must be glazed by labor with a flint in china if they would make sheets suppose of four and a half ells long and one and a half ells wide they have two large vats each five ells long and two ells wide made of brick lined with a plaster that holds water in these the stuff is mixed ready to work between these vats is built a kiln or stove with two inclining sides each side something larger than the sheet of paper they are covered with a fine stucco that takes a polish and are so contrived as to be well heated by a small fire circulating in the walls the mould is made with thin but deep sides that it may be both light and stiff it is suspended at each end with cords that pass over pulleys fastened to the ceiling their ends connected with a counterpoise nearly equal the weight of the mould two men one at each end of the mould lifting it out of the water by the help of the counterpoise turn it and apply it with the stuff to the smooth surface of the stove against which they press it to force out great part of the water through the wires the heat of the wall soon evaporates the rest and a boy takes off the dried sheet by rolling it up the side next the stove receives the even polish of the stucco and is thereby better fitted to receive the impression of fine prints if a degree of sizing is required a decoction of rice is mixed with the stuff in the vat thus the great sheet is obtained smooth and sized and a number of the european operations saved     as the stove has two polished sides and there are two vats the same operation is at the same time performed by two other men at the other vat and one fire serves benjamin franklin    may      philadelphia john lathrop mdvi to john lathrop  philadelphia    may      reverend sir— i received your obliging favor of the  th instant by mr hilliard with whose conversation i was much pleased and would have been glad to have had more of it if he would have spared it to me but the short time of his stay has prevented you need make no apology for introducing any of your friends to me i consider it as doing me honor as well as giving me pleasure i thank you for the pamphlet of the humane society in return please to accept one of the same kind which was published while i resided in france if your society has not hitherto seen it it may possibly afford them useful hints it would certainly as you observe be a very great pleasure to me if i could once again visit my native town and walk over the grounds i used to frequent when a boy and where i enjoyed many of the innocent pleasures of youth which would be so brought to my remembrance and where i might find some of my old acquaintance to converse with but when i consider how well i am situated here with every     thing about me that i can call either necessary or convenient the fatigues and bad accommodations to be met with and suffered in a land journey and the unpleasantness of sea voyages to one who although he has crossed the atlantic eight times and made many smaller trips does not recollect his having ever been at sea without taking a firm resolution never to go to sea again and that if i were arrived in boston i should see but little of it as i could neither bear walking nor riding in a carriage over its pebbled streets and above all that i should find very few indeed of my old friends living it being now sixtyfive years since i left it to settle here—all this considered i say it seems probable though not certain that i shall hardly again visit that beloved place but i enjoy the company and conversation of its inhabitants when any of them are so good as to visit me for besides their general goodsense which i value the boston manner turn of phrase and even tone of voice and accent in pronunciation all please and seem to refresh and revive me i have been long impressed with the same sentiments you so well express of the growing felicity of mankind from the improvements in philosophy morals politics and even the conveniences of common living and the invention and acquisition of new and useful utensils and instruments so that i have sometimes almost wished it had been my destiny to be born two or three centuries hence for invention and improvement are prolific and beget more of their kind the present progress is rapid many of great importance now unthought of will before that   0 period be produced and then i might not only enjoy their advantages but have my curiosity gratified in knowing what they are to be i see a little absurdity in what i have just written but it is to a friend who will wink and let it pass while i mention one reason more for such a wish which is that if the art of physic shall be improved in proportion to other arts we may then be able to avoid diseases and live as long as the patriarchs in genesis to which i suppose we should have little objection i am glad my dear sister has so good and kind a neighbor i sometimes suspect she may be backward in acquainting me with circumstances in which i might be more useful to her if any such occur to your observation your mentioning them to me will be a favor i shall be thankful for with great esteem i have the honor to be reverend sir etc b franklin benjamin franklin   june      philadelphia m le veillard mdvii to m le veillard philadelphia   june      my dear friend— i received a few days ago your kind letter of the  d of january the arrêt in favor of the noncatholiques gives pleasure here not only from its present advantages but as it is a good step towards general toleration and to the abolishing in time all party spirit among christians and the mischiefs that have so long attended it thank god the world is growing wiser and wiser and as     by degrees men are convinced of the folly of wars for religion for dominion or for commerce they will be happier and happier eight states have now agreed to the proposed new constitution there remain five who have not yet discussed it their appointed times of meeting not being yet arrived two are to meet this month the rest later one more agreeing it will be carried into execution probably some will not agree at present but time may bring them in so that we have little doubt of its becoming general perhaps with some corrections as to your friends taking a share in the management of it his age and infirmities render him unfit for the business as the business would be for him after the expiration of his presidentship which will now be in a few months he is determined to engage no more in public affairs even if required but his countrymen will be too reasonable to require it you are not so considerate you are a hard taskmaster you insist on his writing his life already a long work and at the same time would have him continually employed in augmenting the subject while the time shortens in which the work is to be executed general washington is the man that all our eyes are fixed on for president and what little influence i may have is devoted to him i am etc b franklin     benjamin franklin   june      philadelphia m dupont de nemours mdviii to m dupont de nemours philadelphia   june      sir— i have received your favor of december   st with the extract of a letter which you wish to have translated and published here but seven states having before it arrived ratified the new constitution and others being daily expected to do the same after the fullest discussion in convention and in all the public papers till everybody was tired of the argument it seemed too late to propose delay and especially the delay that must be occasioned by a revision and correction of all the separate constitutions for it would take at least a year to convince thirteen states that the constitutions they have practised ever since the revolution without observing any imperfections in them so great as to be worth the trouble of amendment are nevertheless so ill formed as to be unfit for continuation or to be parts of a federal government and when they should be so convinced it would probably take some years more to make the corrections an eighth state has since acceded and when a ninth is added which is now daily expected the constitution will be carried into execution it is probable however that at the first meeting of the new congress various amendments will be proposed and discussed when i hope your ouvrage sur les principes et le bien des républiques en générale etc etc may be ready to put into their hands and such a work from your hand i am confident though it may     not be entirely followed will afford useful hints and produce advantages of importance but we must not expect that a new government may be formed as a game of chess may be played by a skilful hand without a fault the players of our game are so many their ideas so different their prejudices so strong and so various and their particular interests independent of the general seeming so opposite that not a move can be made that is not contested the numerous objections confound the understanding the wisest must agree to some unreasonable things that reasonable ones of more consequence may be obtained and thus chance has its share in many of the determinations so that the play is more like trictrac with a box of dice we are much pleased with the disposition of your government to favor our commerce manifested in the late réglement you appear to be possessed of a truth which few governments are possessed of that a must take some of bs produce otherwise b will not be able to pay for what he would take of a but there is one thing wanting to facilitate and augment our intercourse it is a dictionary explaining the names of different articles of manufacture in the two languages when i was in paris i received a large order for a great variety of goods particularly of the kind called hard wares—that is wares of iron and steel and when i showed the invoice to your manufacturers they did not understand what kind of goods or instruments were meant by the names nor could any english and french dictionary be found to explain them so i sent to england for one of each     sort which might serve both as explanation and as a model the latter being of importance likewise since people are prejudiced in favor of forms they have been used to though perhaps not the best they cost me twentyfive guineas but were lost by the way and the peace coming on the scheme dropped it would however as i imagine be well worth reviving for our merchants say we will send to england for such goods as we want because there they understand our orders and can execute them precisely with great and sincere esteem i am etc b franklin m de condorcet   july      paris benjamin franklin mdix from m de condorcet paris   july      my dear friend— i beg you to assure the philosophical society of philadelphia of my gratitude for the honor which it has done me in electing me a member and to present at the same time my thanks for the volume it has been kind enough to send me i have seen your new federal constitution and the speech pronounced by you on that occasion if it was necessary to finish it at once if it was impossible to obtain any thing better we must regard it as among the necessary evils and hope that the opposition will be strong enough to require a few years hence a new convention i see with pain that the aristocratic spirit seeks to introduce itself among     you in spite of so many wise precautions at this moment it is throwing every thing into confusion here priests magistrates nobles all unite against the poor citizens who are of a different character this league so numerous in itself has increased its strength by clamors against despotism it is true that it has taken the very moment when the king is acknowledging the rights of the nation and promising to restore them but the word is a hateful one and in this country words are more than things i hope however that we shall get through and that we shall have neither civil war nor bankruptcy in spite of all that our pretended patriots are saying and doing to lead us to both adieu my dear friend may you long enjoy your glory but let it not make you forget the friends and the admirers whom you have left on the other side of the ocean i am etc condorcet duke de la rochefoucauld    july      varennes benjamin franklin mdx from the duke de la rochefoucauld varennes    july      my dear friend— i have heard from you indirectly through m le veillard and the abbé de la roche more recently than by the letter which you were kind enough to write to me some time since i learn from the former gentleman that we may soon expect the memoirs of your life which you promised him so long ago what a precious monument this     memoir must be written as it is by a true philosopher whose genius has thrown light upon physical and political science has taught us what lightning is and how we may avoid it what liberty is and how we may acquire and preserve it and who uniting to rich intellectual gifts the kindest social feelings has shown that he knows the value of friendship and how compatible it is with sentiments of respect and veneration a philosopher too who can judge himself with the same impartiality with which he would judge others it will be a gift most dear to your friends who will always pray that the last chapter of a life so valuable to humanity may have the longest possible extent we see with pleasure that your infirmities though they do not leave you still do not increase and since they have allowed you for the last three years to labor in public affairs we hope that they will now allow you to enjoy for a long period the repose and tranquillity which should close so great a career eight states then have accepted the new federal constitution virginia is to be the ninth so that it will presently go into operation with a few modifications made upon the original plan adopted by the convention there is one point on which i have heard no objections which yet seems to me liable to a great many i mean the extent of the power granted to the president and the possibility of his occupying the place for an indefinite period i love to believe that washington your worthy companion in the great american revolution will give to the world the example of a man who has willingly set     bounds to his own power that when placed by his fellowcitizens in the highest office he will point out to them the evils of too blind a confidence and directing it to a noble end he will provide proper restraints upon his own power and that of his successors less worthy than himself while you are busy in these great matters france whom you left talking zealously of liberty for other nations begins to think that a small portion of this same liberty would be a very good thing for herself good works for the last thirty years and your good example for the last fourteen have enlightened us much while our ministers sometimes despotic and sometimes rapacious have by their attacks upon personal liberty or property led men to the examination of great principles an ignorance of which sometimes real and sometimes conventional left us in a state of calm which was by no means happiness though frivolous unenlightened and stupid people who are the largest class thought it was the excess of the evil awakened us at last m de calonne made known the disastrous state of the finances his successors employed violent means the classes which had been the zealous supporters of the royal authority and often the passive or the ready instruments of ministerial despotism for which when they opposed it they only substituted their own which was still worse—these classes found their only means of resistance consisted in calling public opinion to their aid they have made an appeal to the nation and the statesgeneral are demanded with one voice from one extremity of france     to the other the ministers instead of skilfully yielding to this call have shown a repugnance and defer announcing their convocation pretending that it is difficult to settle the forms and that before the assembly can be called time should be given for the public mind to grow calm this last reason is altogether futile for the more repugnance they show and the stronger their desire to avoid granting the general wish the more it is to be feared that the exasperation will increase the first reason however is not without foundation it is true that the form of our statesgeneral which has undergone several variations is very nearly determined by the different meetings which have taken place from      to      but their constitution is a bad one the distinction into three orders of which the first the clergy ought not to be one of which the second the nobility is a constitutional evil and enjoys with the first privileges which are burdensome to the nation of which the third the third estate which ought to be the only one and should comprehend all holders of property is still in a great measure composed of privileged persons i repeat this distinction into three orders is a great obstacle to the public good by the diversity of interests which may render this assembly a system of three bodies inimicable to each other and no one of them truly friends to the nation if our wellintentioned ministers had taken up the idea of convoking a national assembly they might have reformed this evil and given us a form of representation founded upon principles of justice and good     policy but now that they call it in spite of themselves they cannot help following the old form and it is from an assembly the composition of which is so exceptionable that we are to expect a constitution the light which has lately been shed upon the science of political economy is our only ground of hope and consolation and perhaps it will be sufficient to triumph over ministers orders and political bodies over their passions and their prejudices posterity must judge of this but i much fear that our first steps in the career of liberty will not be guided by that sound reason which alone can lead us promptly and permanently to happiness you americans were in a far more favorable position for the establishment of a good constitution you had none of those distinctions of birth and place with which superstition and the feudal system have cursed old europe it was partly to avoid the evil influence of these prejudices that your forefathers left their country and sought a retreat in the forests of america which they soon converted into fertile fields they had imbibed with the milk of their british mothers the love and the principles of liberty which sometimes forgotten by that nation have never been extinct among them and these principles and this love had taken deep root in the hearts of your countrymen when the ministers and parliament of england attempted to enslave you they were resisted with an energy which they had never expected and when you had acquired a rank among nations you took for the basis of your government and of your laws personal   0 liberty liberty of property and consequently of trade and religious liberty you allowed men to enjoy all the rights which they hold from nature and of which everywhere else either legislators or circumstances have more or less deprived them but the pleasure of conversing with you has carried me beyond the proper limits of a letter if i did not know your indulgence i should ask your pardon but your friendship and the interest of the subject make me feel this to be unnecessary give your distant blessing to a nation which at least has the merit of appreciating your worth and which by the enlightened men it has produced is worthy that you should take an interest in its fate though it has often been the last to profit by the lessons which it has given to others i shall close my letter by offering you on the part of the author and on mine a dissertation on nyctalopia a disease endemic in the neighborhood of la rocheguyon you will find there the names of m de condorcet and the abbé rochon who desire to add their affectionate compliments to those of all my family

other gentlemen of chambersburgh philadelphia  0 september      gentlemen— i received the letter you did me the honor of writing to me respecting what was supposed a new invention the blowing of furnaces by a fall of water when mr zantzinger delivered me your letter i told him that i had several books in my library which described the same contrivance and i have since shown them to him they are the french encyclopedia or dictionary of arts and sciences swedenborgs latin treatise of iron works and the french work des arts et des métiers in the article of forges those descriptions are all accompanied with figures in copper plate which demonstrate the invention to be the same precisely in all its essential parts and in the accounts of it it is said to have been first practised in italy about one hundred years since whence it was brought into france where it is now much used thence into sweden and germany and i remember to have been informed by a spaniard who was here forty years ago and gave me a drawing of it that it was practised in some parts of mexico in their furnaces for smelting their silver ore this being the case you see gentlemen that mr mcclintock cannot properly be recommended to the assembly as the discoverer of something new it is however not an uncommon thing for ingenious men in different ages as well as in different countries to hit upon the same contrivance     without knowing or having heard what has been done by others and mr mcclintock has at least the merit of having introduced the knowledge of this useful invention into this part of america and of demonstrating by his own example its practicability i am gentlemen with great regard your most obedient and most humble servant b franklin charlotte filangieri    september      naples

patrimony than the memory of his virtues and his reputation if the letter which you wrote to him on the   th of october      had reached him before the  st of july the day on which the disease attacked him he would not have failed to answer it and to send you the copies of his work on legislation which you had requested i shall myself perform what would have been his wish and you will receive through the channel which you pointed out to him all that you desire the little that remains of his immortal work will shortly be printed and i shall deem it a duty to send it to you as soon     as it comes from the press i shall also have the melancholy pleasure of sending you at the same time the history of his life and a selection from the best of his writings accept sir the assurance of

mdxiii to the duke de la rochefoucauld philadelphia    october      —— our public affairs begin to wear a more quiet aspect the disputes about the faults of the new constitution are subsided the first congress will probably mend the principal ones and future congresses the rest that which you mentioned did not pass unnoticed in the convention many if i remember right were for making the president incapable of being chosen after the first four years but the majority were for leaving the electors free to choose whom they pleased and it was alleged that such incapacity might tend to make the president less attentive to the duties of his office and to the interests of the people than he would be if a second choice     depended on their good opinion of him we are making experiments in politics what knowledge we shall gain by them will be more certain though perhaps we may hazard too much in that mode of acquiring it having now finished my turn of being president and promising myself to engage no more in public business i hope to enjoy the small remains of life that are allowed me in the repose i have so long wished for i purpose to employ it in completing the personal history you mention  it is now brought down to my fiftieth year what is to follow will be of more important transactions but it seems to me what is done will be of more general use to young readers exemplifying strongly the effects of prudent and imprudent conduct in the commencement of a life of business b franklin benjamin franklin    october      philadelphia lavoisier mdxiv to madame

of the portrait which she has herself done me the honor to make of me it is allowed by those who have seen it to have great merit as a picture in every respect but what particularly endears     it to me is the hand that drew it our english enemies when they were in possession of this city and my house made a prisoner of my portrait and carried it off with them leaving that of its companion my wife by itself a kind of widow you have replaced the husband and the lady seems to smile as well pleased it is true as you observe that i enjoy here every thing that a reasonable mind can desire a sufficiency of income a comfortable habitation of my own building having all the conveniences i could imagine a dutiful and affectionate daughter to nurse and take care of me a number of promising grandchildren some old friends still remaining to converse with and more respect distinction and public honors than i can possibly merit these are the blessings of god and depend on his continued goodness yet all do not make me forget paris and the nine years happiness i enjoyed there in the sweet society of a people whose conversation is instructive whose manners are highly pleasing and who above all the nations of the world have in the greatest perfection the art of making themselves beloved by strangers and now even in my sleep i find that the scenes of all my pleasant dreams are laid in that city or in its neighborhood i like much young m dupont he appears a very sensible and valuable man and i think his father will have a great deal of satisfaction in him please to present my thanks to m lavoisier for the nomenclature chimique he has been so good as to send me it must be a very useful book and assure     him of my great and sincere esteem and attachment my best wishes

end of volume xi   this paper on the criminal laws and the practice of privateering was written in the form of a letter to vaughan it first appeared anonymously in a small volume published by sir

of the laws comes from the impunity of crimes and not from the moderation of the penalties—editor   this offer having been accepted by the late king of prussia a treaty of amity and commerce was concluded between that monarch and the united states containing the following humane philanthropic article in the formation of which dr franklin as one of the american plenipotentiaries was principally concerned viz article xxiii if war should arise between the two contracting parties the merchants of either country then residing in the other shall be allowed to remain nine months to collect their debts and settle their affairs and may depart freely carrying off all their effects without molestation or hindrance and all women and children scholars of every faculty cultivators of the earth artisans manufacturers and fishermen unarmed and inhabiting unfortified towns villages or places and in general all others whose occupations are for the common subsistence and benefit of mankind shall be allowed to continue their respective employments and shall not be molested in their persons nor shall their houses and goods be burnt or otherwise destroyed nor their fields wasted by the armed force of the enemy in whose power by the events of war they may happen to fall but if any thing is necessary to be taken from them for the use of such armed force the same shall be paid for at a reasonable price and all merchants and trading vessels employed in exchanging the products of different places and thereby rendering the necessaries conveniences and comforts of human life more easy to be obtained and more general shall be allowed to pass free and unmolested and neither of the contracting powers shall grant or issue any commission to any private armed vessels empowering them

influence in determining him to accept the invitation given him by franklin and jefferson to go to america and execute a statue of washington he accompanied franklin whose bust he had recently

september           the cardinal de rohan   the first part of the memoirs of his life written in england dr franklin had communicated to m le veillard   franklin knew the french language passably well but he never acquired a very great facility either in writing or speaking it he learned it as early as      so that he could read it a little but when he visited france in      and      though he was already a celebrity in paris and brought letters to madame geoffrin from david hume he did not find himself adequately equipped with french for circulating in paris society he lost no time when he took up his residence in france in repairing this deficiency as well as possible at his then advanced age and he succeeded marvellously in that as in every thing to which he applied his mind but there is a story told at the expense of his french which is no doubt good testimony upon this point merely because it was current whether authentic or not and there is no reason that i know of to question its authenticity at a session of the french academy finding it difficult to follow the exercises and wishing to appear no less appreciative than the rest of the audience he said that he should applaud

convention—editor   to the original draft of this speech there is the following note appended in the handwriting of dr franklin the convention except three or four persons thought prayer unnecessary

to thos s grimké jan        montpelier thos s grimké montpelier jan           you wish to be informed of the errors in your pamphlet alluded to in my last the first related to the proposition of dr franklin in favor of a religious service in the federal convention the proposition was recd and treated with the respect due to it but the lapse of time which had preceded with considerations growing out of it had the effect of limiting what was done to a reference of the proposition to a highly respectable committee this issue of it may be traced in the printed journal the quaker usage never discontinued in the state and the place where the convention held its sittings might not have been without an influence as might also the discord of religious opinions within the convention as well as among the clergy of the spot the error into which you had fallen may have been confirmed by a communication in the national intelligencer some years ago said to have been received through a respectable channel from a member of the convention that the communication was erroneous is certain whether from misapprehension or misrecollection uncertain—writings of madison vol iv     in the

his will we shall i am afraid be disgraced through little party views i move that we have prayers every morning adjourned till tomorrow morning the time which had elapsed without prayers in the convention sufficiently explains the failure of franklins motion it will not be amiss here to recall the fact that the delegates chosen to form a state constitution for pennsylvania were required to
