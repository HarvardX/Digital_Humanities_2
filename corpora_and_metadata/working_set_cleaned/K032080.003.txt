though it is found at this time in vast abundance in several parts of the country it is not an indigenous kind by whom it was first introduced is uncertain pennant mentions sir kenelm digby and da costa speaks of charles howard esquire of the arundel family its history as related by da costa is so very interesting that we shall give it in the words of its author   it is the largest species of land snail in england and is found in hedges and woods it closes its shell carefully against winter with a white thick cover or operculum dull and like plaster and in the closed state it remains till the beginning of april or warm weather at which time it loosens the border of the cover and the animal creeps out of the shell for its necessary occasions dr lister informs us he kept one in his bosom about the beginning of march when the animal feeling the warmth in a few hours disengaged its cover and crept out  the animal being large fleshy and not of an unpleasant taste has been used for food in ancient times it was a favorite dish with the romans who had their cochlearia or snail stews wherein they bred and fattened them pliny tells us that the first inventor of this luxury was a fulvius harpinus a little before the civil wars between caesar and pompey varro has handed down to us a description of the stews and manner of making them he says open places were chose surrounded by water that the snails might not abandon them and care was taken that the places were not much exposed to the sun or to the dews the artificial stews were generally made under rocks or eminences whose bottoms were watered by lakes or rivers and if a natural dew or moisture was not found they formed an artificial one by bringing a pipe to it bored full of holes like a watering pot by which the place was continually sprinkled or moistened the snails required little attention or food for as they crawled they found it on the floor or area and on the walls or sides if not hindered by the surrounding water they were fed with bran and sodden lees of wines or like substances and a few laurel leaves were thrown on it  pliny tells us there were many sorts as the whitish from umbria the large sort from dalmatia and the african etc this particular kind seems to be that he mentions l   c    they propagate very much and their spawn is very minute  varro is scarcely to be credited when he says some would grow so large that their shells held ten quarts  they were also fed and fattened in large pots or pans stuck full of holes to let in the air and lined with bran and sodden lees or vegetables  they are yet used as food in several parts of europe more especially during lent and are preserved in stews or escargotoires now a large place boarded in and the floor covered with herbs wherein they nestle and feed  in italy in many places they are sold in the markets and are called bacoli martinacci and gallinelle in many provinces of france as narbonne franche comte etc and even in paris they boil them says lister in river water and seasoning them with salt pepper and oil make a hearty repast  this is not indigenous or originally a native of these kingdoms but a naturalized species that has throve so well as now to be found in very great quantities it was first imported to us from italy about the middle of last century by a scavoir vivre or epicure as an article of food mr aubrey informs us it was a charles howard esquire of the arundel family who on that account scattered and dispersed those snails all over the downs and in the woods etc at albury an ancient seat of that noble family near ashted boxhill dorking and ebbisham or epsom in surrey where they have thriven so much that all that part of the county even to the confines of sussex abounds with them insomuch that they are a nuisance and far surpass in number the common or any other species of english snails  the epicures or scavoir vivre of those days followed this luxurious folly and the snails were scattered or dispersed throughout the kingdom but not with equal success neither have records transmitted to posterity the fame of those worthies equal to the roman fulvius harpinus except of two the one sir kenelm digby who dispersed them about gothurst the seat of that family now of the wrights near newport pagnel in buckinghamshire where probably they did not thrive much as they were not frequent thereabout the other worthy was a lord hatton recorded by mr morton who scattered them in the coppices at his seat at kirby in northamptonshire where they did not succeed  dr lister found them about puckeridge and ware in hertfordshire and observes they are abundant in the southern parts but are not found in the northern parts of this island  in surry as before mentioned they abound in several other counties they are not uncommon as in oxfordshire especially about woodstock and bladen in gloucestershire in chedworth parish and about frog mill in dorsetshire etc but i have never heard that

different parts of the kingdom the conchologist will perhaps be surprised at the small number we shall venture to admit as distinct species the varieties of those shells seem endless and it may be doubred whether they are not in general indebted to age accident or the peculiar qualities of the waters they inhabit for those variations in general appearance that have been too frequently mistaken for characteristic differences of species  as the myae will fall under consideration more fully hereafter we shall for the present confine our remarks to the shell before us and its very analogous kind the mya ovata of dr solander  this has been considered by some as a mere variety of ovata and we confess our opinion is still wavering in assigning it a name and character as a new species the mya ovata has been lately found in the river froome in somersetshire and likewise in the new river near london what are usually deemed its varieties are numerous but none of them can we believe be considered as distinct species except the present which is certainly the most remote of any if it is really a variety of that species the mya ovata in all its gradations seems somewhat more ventricose and ovate in its contour than this shell and though the variations of the latter are considerable we have generally observed a slight depression across the middle which causes the narrowest end to be rather flattened throughout and it is also rather more cunciform or wedgeshaped at this end than mya ovata to this we might perhaps add with some propriety that the gaping beyond the hinge at the broadest end is wider than in mya ovata  whether this difference is actually sufficient of form a distinct specific character and whether it is constant in other shells of this kind still remains in some degree of uncertainty both this and the mya ovata inhabit the same waters for we have seen several specimens from the river froome where it is known the mya ovata is also found and as to color it is no criterion both kinds are greenish radiated with yellow and are more or less vivid in different shells they are seldom higher in color than the specimen we have figured some are more of an olive color and others are deeply tinged with brown   plate cii turbo fontinalis generic character animal limax univalve spiral or of a taper form aperture somewhat compressed orbicular entire  specific
