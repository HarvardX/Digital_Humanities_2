prophecies of isaiah in two octavo volumes of which the first was published in      and the second in      these lectures are perfectly orthodox but perhaps too much of a popular complexion  macdonald

style of ossian with a crude species of humor mr macdonald has also written the independent a novel in two duodecimo volumes and velina a poetical fragment published in       macdonald thomas esquire

published in    0 and the fourth in      this publication though certainly not without the merit of utility cannot on many accounts be said to entitle mr macfarlan to firstrate distinction as an historian we believe this gentleman formerly attempted a translation of ossians poems into latin hexameters of which he published the first book of temora by way of specimen in      those who are acquainted with the characteristic genius and style of ossian as well as with those of the roman classics will wonder at such an undertaking the specimen produced upon this occasion was a very indifferent one  macfarlan rev john ddf rss a clergyman of the church of scotland he has been for some time one of the ministers of canongate edinburgh and has written a defense of the clergy of the church of scotland who appeared in opposition to the intention of an unlimited repeal of the penal laws against roman catholics an octavo volume of inquiries concerning the poor published in      and tracts on subjects of national importance published three years afterward  macgregor john a teacher of the mathematics in edinburgh and author of a complete treatise on practical mathematics an octavo

the articles navigation parallax pendulum projection of the sphere shipbuilding and naval tactics in the encyclopaedia britannica and is about to present the world with a treatise on the theory and practice of navigation and another in three volumes on the theory and practice of astronomy  mackenzie henry esquire a native of scotland and a gentleman whose elegance as a writer have justly entitled him to the name of the addison of the north the first character which he assumed as an author was that of a sentimental and pathetic writer in which he met with considerable success the man of feeling a novel his first publication made its appearance in      and was very favorably received in the same year he published the pursuits of happiness a poem and two years afterward the man of the world a novel in two duodecimo volumes the novel of julia de rubigne in two volumes duodecimo is also we believe to be attributed to his pen in the dramatic line of composition he has produced the prince of tunis a tragedy acted at edinburgh in      and we believe he altered the fatal curiosity of lillo as it was represented at the hay market theater mr mackenzie edited in      a quarto volume of poems by the late rev dr thomas blacklock together with an essay on the education of the blind to which he prefixed a most interesting and elegant account of the authors life and writings he announced at the same time the intended publication of some sermons and other prose works by dr blacklock which we belive have not yet appeared in the year      when a society of literary gentlemen at edinburgh came to the resolution of publishing a periodical paper mr mackenzie then of the exchequer in that city was entrusted with the conduct of the work his numerous papers in the mirror the first production of that society have been particularly distinguished for their elegance and neatness to the lounger a periodical paper afterward published by the same society he likewise contributed some very distinguished essays indeed we are of opinion that without the attraction of mr mackenzies performances neither of these publications would have ranked very highly in the class of periodical papers but possessed of these they may boast a saving principle and a sterling excellence in their conformation which gives them a durable value and will insure them a lasting estimation among the works of taste the following is a sentence which was passed upon mr mackenzie by a reviewer of the day upon the appearance of his man of feeling  it is probably a first work and from the specimen it affords of the talents of its author we should not be disposed to think that he will ever attain to any great eminence in literature he may amuse himself at the foot of parnassus but to ascend the steeps of the mountain must be the task of those on whom their benignant stars have bestowed the rare gifts of true genius     mackenzie roderick esquire an officer of a character no less honorable in the literary than in the military world he published in      strictures on lieutenant colonel tarletons history of the campaigns in north america in    0 and      mr mackenzie was personally concerned as well as col tarleton in some of the most considerable actions of these campaigns and he animadverts with the greatest severity upon the colonels history his publication seems to have been undertaken from a motive of great generosity and friendly zeal viz to vindicate the fame of lord cornwallis whose military conduct had suffered certain disrepectful insinuations from colonel tarleton and whose distance from home deprived him of an opportunity of defending himself mr mackenzie has since that time published a sketch of the war with tippoo sultaun in two quarto volumes which were printed at calcutta in      and      this work contains much excellent and circumstantial information related in a strain of impartiality and in an honest unassuming manner which cannot fail to gratify every reader  mackenzie anna maria this lady has produced several novels at the leadenhallstreet press dedicated to the goddess of wisdom among them are monmouth danish massacre mysteries elucidated and the neapolitan they are frequently voluminous and sometimes of a species somewhat superior to the generality of the fungous productions of that literary hotbed  mackintosh james esquire this gentleman published in      vindiciae gallicae a defense of the french revolution and its english admirers against the accusations of mr burke which has been almost universally allowed to be one of the best written pamphlets ever produced in our language we believe mr mackintosh is also the author of two octavo volumes of travels in europe asia and africa published anonimously in      they consist of a series of familiar wellwritten letters abounding in oriental politics and are particularly severe upon governor hastings they gave offense to some of our east indian nabobs and were answered in a strain of welsh asperity by captain joseph price who had complained of personal illtreatment from mr francis and who now attributed these travels to an agent employed by him to traduce the character of governor hastings  macknight rev james dd an eminent clergyman of the church of scotland who is celebrated for his learned and useful labors in illustration and defense of the new testament he published in      his celebrated harmony of the four gospels in a quarto volume and in      the truth of the gospel history showed in a quarto volume both of these works have experienced the success to which such laborious and masterly performances are entitled in      dr macknight published in quarto a new literal translation from the original greek of the apostle pauls first and second epistles to the thessalonians which was intended as a specimen of a literal translation of all the apostolic epistles with commentaries notes and essays about which he had for many years been employed this complete work did not make its appearance till      when it was published in four volumes quarto and added a new laurel to the brow of this respectable veteran in biblical literature  maclaine rev archibald dd a native of scotland and late minister of the english church at the hague he published so long ago as the year      a single sermon on the death of the prince of orange in      his masterly translation of mosheims ecclesiastical history made its first appearance in two volumes quarto it experienced a most favorable reception and was soon reprinted in six volumes octavo which is the form in which all the subsequent editions have been published a supplement to the quarto edition containing the corrections additional notes and dissertations which had been added to the octavo edition was published by dr maclaine in quarto in      few publications upon their first appearance have been more generally read than mr soame jenyns view of the internal evidence of christianity upon the occasion of this publication dr maclaine addressed a series of letters to that gentleman published in a duodecimo volume in      these letters were written to serve the best purposes of christianity upon a due consideration of the distinguished eminence of mr jenyns as a writer of the singular mixture of piety wit error wisdom and paradox exhibited in his publication and of his defense of christianity upon principles which would lead men to enthusiasm or to skepticism according to their different dispositions his only publications since this time have been two fast sermons preached in      and       macleod hugh dd professor of history in the university of glasgow and author of casus principis or an essay toward a history of the principality of scotland

of which had appeared before singly these discourses and the elegant prefixed dissertation on that species of composition have been highly admired as polished specimens in their kind and place the genius and judgment of their author in a most respectable point of view mr mainwaring has also published a few occasional single sermons since the above date and was engaged in a controversy with the late bishop hallifax about the proper way of quoting passages of scripture  maitland james earl of lauderdale in the kingdom of scotland this nobleman although an eyewitness to the horrors which attended the popular commotions in france has persevered in avowing himself the champion of democracy he published in      letters to the peers of scotland in an octavo volume a work too much of an

of shakspeare in ten crown octavo volumes which though inferior in splendor to the elegant edition since published by mr stevens has obtained its editor most distinguished credit for his assiduity and critical accumen two years after the appearance of this work mr malone published a letter to dr farmer relative to some distorted facts in a pamphlet entitled cursory criticisms on his edition of shakspeare and in      an octavo volume entitled an enquiry into the authenticity of certain miscellaneous papers etc attributed to shakspeare the latter of these performances had the honor of giving the finishing stroke to the infamous forgery of the shaksperian mss vide ireland and if we extend our indulgence to some extraneous matter and a certain selfcomplacent sarcastic asperity flowing through the volume we cannot but pronounce it a most masterly piece of criticism and a very learned and entertaining book by this work mr malone made a pious offering to the manes of his celebrated author and gave the public a new proof of his indefatigable diligence and accuracy mr malone was one of the executors of sir joshua reynolds and published his works in two volumes quarto in

of lehena in ireland and the lady of sir william manners of bucminsterpark leicestershire her ladyship published in      a most elegantlyprinted volume of poems chiefly of the ballad or elegiac kind these productions cannot lay claim to firstrate excellence in point of genius and poetry yet the ease elegance taste and charming simplicity which generally pervade them will lay almost every reader under a contribution of applause while the virtuous sentiments and amiable feelings which they discover in the writer may confirm them by a fair example in the rectitude of goodness  manning rev james pastor of the united congregation of dissenters in exeter he published in      a sketch of the life and writings of the rev micaiah towgood in an octavo volume and has since that time written a funeral sermon for the late dr rice harris and exercises of piety translated from the french edition of the original german of zollikofre they are all very respectable performances  manning thomas esquire late of caius college cambridge and author of an introduction to arithmetic and algebra in an octavo volume published in      the completion of this design was intended in another vovolume but we have understood that owing to the nonadmission of the part already published as a lecturebook in the university this completion is a matter of great uncertainty for ourselves we must own that the present publication appears to us from the manner of its execution to cast no new light or beauty on the branch of science of which it treats and to have been an unnecessary undertaking after the then recent labors of mr wood but the causes of authorship are many and various  mante thomas esquire assistant engineer during the siege of the havanna and major of a brigade in the campaign of      he

volumes a translation into english of the first part of the fourth edition of michaelis introduction to the new testament a work which he has executed with most distinguished ability and which exhibits in our language a counterpart of the excellent performance of the german professor whose name will be ever uttered with respect as long as learning is an object of esteem mr marsh has been for some time employed in preparing the remainder of this valuable work for the press he has also published the substance of two excellent discourses preached before the university of cambridge in

octavo volume of letters to the late mr archdeacon travis in confirmation of the opinion that a greek ms in the public library at cambridge is one of the seven quoted by r stephens at   john v   a volume which notwithstanding the whimsical appearance of an algebraical theorem which he has introduced for determining the identity of mss and which has drawn a smile from some of his readers is a new proof of his learning diligence and accuracy  marshall william an eminent writer on the subject of agriculture than whom none have done more toward diffusing the important knowledge of rural economy he was according to his own account born a farmer bred to traffic and returned to the plow his first publication was minutes of agriculture made on a farm of three hundred acres of various

or the knowledge of the editor  maskelyne rev nevil dd frs astronomer royal an appointment which he obtained in the year      and a very celebrated mathematician and natural philosopher he was

indefatigable labourer sunk under his task and died when only five pages of his work remained unfinished bequeathing the world a most remarkable monument of human industry dr maskelyne had always

elegant scholar and a worthy man he was educated at eton school took the degree of bachelor of arts at cambridge in      and was for some time fellow of trinity college his first publication was a quarto pamphlet in      consisting of runic odes imitated from the norse tongue two years afterward he published in a small octavo volume an essay on the evidence external and internal relating to the poems attributed to thomas rowley this performance contains a general view of the whole controversy respecting those poems and is justly entitled to the character of a candid and comprehensive essay we believe that dr glynn of cambridge gave mr mathias some assistance in this work in these latter days mr mathias has amused himself and the public with several satirical pieces which while the times are peculiarly in need of such effusions do the highest honor to his wit and talents it is not without some scruples that we speak on this subject as his publications of this cast have always been anonymous and the author has been studiously concealed yet when we reflect that in every such instance his exertions have done him the utmost credit both as a scholar and as a man and that it is our duty to report our information on these occasions to the public we trust we may proceed to his pen we have little hesitation in ascribing the three following excellent poetical pamphlets viz the political dramatist of the house of commons in      a pair of epistles to dr randolph and the earl of jersey and the imperial epistle from kien long to george iii as also a letter to the marquis of buckingham chiefly on the subject of the numerous emigrant french priests by a layman the author of the celebrated satirical poem the pursuits of literature it has been said that more persons than one were concerned in this publication and the poetical part has been attributed to the rev mr mansell public orator at cambridge upon this we will only remark that he is a very intimate friend of mr mathias we also refer the reader to a note in page  0  of our first volume in four parts of which the first was published in      remained long unknown we subjoin this excellent performance to the above list from a conviction that considered in every possible point of view it cannot but redound most highly to the credit of the writer the cause of literature has never been supported in a day of danger and perversion upon principles more excellent or with powers better adapted to their object the author of this poem may claim the character of a noble patriot in literature of a man whose piety and orthodoxy are an ornament to human nature and the christian faith of a politician whose sentiments and example are an honor to the government and ministry under which he lives of a scholar whose seize are of firstrate excellence and of a satirist whose keenest arrow is always directed by the hand of a gentleman the few false opinions and false judgments which this poem contains are trifling indeed when compared with its numerous merits the various and extensive learning exhibited in the notes is conveyed in so lively a manner as to delight almost every reader more pains however might perhaps with propriety have been taken in polishing the style of the notes and we think the ingenious author after expressing the above sentiments we hope we may be allowed to refer the author of this poem to the article edward king in this work and likewise to express our surprise that he should confer on mr sulivans view of nature the character of a work of labor and of general utility digested from original writers with judgment etc could this be because it came from the same shop might as well have left mr stevens to tell his story of the peg  maurice rev thomas am historiographer we believe to the east india company and a very learned ingenious and diligent scholar he was educated at university college oxford afterward became chaplain to the   th regiment and lived for some years at woodford in essex he published in      a quarto volume of poems and miscellaneous pieces with a free translation of the oedipus tyrannus of sophocles most of these poems had appeared in print before separately netherby the oldest of them was published in      they possess much merit but did not obtain their author that credit which his latter writings have acquired him about a year previously to this volume mr maurice had printed a fast sermon which we believe is his only publication in the class of divinity in      he wrote ierne rediviva an ode inscribed to the volunteers of ireland and two years afterward westminster abbey an elegiac poem both of which pieces increased his reputation as a poet in      mr maurice published panthea a tragedy from a story in xenophon which did not add greatly to his fame and relinquishing here the line of authorship which he had hitherto traced he has since acquired the greatest eminence and distinction in another track this is a circumstance which cannot but appear surprising for what reader with all his approbation of mr maurices abilities as an historian can help yielding the palm to his poetical talents in the year    0 he published a letter addressed to the directors of the east india company containing proposals for printing a history of the revolutions of the empire of hindostan from the earliest ages and has since that time published indian antiquities in six volumes octavo the two first of which appeared in      and the first volume in quarto of the history of hindostan published in      the former of these works is introductory to and illustrative of the latter although it was sanctioned by the approbation of the east india company and sir william jones it obtained only a dozen subscribers in the course of twelve months at present however the merit of the author of these works is well known to the public and has obtained him a most distinguished reputation his erudition diligence and ingenuity are very remarkable his greatest fault is an imagination too florid and poetical for his undertaking and not sufficiently reducible to method and the power of condensing in      mr maurice published in

this literary veteran has been distinguished for more than fifty years as one of the most elegant scholars and classical writers of his time few authors have contributed so much to the improvement of our style or have exhibited in their works such complete models of elegant writing such specimens of correct choice and perspicuous arrangement of words and of harmonious construction of periods mr melmoth is a son of the late eminent advocate of the same name who wrote an admirable treatise on the great importance of a religious life he died in      and it is said of him few ever passed a more useful none a more blameless life the first publication of the subject of this article was the letters of sir thomas fitzosborne on several subjects in an octavo volume these admired letters made their first appearance about the year      and have experienced that favorable reception and general circulation to which their very sterling merit entitles them mr melrmoths elegant translation of plinys epistles made its first appearance in two octavo volumes in      about four years before the translation by the earl of orrery to which it was justly preferred in      he published in three octavo volumes a translation of ciceros letters to his friends with remarks in which the patriot character ofth a celebrated roman is justly questioned and in      and      translations of ciceros cato and laelius each in an octavo volume with remarks these finished performances have acquired mr melmoth the greatest reputation possible as an elegant and accurate scholar they will probably speak for him while roman and english eloquence can be united yet when we consider them as specimens of translation we cannot help thinking that he is too often led away by the vanity of improving upon his author that he frequently sacrifices his original to a false refinement and an overspun delicacy of phrase and lastly that he has too much of what the greeks express by the forcible term  in the year      after a long repose mr melmoth was constrained to resume his pen upon the occasion of a very unprovoked attack from mr bryant in his treatise on the truth of the christian religion the grounds of this attack were mr melmoths remarks in his translation of plinys letters respecting trajans persecution of the christians in bythinia and he wrote a pamphlet in answer to mr bryant in which he vindicated himself with great ability and proved his point two years after this mr melmoth published memoirs of a late eminent advocate his father in a thin octavo volume which is a tribute of filial

sympathy kept up at intervals for two years many new correspondents came forward but the writers remained long unknown to the public and to one another time at last discovered della crusca and anna

greatest claim to distinction of any his poem diversity and ambitions vengeance a tragicdrama are to be found in these volumes in speaking of mr merrys pretensions to same as a poet we must observe that he has been loudly decried and stigmatized by an elegant satirist of the present day vide william gifford esquire who has said of one of his pieces the laurel of liberty that it is distinguished by downright nonsense downright frigidity and downright doggerel we own that his false glitter his negligence and his obscurity are frequently highly reprehensible yet cannot but allow that his pretensions to poetical merit are often great and striking while the spirit of liberty and benevolence which breathes through his writings seems ardent and sincere his poem entitled the pains of memory has been preferred by many readers to mr rogers popular poem the pleasures of memory  michell charles esquire of forcett the author of an octavo volume published in      entitled principles of

vicarage in      vacated by the death of the rev mr clarke mr milners first publication account of christianity considered together with some strictures on humes dialogues concerning natural religion a performance which though written with the most laudable intention possible is perhaps too angry and dogmatical to entitle him to much credit in      he published essays on several religious subjects chiefly tending to illustrate the scripture doctrine of the influence of the holy spirit in a duodecimo volume these essays were chiefly intended as an answer to mr ludlams theological essays since that time he has published two volumes in octavo of a history of the church of christ upon the whole it is perhaps to be lamented in the case of mr milner that with abilities and knowledge like his he should not have been more assiduous in cultivating the character of a wellbred and attractive writer  milner rev john fas a roman catholic clergyman of a private chapel in winchester he published a sensible discourse on his majestys recovery      in which be has introduced a very elaborate and truly jesuitical justification of the principles and conduct of modern catholics mr milner has also

 see gunning  mitford william esquire mp frs lieutenant colonel of the south hampshire militia and brother to sir john mitford solicitor general to his majesty this gentleman is one of those characters in the republic of letters which we contemplate with peculiar satisfaction he has devoted the leisure of a military life to the cultivation of letters has served the truest interests of the literary community by bringing to classic regions fresh accessions of light and certainty and has always preserved in his writings a manliness of deportment and strength of character which entitle him to the highest admiration as a citizen of that community ford and has bestowed much time and attention on his favorite study of antiquities his chief work the history of greece is a performance which does him infinite credit to those who are acquainted with the intricacy of many parts of grecian history with the extreme difficulty of collecting the scattered members of it of detecting the supposititious and doubtful among what is related by inferior or later authors and of ascertaining and arranging the genuine and lastly without the assistance of invention of forming from parts so broken and dispersed a harmonizing whole he will appear highly to deserve the character of a learned and accurate historian his history of greece is not the work of a closet critic or a monkish philosopher but owes its existence to a most comprehensive mind and correct judgment happily blended with extensive knowledge and an acquaintance with the modes and manners of life he frequently and his union of characters soldier seaman statesman scholar poet and philosopher while his just estimation of his invaluable guides thucydides and xenophon increases our admiration of the soldierphilosopher who is our own much of the earlier part of this valuable work was written in camps and in quarters during the american war it was first published by single quarto volumes of which the first appeared in      two years previous to the history by dr gillies vide that name at present three of these volumes are published and the third edition was printed in octavo each of the original volumes forming two of these ten years previous to the first appearance of this work mr mitford had published anonymously an essay upon to illustrate that of the english language and in      he wrote a pamphlet entitled considerations on the opinion stated by the lords of the committee of council in a representation to the king upon the corn laws that great britain is unable to produce corn sufficient for its own consumption etc  in his most distinguished character as an author we assert without hesitation of mr mitford that the industry with which he has collected his materials from ancient sources and brought together from distant quarters whatever might serve to which he discovers in comparing the various representations given by different authors of the same facts his perfect originality of thought and expression the display of general knowledge which he so agreably and judiciously introduces his comprehension of mind in the arrangement of the whole his found learning his strength of judgment his diligent investigation all unite in entitling him to the first place among the historians of greece it is unfortunate that amid so much perfection there should be found a single blemish yet the style of mr mitford can certainly not be said to possess that grace and polish which would display to most advantage the many excellencies of his writings with the generality of readers the beauties of style are of the highest consideration could mr mitford boast this among his other superiorities few indeed would be the historians who would have greater claims to distinction  moir rev john a native of scotland formerly a clergyman of the church of scotland and now of the church of england he is a writer of considerable ability but owing to a large family and a small curacy we believe he has felt severely the hardships of poverty he published in      a duodecimo volume of discourses on practical subjects and in      an octavo volume of sermons on some of the most useful and interesting subjects in religion and life a history of the life and public services of mr fox and a history of transactions in india from    0 each in an octavo volume have also been attributed to him mr moir is moreover supposed to have been concerned in some of the newspapers and has lately written some single sermons and an octavo volume entitled preventive policy the latter of these works aims at an humble defense of our whole establishment in every form of property and distinction it involves and as its drift is to guard the interests of the opulent a copy was left at many of the principal houses in the metropolis in the hope that some consideration might be deemed due to the labor of the author there is an affected profundity in many of the reflections of mr moir but upon the whole his style of writing is good and his talents appear to be very respectable  moises rev edward am of trinity college cambridge and master of the royal grammar school at

volumes he has since that time written edward a novel in two octavo volumes which like zeluco exhibits various views of human nature but its characters are more indigenous to our own soil it is hardly necessary for us to add of so popular a writer as mr moore that his works discover him to possess great insight into human nature and that happy union of acute discernment with a lively imagination by which he is enabled to describe its intricacies with the greatest pleasantry  moore rev charles am rector of cuxton and vicar of boughtonblean kent and formerly fellow of trinity college cambridge

pamphlet they abound with more exquisite ideas than are often to be found in so small a compass and entitle their author to the credit of very uncommon abilities it is to be lamented however that talents so shining should not have been directed to nobler purposes than the perversion of young minds by the most studied and unblushing obscenity the pamphlet as was to be expected has seen no less than fourteen editions and could captain morris ascertain the real evil he has done to society by such a publication it might greatly contribute to tinge with a browner shade the evening of his life

appearance by mr thelwall as a shameful plagiarism from an historical opera entitled the incas or the peruvian virgin which he had offered without success to mr harris nine months previously zorinski has also been accused as a plagiarism from brookes gustavus vasa mr mortons cure for the heart ache is in our opinion the best of his dramatic pieces they have many of them experienced considerable favor from the public and have raised their author to the character of a very successful modern playwriter as to their absolute merit however we must observe that although they have been approved in an age in which dramatic composition is at a most melancholy ebb in which our plays wear no longer the stamp of real life neither does their coloring show the breathing vivacity of original observation in which the strongest effort of dramatic satire is to make an actor who is endowed with particular talents laugh before his audience at a reigning eccentricity and not as formerly personate the character to which it is peculiar and in which an eternal repitition of some contemptible vulgarity is to supply the places of wit and brilliancy yet their existence we must hope is eminently precarious for should a tolerable taste ever again favor a british audience posterity shall with difficulty credit that such plays were heard and with still greater difficulty that they were applauded  moseley walter michael esquire the author of a very agreeable essay on archery describing the practice of that art in all ages and nations which he published in an octavo volume in      a

the first is translated from crebillon news from parnassus a prelude know your own mind and the choice comedies and three weeks after marriage a farce these pieces were printed separately at the time of their first appearance and have since been collected in the edition of mr murphys works in seven octavo volumes published in      they have many of them considerable pretensions to merit the most distinguished are probably the grecian daughter and three weeks after marriage which last had been most capriciously condemned under its first title viz what we must all come to in the abovementioned edition of his works is also to be found the rival sisters a tragedy which mr murphy never offered to the stage and some smaller poems a few of which had been published separately some elegant translations from the english into latin verse which are given in this edition do the highest honor to mr murphys talents among them the translation of grays elegy is eminently beautiful the first specimen of his skill at biographical writing was a copious and most entertaining essay on the life and genius of henry fielding prefixed to the edition of that authors works which was published in      about five years afterward he published in a duodecimo volume a most excellent translation of marmontels belisarius neither of these productions are to be found in the sevenvolume edition of mr murphys works his writings since the publication of that edition have been seventeen hundred and ninetyone a poem in imitation of the thirteenth satire of juvenal of which johnson after giving us his noble imitations of the third and tenth satires said he wished this satire also was done an essay on the life and genius of dr johnson published in an octavo volume in      and prefixed to mr murphys edition of dr johnsons works in twelve volumes octavo and a translation of the works of tacitus published in      in four quarto volumes  as the biographer of dr johnson we feel little hesitation in giving mr murphy the first place among the many who have aspired to that character his short essay is the production of a writer who has duly weighed and rightly conceived that judicious uniformity of coloring which while it gratifies the readers curiosity never fails to hold in its just light the object which it represents and while we have been disgusted with the impertinent prattle which by some writers has been so freely expended upon this virtuous and wise though partial and austere character we find in this essay a manliness and propriety of conduct which can always keep up in our minds an interest in his behalf without ever forfeiting the dignity of its object his opinions upon the writings of his author are highly judicious and most honorable to his critical talents and his edition of dr johnsons works clearly entitles him to the same place among the editors of that great character which we have given him among his biographers as a translator of tacitus mr murphy will find most favor from those who are most acquainted with the peril of his situation the celebrated mr gray in one of his letters declares that he found himself after making an attempt unequal to the task of giving tacitus a becoming dress in our language a better judge than mr gray of such an undertaking will not easily be found we are sorry that we can say nothing in praise of mr murphys laborious work the freedom of his translation appears to us the leading circumstance against his success but when we add that notwithstanding every license of this kind the english work he has afforded us is far from an elegant composition can we say that he has kept any measures with justice in the execution of his task the merit however of his original writings will supersede every unfavourable impression of an unfortunate attempt and gain his writings a lasting distinction among the works of taste it is said that he has been for some time engaged in writing the life of his friend foot few are so equal

first appeared in america his reason for adding the e final always afterward is left to the penetration of the reader thomas this notorious character was born in      at thetford in norfolk his father was a staymaker he was himself brought up to that profession and exercised it during his youth at london dover and sandwich he afterward turned exciseman and grocer at jews in sussex and upon the occasion of an election at shoreham in      the poets of jews being called upon by the candidate of fairest pretensions to furnish an election song pain entered the lists obtained the laurel and was presented with three guineas this we believe was his first public appearance as an author in the year following a design having been formed by the excise officers throughout the kingdom to apply to parliament for a consideration of the state of their salaries he wrote their case in an octavo pamphlet of twentyone pages which was republished in london a few years ago having been discovered as a grocer to deal in exciseable articles and as a grinder of snuff to buy smuggled tobacco he was dismissed from the excise in      after twelve years service in the mean time pain by his case of the excisemen and by his plausibility of manner had attracted the notice of the late mr george lewis scott commissioner of excise this gentleman recommended him strongly to the celebrated dr benjamin franklin as a person who could be serviceable at that time in america and pain set sail for pennsylvania in september      upon a letter of introduction to governor franklin of the jerseys it was two years after this that he attracted great notice by the publication of his pamphlet entitled common sense designed as this production was to ridicule and expose the absurdity of monarchical government it proved highly palatable to the republican taste of the united states it has been called one of those few literary performances which have been known to produce a great and sudden effect upon the sentiments and conduct of a nation and having been published at a very critical period the commencement of the american war served more than any thing else to induce the inhabitants of that country to an immediate declaration of independence at the latter end of the same year      he began to publish in the pennsylvania journal the crisis a periodical essay which appeared as often during the continuance of hostilities as his idea of the state of affairs required the congress at first managed their european concerns by a committee for secret correspondence but their demands for european aid becoming more urgent the secret committee was converted into a committee for foreign affairs pain who was now becoming a celebrated character in the united states was appointed secretary to this committee but being detected in retailing through the newspapers what he confidentially knew from the foreign correspondence he was forced to resign that office soon after this he obtained the degree of m a from the university of pennsylvania was chosen a member of the american philosophical society and when the congress had rejected him as unworthy of trust the assembly of pennsylvania which had been purged of quakers by his pen thought him fit for its clerk in      he printed at philadelphia a letter to the abbe raynal on the affairs of north america in which he undertook to correct and clear up the mistakes in the abbes account of the revolution a little later in the same year and at the same place he also printed a letter to the earl of shelburne on his speech in parliament july  0th      in which the noble earl had said that when great britain shall acknowledge american independence the sun of britains glory is set for ever both of these letters were shortly afterward reprinted in london in the autumn of      pain left america with the intention of going to france and arrived at paris early in      having left no great share of popularity behind him his stay here was short and he reached london in the autumn of the same year before the conclusion of      he published a pamphlet upon the recent transactions between great britain and holland entitled prospects on the rubicon in which he censured the measures of the english administration  we come now to that period in paines history when his speculations were to shake the fabric of the public mind to its very foundation and his writings to infuse a poison among a deluded commonalty the effects of which to a philosopher in the shade would have been scarcely credible being released in november      from a sponginghouse into which a debt contracted by the project of erecting an iron bridge had brought him he beheld with delight the proceedings of that memorable year in france and hastened to that country soon however he recrossed the channel and in his road to london encountered mr burkes farfamed pamphlet which appeared a few days before the celebration of the french revolution november  th    0 a few months labor produced part i of the rights of man it was submitted to the revisal of mr brand hollis and a democratic committee and after some struggles between the desires of the author and the wishes of his patrons was committed by them to the press in february      it was printed for johnson in st pauls church yard but his regard for the credit of his shop induced him to decline the sale and a delay of a month in the publication thus took place a few copies were however smuggled into private hands and at length on the   th of march      it was published by jordan in fleet street with a dedication to general washington the apprehensions of pain upon this occasion seem to have been very great always ready to take wing for france he fluttered with anxiety about the metropolis at length finding that the ministry trusting to the good sense of the people gave itself no concern about him he took a lodging in fetter lane where he remained till his final departure and immediately went to work at part ii of the rights of man this was published by jordan early in      it is well known that the jacobin societies took the utmost pains to distribute cheap editions of this work over the whole nation particularly in manufactories and among the laboring poor it is even said that tobacco grocery and sweetmeats for children were frequently sold in wrappers of its sheets many answers to the two parts were produced at the press and at the anniversary meeting of the constitutional society on the   th of april      the members of these jacobin societies were stated to exceed forty thousand persons government at length became alarmed prosecutions were commemced in may      against pain as the author and jordan as the publisher of rights of man the royal proclamation was issued stating that seditious writings had been industriously dispersed for inciting discontent and warning all magistrates to be diligent in suppressing tumult and preserving quiet both houses of parliament declared their abhorrence of writings which had anarchy for their end and proclaimed their unalterable resolution to maintain the authority of the laws the city of london avowed her loyalty to the king and her attachment to the constitution the other corporations followed the example of the metropolis and the countymeetings joined in the general abhorrence of innovation and in the universal determination to support the wise system of policy which had been transmitted by the wisdom of their ancestors pain was now employed in writing those letters for the argus which were afterward distributed from the pamphletshops under the title of paines four letters on government shortly afterward he produced a pamphlet consisting of two letters to lord onslow and one to mr dundas and another pamphlet containing a letter to the addressers on the late proclamation the great object of which was to procure a national convention in contempt of the parliament he was at the same time readily adopted as a proper citizen by a country which had recently plunged into the depths of anarchy and when the jacobin clubs were about to form a convention at paris of turbulent spirits from every quarter of the world several departments contended for the honor of being represented by the celebrated thomas pain calais bore away the glorious prize from all her competitors and she sent citizen audibert to signify his appointment and to solicit his acceptance of it he required little solicitation and quitting london on the   th of september      was received with open arms on the following day on the shores of calais he was tried by a special jury at guildhall and convicted as a malignant libeller and soon afterward his effigy and his books were burned in almost every village in england his conviction made him an outlaw and having joined the convention at paris in a declaration of war against great britain he has since that time become a traitor amid the changes of government in france pain did not escape notice and when robespierre began to gain an ascendancy he was sent with anacharsis cloots to the prison at luxemburg he however escaped the guillotine and during his confinement composed his work entitled the age of reason part i of which was published in london in      and part ii in the year following this work naturally produced several answers at the press among which the apology for the bible by the bishop of landaff is to be most eminently distinguished paines subsequent writings have been a dissertation on the first principles of government the decline and fall of the english system of finance a most impudent letter to general washington and agrarian justice opposed to agrarian law and to agrarian monopoly all pamphlets  the abuse which has been so liberally bestowed upon pain as a writer has perhaps for the most part been the result of a zeal whose tendency is to weaken more than to support its cause let us rather allow him the qualified credit of an animated energetic writer who displays considerable acuteness but whose manner of thinking is rude wicked and daring and whose language is vulgar though impressive let us rather rejoice that englishmen with their just veneration for civil liberty and the rights of the people were found so wise and steadfast in an hour of danger as to despise those sorry calculators that would persuade a country whose constitution has raised her to be the envy of all the civilized world to hazard that constitution upon the grossest clumsiest and stalest theories let us be thankful that the archtheorist of the rights of man of those rights which transfer the reins from his passion to his reason of those rights which dissolve ties which confound distinctions which destroy security could play upon us with his new lights upon human governments without dazzling our reason or impairing our eyesight finally let us rejoice that when this wily and audacious anarch dared at last to attack the sacred volume of our religion there was found on our bench of bishops a learned and philosophical prelate condescending enough and active enough to oppose them nobly and completely by his erudition his clearness and his strength of argument  paley rev william dd archdeacon of carlisle etc a most venerable and distinguished character as a sound reasoner a wellread scholar and an excellent divine he was educated at christs college cambridge took his degree of bachelor of arts with great distinction in      and afterward became tutor of the above society his works have experienced that brilliant success to which their very extraordinary value entitles them the first of them excepting single sermons was his highly celebrated principles of moral and political philosophy which was first published in a quarto volume in      and has since been very frequently reprinted with corrections and improvements in two octavo volumes it is hardly possible to say too much in favor of this treatise the ripest schoolman may read it with instruction and delight while it contains amusement for the most volatile fancy it has obtained its author one distinction among others singularly glorious and most probably unparallelled we mean the circumstance of its chapters being very frequently subjects for disputation in the schools of one of our universities at the same time with sections of the immortal principia of newton or with chapters of the celebrated essay of lock thus the distinguished honors which such transcendent characters are proud to receive after death are conferred on dr paley while alive the style of this work is admirably adapted to its subject and is perhaps one of the best models for the imitation of youth which can be found in our language while the fine reasoning the pertinency of illustration the strong integrity of judgment and the great comprehension of mind which pervade it may be fit objects of its emulation provided it duly estimate the labor of thought and application necessary to such acquisitions and form not after all too sanguine hopes of reaching such perfection some remarks upon this work have been written by

university with the celebrated mathematician mr atwood they both took their degrees of b a in      and to mr parkinson was adjudged the superiority in mathematical knowledge the world however from the specimens which each of these gentlemen have given it as writers on subjects of science will be disposed to wonder at this decision dr parkinson published in      in a quarto volume a system of mechanics and hydrostatics the substance of his lectures as a public tutor of this work we do not scruple to declare that it is one of the clumsiest which has ever come from the hands of an able proficient in natural philosophy who has attempted to facilitate the progress of the student by a selection from the works of others it is a disgraceful specimen of the proficiency of an university who prides herself on polishing the abstruseness of science and uniting in her studies an elegance with a profundity of research it is of a character so coarse and rugged and of a bulk so unnecessarily huge as to frighten rather than encourage the student finally it is the work of a writer whose elegance of thought whose justness of conception whose perspicuity of arrangement and whose beauty of operation can in no wise be compared with the masterly specimens of the union of all these excellencies which have been afforded us by mr atwood beside this work dr parkinson has published two single sermons  parr rev samuel lld a most elegant and profound scholar very highly celebrated for his knowledge of the greek language he was originally one of the undermasters of harrow school and in that situation had the honor of sharing in the education among others of mr richard brinsley sheridan upon a vacancy in the headmastership in    0 dr parr became a candidate for that office and his cause was so warmly espoused by many of the boys of the school as to occasion very turbulent proceedings proving unsuccessful he retired to a village at a small distance from harrow and opened a school to which he was followed by many of the harrow scholars dr parr was afterward appointed by the earl of dartmouth to superintend the education of his eldest son lord viscount lewisham in consequence of which he resigned his school and fixed his residence at colchester where he was attended by his lordship and one or two more pupils at the expiration of this engagement he was chosen master of the free school at norwich which he conducted with great reputation and has now been settled for some years in the neighborhood of warwick in the occupation of educating private pupils  dr parrs first publications were sermons preached at norwich during the american war of these two appeared with his name in    0 and a third a fast sermon under the name phileleutherus norfolciensis in the year following the last of these is particularly excellent in      he published a fourth sermon preached for the benefit of the charity schools in norwich it was in the year following this that he published a new edition in an octavo volume of the three books de statu of bellendenus master of the pleas to james i and prefixed a most elegant preface few pieces of composition in latin have been more admired than this masterly preface it was reprinted separately in the year following its first publication it consists chiefly of a political retrospect of the internal transactions of britain since the year      and presents us an animated panegyric of lord north mr burke and mr fox with a glowing invective against the methods employed to deprive them of the share they held in the government of their country the latin as well as the english style of dr parr is always strong manly and beautiful but perhaps it possesses upon the whole less of grace and elegance than of energy in      dr parr published tracts by warburton and a warburtonian not admitted into the collection of their respective works in an octavo volume almost every reader will condemn the poignancy of language which is used in the preface to this volume against the venerable bishop of worcester while he will confess with pleasure that the characters of jortin leland and warburton are amply and beautifully delineated in the year      dr parr published an octavo pamphlet entitled a sequel to the printed paper lately circulated in warwickshire by the rev charles curtis brother of alderman curtis a birmingham rector etc which reached a second edition this was occasioned by a suspicion that mr curtis had written certain anonymous letters which were sent to the doctor that he had uttered certain reflections upon him in his pulpit discourses and that he had sent the printed paper which appeared auctior et emendatior in an evening newspaper the same year produced dr parrs celebrated and excellent letter from irenopolis to the inhabitants of eleutheropolis which is a serious address to the dissenters of birmingham written in consequence of a report that they intended a second commemoration of the french revolution and was published in a shilling pamphlet for an account of dr parrs literary association with the late mr homer and dr comb relative to the publication of an edition of horace we refer the reader to our memoir of the lastmentioned gentleman where he will also see the occasion which produced dr parrs excellent pamphlet entitled remarks on the statement of dr charles comb by an occasional writer in the british critic  it may very reasonably be questioned whether the services which dr parr has done to the world have been adequate to his ability or his knowledge much is to be allowed however for that want of leisure and opportunity which every man of letters must feel whole constant and necessary occupation is the instruction of youth to the character of a profound scholar though the printed testimonies he has afforded us may have been slender none shall dare to dispute his claim and were our remaining possessions of greek and latin authors to share the fate of the celebrated alexandrian library we believe that this gigantic proficient could afford us from recollection a very tolerable idea of grecian and roman literature of the english style of dr parr it has been said that it unites the strength of johnson with the richness of burke  parsons william esquire this gentleman was one of the gleaners of laurels on the banks of

pennant condemned himself and his subsequent resuscitation had a very whimsical appearance but those who were most in habits of intimacy with him while he lived and knew best the pleasure and

english poetry published by dodsley in three duodecimo volumes and six years afterward he published the hermit of warkworth a northumberland ballad in the class of divinity we believe his lordship has only printed a single sermon for the curious anecdotes and literary information to be found in the edition of the tatler with illustrations and notes historical biographical and critical published in

add she had done better to have staid at home  pindar peter  see walcot  pinkerton john fsa perth a native of scotland his first publication was an octavo volume in      which he entitled rimes being of opinion that uniformity of stanza when protracted to any degree must ever fatigue as extinguishing the great source of all pleasure variety he here adopted a series of stanzas in which as in the greek strophe antistrophe and epode the two first correspond and are succeeded by a third of a different measure but the specimen with which mr pinkerton here presented the public was by no means peculiarly engaging in the year following he published tales in verse in a quarto pamphlet and also two dithyrambic odes which are more distinguished by harshness and affected singularity than by any species of excellence mr pinkertons next publication was a useful essay on medals which first appeared anonymously in a single octavo volume in      and was enlarged to two volumes in the second edition the valuable assistance of dr comb and mr southgate we believe were afforded the author upon this occasion in      mr pinkerton published ancient scottish poems never before in print in two crownoctavo volumes and in the year following a dissertation on the origin and progress of the scythians or goths in an octavo volume his subsequent publications have been an enquiry into the history of scotland preceding the reign of malcolm iii in two octavo volumes published in      the first genuine edition of barbours bruce with notes and a glossary in three volumes duodecimo published in    0 scottish poems reprinted from scarce editions in three octavo volumes published in      iconographia scotica or portraits of illustrious persons of scotland with short biographical notices part i ii iii iv and the history of scotland from the accession of the house of stuart to that of mary with appendixes of original papers in two volumes quarto published in      in the last of these works mr pinkerton has judiciously chosen the period of scottish history which remained insulated between the accurate investigation of the earlier age by sir david dalrymple and the elegant history of the later times by dr robertson he has produced a work of great merit and should it experience the favorable reception to which we think it entitled it is his design to write upon the same plan the history of scotland from the earliest accounts to the accession of the house of stuart upon the whole our opinion of mr pinkerton as a writer is that notwithstanding an occasional unpleasant appearance of vanity pedantry causticity and want of taste he is possessed of real and extensive knowledge much good sense and sufficient originality we think he is somewhat amenable on the score of bookmaking  piozzi hesther lynch a lady of considerable notoriety in the literary world she is the daughter of john salisbury esquire formerly of bachygraig in the county of flint and neice to sir thomas salisbury who rose to considerable eminence as a civilian in doctors commons in      she married the late henry thrale esquire a distinguished brewer in the borough of southwark this excellent man in the year following his marriage was introduced by mr murphy to the acquaintance of dr samuel johnson the intimacy of that celebrated character with this family daily increased and he soon became an almost constant inmate of their country residence at streatham the conduct of mr thrale to dr johnson was indeed truly praiseworthy his family contributed for fifteen years to the prolongation and comfort of a most valuable life and when the benevolent master sunk into the grave the memory of his kindness was acknowledged by the loving object of his regard with the confession that with him were buried many of his hopes and pleasures that the face upon which he had looked for the last time had never been turned upon him but with respect and benignity that he obtained from him many opportunities of amusement and turned his thoughts to him as to a refuge from misfortunes upon the death of mr thrale his widow finding it as she asserts extremely perplexing and difficult to live in the same house with the doctor took advantage of a lost lawsuit to plead inability of purse for remaining longer in london or its vicinity and retired to bath where she knew he would not follow her she continued however to correspond with dr johnson till near the time july      of her marriage to her second husband signior piozzi a native of florence and a musicmaster of the city of bath when a very warm expostulation on the part of the doctor against this step dissolved their friendship soon after her union with mr piozzi she traveled with him to the place of his birth and visited several parts of europe before they returned to england  during her residence in florence in      chance having brought together at that place a few english of both sexes particularly mr merry mr parsons and mr greathead they wrote in association the florence miscellany a collection of pieces in prose and verse of which a few copies have been printed but it has not been published some specimens of this flighty production appeared in a newspaper of the day called the world as well as in several of the magazines the preface was written by mrs piozzi to whom we believe the conduct of the work had been committed several other fugitive poetical pieces by mrs piozzi as the three warnings a tale imitated from la fontaine a translation of boileaus epistle to his gardener first printed in mrs williams miscellanies and a prologue to the royal suppliants have reached the public eye among these the first is to be particularly distinguished as a very masterly production and it has been strongly suspected that dr johnson either wrote it or assisted in the composition of it the former opinion we think from the style of the piece is improbable but that it has felt his correcting hand we have little doubt  the first regular exploit of mrs piozzi in authorship was made in the year      when she produced her crownoctavo volume of anecdotes of dr johnson two years after this she published a collection of letters to and from dr johnson from      to      in two octavo volumes her anecdotes as coming from the pen of a writer who had long shared the society and friendship of that illustrious character were perused with great avidity but time has dissolved the charm they bring us acquainted it is true with the domestic transactions and introduce us to the private hours of the object held up to our view yet what of this when as admirers of the learning and moral excellence of their hero we glow at almost every page with indignation that his weaknesses and his failings should be disclosed to public view there is surely something sacred attached in every wellconstituted mind to the memory of a character which beside extorting from us a tribute of admiration by its public name has mingled its social intercourse with our private lives has confirmed and instructed us by its example and its precepts and displayed to us upon a nearer view a proportional degree of that excellence which same had conceded as its due to a mind of this make the stamp of death would enliven the impressions it had received and creating a melancholy and awful veneration for the departed object of its regard forget its failings amid its pious fondness for the pleasing remembrance of its worth the name of johnson shall live while piety while virtue while learning are regarded yet johnson after the luster he had reflected on the name of thrale after the delight which his counsel and his friendship had for many years afforded to the family aged and infirm was to be deserted by his only surviving companion and his nurse a year or two before his end and after death to have his memory tortured and abused by her detested itch for scribbling more injury we will venture to affirm has been done to the same of johnson by this lady and her late biographical helpmate boswell than his most avowed enemies have ever been able to effect and if his character becomes unpopular with some of his successors it is to these gossiping friends he is indebted for the favor  in      mrs piozzi published observations and reflections made in the course of a journey through france

entertaining though in many respect very reprehensible to the due execution of the latter a rare combination of talents was requisite among the least of which may be numbered neatness of style acuteness of perception and a more than common accuracy of discrimination this lady on the contrary brought to the task a jargon long since become proverbial for its vulgarity an incapability of defining a single term in the language and just so much latin from a childs syntax as sufficed to expose the ignorance she so anxiously labors to conceal vide preface to baviad   the general character which we are disposed to afford mrs piozzi as an author is that she is possessed of respectable talents and of an education superior to what commonly falls to the lot of the fair sex but that her vanity is so conspicuous upon every occasion as to destroy in most minds any favorable impression which her abilities or her seize might make little indeed do the lessons and example of her austere

historian he was born in    0 at his abovementioned patrimonial estate was educated at the neighboring grammar school of truro became a member of christchurch college oxford was admitted a student in

karnbre a poem the spirit of fraser to general burgoyne an ode the death of hilda an american tale an ode to mrs macaulay on her birthday the castle of tintadgel an ode and the isle of poplars an ode the two last of which were published among racks essays it is curious that the versification of his first production the fate of lewellyn is much more melodious than that of his english orator which is nearly the last but the tale was written to please the ear only in      mr polwhele published anonymously book i of the art of eloquence a didactic poem and also pictures from nature in twelve sonnets each quarto pamphlets the first of these was reprinted in the following year under the title of the english orator and three more books were afterward added in the year      mr polwhele also published a translation into english verse with dissertations and notes of the idyllia epigrams and fragments of theocritus bion and moschus with the elegies of tyrtaeus in a quarto volume which was afterward reprinted in two octavos it is said of this work that it was completed in half a year if so it does great credit to the talents of the writer since many of the translations are extremely happy and considered as a whole it is perhaps a formidable rival of the similar production by mr fawkes in      mr polwhele published two octavo volumes of wellwritten discourses on different subjects and has since that time produced a quarto volume of poems containing his english orator his sonnets and some other pieces a single sermon preached in      at kenton vol i of historical views of devonshire in octavo and vol ii of the history of devonshire in folio the former of the two lastmentioned works is to be completed in five volumes it is a repository of curious notices not interfering with the authors main undertaking the latter of them which is to be comprehended in three volumes and the publication of which was commenced with the second volume in      beside these productions mr polwhele wrote the biographical memoirs of mr rack in collinsons history of somerset and was the editor of two octavo volumes of poems by gentlemen of devon and cornwall who form a literary society whose meetings are held at stated times at the globe inn exeter and of which mr polwhele is one of the oldest members  pope rev john this gentleman was the successor of mr gilbert wakefield as tutor in belleslettres and classical literature at the newcollege hackney and has made himself appear ridiculous enough by attempting to bring his sprinkling of classical knowledge in competition with the copious waters of that celebrated and excellent scholar he published in      a duodecimo volume entitled observations on the miraculous conception etc with remarks on mr wakefields opinion concerning mat xxvii   and also an octavo volume entitled divine worship founded in nature and supported by scripture authority with remarks on mr wakefields arguments against public worship and strictures on some parts of his silva critica and english version of the new testament previous to these publications we believe he had printed a single sermon since their appearance he has published two sermons in an octavo pamphlet the writings of mr pope are by no means destitute of ingenuity or liberality but when in the first instance he attempted a display of learning respecting the word  in opposition to mr wakefield his conduct was surely no less illjudged than his comprehension of the force of his adversaries argument was erroneous he has been some time employed upon a course of remarks on the three greek tragedians with which he seems inclined to favor the world modestly observing that no good edition of those authors had yet appeared the vanity of mr pope is indeed too conspicuous  porson richard esquire ma greek professor in the university of cambridge and formerly fellow of trinity college this gentleman is well known not in this country only for his very extraordinary talents and as the best greek scholar we have he was educated at etonschool took his degree of b a at cambridge in      was always most eminently distinguished for his classical knowledge and succeeded mr cook in the above professorship in the year      mr porsons first regular and avowed publication was his celebrated volume of letters to mr archdeacon travis in answer to his defense of the three heavenly witnesses i john v   which made its appearance in    0 of this work the celebrated mr gibbon has said that it is the most acute and accurate piece of criticism which has appeared since the days of bentley the authors strictures are founded in argument enriched with learning and enlivened with wit and his adversary neither deserves nor finds any quarter at his hands the elegant edition of the seven plays of aeschylus without notes without the scholia and without the fragments which was published by foulis at glasgow in      in a folio volume was clandestinely printed from a text corrected by mr porson that gentleman had lent his manuscript corrections and conjectures on the text of aeschylus to a friend in scotland they fell into the hands of foulis and the abovementioned edition was published without the professors leave or even knowledge mr porson edited the edition of heynes virgil which was printed in london is at present publishing new editions of greek plays with short commentaries by single plays each in an octavo volume some of which have already made their appearance and will shortly we believe produce a new edition of aeschylus complete with notes he has also been for some time preparing for the cambridge press an edition of the inedited greek lexicon of photius from the manuscript in trinity college library a most elegant and masterly copy of this work which his herculean talents and exquisite greek handwriting had produced was not long ago consumed by an accidental fire in a house where it was deposited he has again however assailed the mighty undertaking and will probably soon favor the world with the truly desirable fruit of his industry  it is needless for us to add our eulogium to the well known merit of mr porson as a philologist a very consummate scholar and a most acute and accurate critic many occasional fugitive productions which have either never reached the press or if printed have appeared anonymously are additional testimonies to the just estimation in which he is held by the literary world we have only to lament that he should live below the measure of abilities so transcendent in contradiction to natures design in the talents with which she has so liberally endowed him what is genius says an elegant writer without a regulated life and surely the paultry occupation of writing for a party journal

universities  porter thomas the author of a defense of unitarianisin published in an octavo volume in      and intended as an answer to dr hawkers sermons on the divinity of christ it occasioned a

rector of lambeth and after holding the bishopric of chester for eleven years succeeded to the sea of london in the year      on the decease of the venerable dr lowth and is supposed to have risen to his present high rank through the particular patronage of her majesty dr porteus was educated at christs college cambridge took his degree of b a in      obtaining with baron maseres the chancellors medals at that university on their first institution was for some time fellow of the above society and gained the seatonian prize for a poetical essay on death in      which was published according to the will of the founder his lordship was also for many years chaplain to the late archbishop secker and in association with dr stinton published the seven octavo volumes of sermons by that eminent divine prefixing a review of his graces life and character in the year      dr porteus distinguished himself by his exertions to establish a more solemn observation of the fast good friday and published in that year a serious affectionate and sensible exhortation to that effect this produced a rude illnatured attack upon his lordship from the late mr robert robinson of chesterton near cambridge who published the history and mystery of good friday in order to ridicule the observance of it having previously printed several occasional single sermons dr porteus published in      a brief confutation of the errors of the church of rome extracted from archbishop seckers five sermons against popery and designed for general distribution two years after this he produced a volume of sermons on several subjects to which he added a second volume in the year      in both of these volumes many of the occasional single sermons which his lordship had formerly printed were republished and they are well known to rank among the most perfect examples of pulpit eloquence in our language dr porteus has also published a letter to the clergy of the diocese of chester concerning sunday schools and a charge delivered to the clergy of the diocese of london at the primary visitation in    0 his lordships poetical talents have been handsomely complimented by hannah more in her poem

pott he published in      an octavo volume of poems consisting of odes elegies etc and three years afterward an octavo volume of elegies with selmane a tragedy neither of these productions possesses very distinguished pretensions to merit since that time mr pott has published four charges to the clergy of the archdeaconry of st albans two sermons for the festivals and fasts of the church of england three single sermons preached upon particular occasions and a duodecimo volume of elementary discourses designed for the use of a young person after confirmation his writings in the class of divinity have always been highly acceptable  potter rev r fras minister of scarning and a character of the highest distinction as a classical scholar the literary world is most intrinsically indebted to him for excellent poetical versions of the three greek tragedians mr potter published in      an octavo volume of poems most of the pieces in which had before appeared separately it contains many very pretty compositions particularly a beautiful farewell hymn to the country in imitation of spenser three years after this his translation of aeschylus made its appearance in a quarto volume and has ever since been reprinted with the addition of notes in two volumes octavo of the excellence of this translation it is hardly possible to say too much many of the parts are so exquisitely beautiful as to leave us in doubt whether any poet we have ever heard of could have accomplished the task with greater success in      mr potter published vol i in quarto of his translation of euripides to which vol ii was added in the year following and in      his translation of sophocles was published in a quarto volume these lastmentioned versions are certainly upon the whole inferior to mr potters first production yet they are each of them excellent performances and far superior to those of our former translators mr wodhull and dr franklin beside these laborious works mr potter published in      an enquiry into some passages in dr johnsons lives of the poets a quarto pamphlet and in      a translation of the oracle concerning babylon and the song of exultation from isaiah chap xiii and xiv  in his weightiest character the translator of the greek tragedians we must again compliment mr potter on the very singular service which he has done to the literary world it was an undertaking which to many must have appeared too great for the life of man and considering the success with which so much labor has been accomplished considering also the amiable character which mr potter bears as a member of society we are surprised that he has not long ago attracted the notice of those who are able and willing to confer honors and preferments where they meet with peculiar

voluminous gentleman was some time ago a bookseller of the city of bath his first attempt at distinction consisted in reading passages of some of the most celebrated poets in public when he first assumed the character of an author his signature was courtney melmoth under which his first production in the year      was a quarto pamphlet of wretched stanzas entitled the tears of genius occasioned by the death of dr goldsmith in the year following mr courtney melmoth produced vols i and ii in duodecimo of liberal opinions upon animals man and providence with the history of benignus a

produced at drury lane and published by mr pratt with a dedication to the prince of wales since this time mr pratt has always prefixed his name to his productions in the year      he brought out a comedy at drury lane entitled the school for vanity which was perhaps rather capriciously condemned and two years afterward he published landscapes in verse a poem and four crown octavo volumes of miscellanies in which many of his former fugitive pieces were reprinted mr pratts next productions were the triumph of benevolence a poem occasioned by the design of erecting a monument to mr howard

be severely felt by the literary world as he joined to the accomplishments of the gentleman the erudition of the scholar soon afterward came a second paragraph as follows as no event of late has caused a more general than the supposed death of the ingenious mrpratt we are happy to have it in our power to assure his numerous admirers that he is as well as they can wish and what they will be delighted to hear busied in preparing his travels for the press  it is difficult to say which of mr pratts literary productions have been most approved by the above list of them the reader will observe that he may say with dr johnson he has written his share beside these we only recollect a farce entitled joseph andrews which was acted at drury lane in      for mr bensleys benefit but never printed of his verses we think the triumph of benevolence the best upon the whole the stationers and printers must thank him for his excellent custom but if he ever wrote for same he seems mightily to

pulpit discourses his political pamphlets and his private conversation were well known to be highly inimical to the government of his country and especially to her ecclesiastical constitution but his declamatory vehemence and the indecency of his conduct to the neighboring clergy caused him to be viewed by the lower classes in birmingham as a turbulent seditious man and in july      a flame which

minds of the populace and the fabrication of this paper was ignorantly attributed to dr priestley attached to the constitution of their country they resolved to inflict the heaviest vengeance upon the man who dared thus to insult them and the consequences were dreadful indeed for some days birmingham was a miserable scene of popular fury houses were pillaged meeting houses burned and no bounds could have been put to the fury of the enraged mob had it not been for the wise dispassionate conduct of the neighboring nobility and gentry who at length succeeded in restoring peace to the distracted town dr priestley suffered severely his house his library with numerous unpublished manuscripts his laboratory and valuable philosophical apparatus were all destroyed part of the mob

though the historian seems well to understand the direct tendency of the doctors character and opinions the temper of the divine appears to much greater advantage than that of his antagonist  of the abilities of dr priestley none can hesitate to pronounce that they are of firstrate excellence his philosophical enquiries and publications claim the greatest distinction and have materially contributed to the advancement of science as an experimental philosopher he is perhaps the very first of his age he has also been a most industrious divine and had he proved as diligent in propagating truth as in disseminating error in establishing the gospel in the minds of men instead of shaking their belief in the doctrines of revelation perhaps few characters of the present century would have ranked higher as learned men or have been held in greater estimation on the contrary his political and theological writings must be pronounced to be fraught with principles the most destructive to the wellbeing of society it was a saying of dr johnson that they were calculated to unsettle every thing but to settle nothing the undaunted and unremitting constancy with which he has pursued the establishment of his speculative doctrines has done infinitely more than was to be wished toward giving popularity to his metaphysical and theological sentiments and if their apprehended effect has fortunately been counteracted it is probably owing to their violence rather than to any other cause the pillars of revelation says mr gibbon are shaken by those men who preserve the name without the substance of religion who indulge the license without the temper of philosophy  priestley rev timothy brother to the subject of the preceding article and a methodist minister he has published a

gifford a bartholomewfair farce indeed the same name is but too applicable to most of them upon the whole perhaps the dramatist is the best of mr reynolds dramatic productions but they all bear in every scene the badges of that corrupt and pitiful taste so lamentably but so strongly the characteristic of the age in which they were written we have already alas had but too frequent opportunity vide morton okeefe etc of expressing the concern we feel upon this occasion  reynolds henry revell esquire of grays inn son of the physician of the same name and member of trinity college cambridge this gentleman published in the year      a duodecimo volume which he entitled an address to the ladies from a young man this production by no means to the credit of the times be it said reached in a short time a second edition we will only add that the subject itself and more especially the indecent manner in which it is treated considering to whom it is addressed are unworthy of a writer who professes in his preface to have been lately studying mathematics and totally unworthy of an academic and a scholar  richards george ma fellow of oriel college oxford and a gentleman whose poetical talents have very considerable claims to distinction we believe that his first publication was his beautiful poem the aboriginal britons which was printed in      having been publicly recited at oxford during an act in consequence of a prize adjudged to its author the donation of an unknown person almost all the copies of the first impression of this masterly production were sold on the day

following and matilda or the dying penitent a poetical epistle published in a quarto pamphlet in      all of which are worthy of the author of the aboriginal britons if this gentleman shall prove duly

dictionary in two volumes folio to which was prefixed a dissertation on the language literature and manners of the eastern nations which was afterward printed separately in an octavo volume these

some distinction he is a man of taste and information but more to be commended for his acuteness than for his goodbreeding or his candor we believe his first publication was an anonymous quarto pamphlet in      of observations on the three first volumes of wartons history of english poetry which is an ingenious but at the same time one of the most illiberal productions we ever recollect to have seen mr rittson has also written anonymously three sets of remarks on the editors of shakspeare the first on mr stevens edition in      entitled remarks critical and illustrative on the text and notes of the last edition of shakspeare an octavo volume the second on mr reeds republication of that edition entitled the quip modest etc and the third on mr malones edition entitled  cursory criticisms etc the last of these is particularly illiberal in the year      he published with his name a wellexecuted translation with notes of the hymn to venus which has been ascribed to homer  the most distinguished character of mr rittson in his literary capacity is that of a judicious and intelligent compiler he published in the year      a select collection of english songs in three octavo volumes and has since that time edited an octavo volume of ancient songs from the time of king henry iii to the revolution an octavo volume of pieces of ancient popular poetry the english anthology a

devoted his attention with considerable success to the education of youth he published in the year      a tract of some merit entitled thoughts upon creation etc and two years afterward a thin octavo volume of poetical attempts the lookeron a periodical paper is dedicated to this gentleman by his son the author as an humble expression of his love and a still humbler tribute to manly virtue and unblemished integrity of life  roberts william esquire am fas of grays inn a gentleman whose literary seize are of very singular distinction and excellence he is the younger son of the subject of the preceding article was educated at corpus christi college oxford became a fellow of that society and was originally destined to the church which he afterward relinquished in favor of the law while at the university he obtained about the year      a prize for an essay on refinement which is one of the most masterly and elegant performances we almost ever recollect to have seen a few copies only of it were printed for the sake of private distribution mr roberts was also about that time a frequent contributor to the english review which was then certainly the bestconducted literary journal of the day and we believe he also published at the university an account of the oxford marbles in a duodecimo volume on leaving college he traveled for a short time on the continent and soon after his return commenced the publication of his excellent periodical paper the lookeron no i made its appearance in folio march  0th      the first twentyfive numbers were published on tuesdays and saturdays then after an interval of a few months it was continued on saturdays only and the last number was dated december   st      of the few contributors to this work mr beresford vide that name was the chief the second edition was printed in three duodecimo volumes and the third in four with some additions  very few indeed are in our opinion the instances which the english language affords of such finished specimens of essaywriting as are to be found in the lookeron the taste knowledge and ingenuity the sterling wit the happy raillery and the elegance of style with which these papers are conceived and written must ever characterise them as very firstrate performances of their kind while we know of no instance in particular in which a writer has displayed greater power over the feelings of his readers than in the beautiful and natural story of eugenio the reigning whims and follies of the age have never in our opinion since the days of addison been combated by the weapons of wit and reason with equal address and if the urbanity of criticism the elegance of morality and the playfulness of allusion which so remarkably distinguish the spectator be any where to be looked for since those days it must be in the lucubrations of simon olivebranch the rambler is assuredly the only periodical paper which can by any means aspire to the rank of these two productions and let none incautiously detract from the solid merit of that performance it has been truly called a body of ethics and to give it the highest possible praise it is a work whose profundity and whose composition are worthy of the great logician and lexicographer whom it owns for its author yet the charms with which addison instructs have gained him with most readers a preference to his great successor and the lookeron with a perfect originality of his own and with the becoming character of a writer of his own time is surely the spectator rather than the rambler of his day  it is a singular and a melancholy consideration that this work although favorably received has not experienced from the public that extraordinary distinction to which its extraordinary merit certainly entitled it for let it be read for our amusement for the improvement of our taste or for the greater sakes of our religion and our morals it shall be found to answer all our purposes with superior excellence some blame has perhaps been justly bestowed upon the author for an occasional excess in the amplification of his subjects and for an overwrought nicety of style too like what may be called a false refinement in writing yet these are but as dust in the balance it is not to these causes we fear that we are to look for the evil but to the tastelessness and insipidity of the larger portion of that shallow age in which the work was written melancholy indeed is the reflection that the good taste which we once undoubtedly possessed should so far have forsaken us as to neglect such distinguished merit  we shall conclude this article by applying to mr roberts the language used by one of mr burkes political adversaries when speaking of that transcendent writer alleging as our reason for so doing that we know of no living author to whom we think them more properly applicable he is a writer of the most splendid and unequalled powers the fascination and magic of whose eloquence cannot be withstood his imperial fancy has

conduct of that queen on grounds somewhat different from those of her former apologists this history cannot however upon the whole be said to rank with the best productions which the subject has

accomplishments married lord king then lord high chancellor of great britain mrs robinson was born in the college green bristol received the early part of her education in that city and at the age of fifteen married her present husband who was then a student in lincolns inn shortly afterward she thought it proper to exercise her talents on the stage and came out in juliet under the particular patronage of the duchess of devonshire on the  0th of december      for three seasons she continued to perform the parts of lady macbeth imogen rosalind cordelia ophelia viola palmira the irish widow perdita etc with great applause and having in the latter character attracted by her elegance and beauty the notice of a certain distinguished florizel she quitted the stage at a time when she was rising rapidly in the estimation of the public  of the literary productions of mrs robinson we believe the first was a small octavo volume of poems published in      two years afterward she wrote captivity a poem and celadon and lydia a tale which were printed together in a quarto pamphlet dedicated to her patroness the duchess of devonshire in      she brought out a farce entitled the lucky escape for her own benefit at drury lane none of these productions appear to have attracted that notice by which the later writings of their fair author have been so remarkably distinguished and her pen appears to have been unemployed till about the year      when she figured in the newspaper the world under the signature anna matilda for an account of the correspondence with delia crusca kept up from poetical sympathy at intervals for two years we refer the reader to our memoir of mr merry and shall only observe that we think her poems in the collection entitled the british album certainly claim the second place in point of merit mrs robinson also produced many pieces about this time in the oracle under the signatures laura maria julia laura oberon etc in    0 she published a poem inscribed to mr merry under the title ainsi va le monde and in the year following produced her elegant octavo volume of poems which was honored by a very splendid list of subscribers the poetical productions with which mrs robinson has favored the world since that publication are a monody to the memory of sir joshua reynolds sight the cavern of woe and solitude published together in a quarto pamphlet modern manners a poem by horace juvenal a monody to the memory of the late queen of france and vol ii of poems in which some of these pieces are reprinted in the year      mrs robinson published her first novel vancenza and has since that time written the widow angelina and hubert de sevrac novels and the sicilian lover a tragedy several popular pamphlets have also been attributed to her pen  the beauty of mrs robinsons poetry has obtained her the dignified appellation of the english sappho she is sometimes feeble and sometimes degenerates into a false taste but the poetic imagery the feeling and tenderness the warmth and elegance and above all the delicacy of expression which breathe through her poems can seldom fail to lay her reader under a bountiful contribution of applause as a novelwriter we think this lady much less successful her vancenza speedily reached a third edition because it was the work of mrs robinson but surely in falls greatly short of many of her countrywomen this as well as in her subsequent attempts she in the talent of pleasing her tragedy the sicilian lover is a very favorable specimen indeed of her talent in that line of composition

meetings of freemasons illuminati and reading societies collected from good authorities this volume has been favorably received and although too hasty a performance for a work of so much consequence is well entitled both from its subject and by its authenticity to the serious attention of every reader it arrives at the same remarkable conclusion as the celebrated memoirs of the abbe barruel illustrating the history of jacobinism though the authors were perfectly unconnected with each other and pursued their enquiries in very different ways it has raised we are sorry for such an appearance a considerable clamor and enmity against the professor though it was written as we are fully convinced from the best of motives we cannot conclude this article without observing that the principles and honest zeal which professor robison has displayed upon this occasion are highly creditable to him and merit the warmest acknowledgements from society in general we have understood that he designs to favor the world at some time or other with a life of sir isaac newton a work much wanted from a man of science and for the due execution of which the professor is peculiarly wellqualified  rogers samuel esquire a partner in the bankinghouse of messrs welsh and co and a poet of very considerable distinction he is a son of the mr rogers who was the unsuccessful candidate

abovementioned work does the highest credit to his literary talents and entitles him to rank with the very first writers on european history the circumstances attending this publication are not among the least singular in the annals of literature the full distinct and accurate idea afforded us with such genius and learning of the interesting subject treated in these volumes is the result of discoveries made in the literature of one of the most polite and learned nations of europe by a foreigner who had never visited that country by a gentleman who was not courting literature in academical bowers but devoting his time to an active and a laborious profession mr clarke a banker of liverpool and son of the late banker of the same name a gentleman of very extensive information and the intimate friend of mr roscoe had paid a visit to italy and had fixed his winter residence at florence it was through the assiduity of this gentleman that mr roscoe obtained his large stock of original and interesting information as well as the beautiful poems of lorenzo de medici with copies of which as well as with beautiful and exact translations of them he has enriched his work the originals of which are deposited in the laurentian library although the former editiors appear not to have had the slightest information respecting them the work made its first appearance in      in two volumes quarto under the title the life of lorenzo de medici called the magnificent such we have understood was the authors diffidence of its success that the first impression consisted of only two hundred and fifty copies so small a number disappeared very soon after publication and although the work was printed in the expensive style and sold at a proportional price it has seen three editions even in times so unpropitious as the present nor as every reader can foretell has it obtained early popularity without the prospect of a lasting reputation it holds the place which it fills in the history of europe by too lawful a tenure ever to renounce its privileges  the celebrated and excellent letter to mr pit by jasper wilson has been improperly attributed to mr roscoe it is the production of his friend dr james currie of liverpool and we believe that the largest share he had in that publication was a perusal of the original copy and some little assistance he may have given

mr roughs hopes that his tragedy has some claim to the honors of a legitimate drama we must beg leave to say of his volume that the dedication is absurd the four first acts of the tragedy woefully dull and the sonnets which follow pretty rather than otherwise he is also the writer of the poetry in the monthly magazine signed w r graysinn mr rough has announced his intention of publishing a

intention of also favoring the public with an elucidation of the litany communionoffice and other offices of the church  sheridan richard brinsley esquire mp this celebrated character is of a family which during the greater part of the present century has been eminent for genius and learning his grandfather was the intimate friend and favorite of doctor swift the companion of his leisure the sharer of his confidence and the imitator of his wit his father was the corrector of the english accent and was acknowledged to be the best declaimer in the english language of his day he was for a considerable time manager of the dublin theater and being compelled by the animosity of party to quit that situation acquired same and profit in london as an actor and as a lecturer the mother of mr sheridan could also boast a distinguished literary reputation obtained by several plays novels and other pieces of considerable merit  mr sheridan was born at quilea near dublin in the year      at the age of six years his father then compelled to quit his native country brought him to england and placed him at harrow school under the care of dr sumner who was at that time the headmaster here mr sheridan contracted a friendship with dr parr then one of the undermasters which has ever since subsisted between them it does not appear that he was ever a member of either of the universities but the law being his destination was entered of the middle temple at the age of eighteen years he translated from the greek in association with a friend the epistles of aristaenetus and also about that time printed several pieces which are known only to his intimate friends and among which we believe was an answer to the celebrated heroic epistle to sir william chambers residing for some time at bath he became acquainted with miss elizabeth linley daughter of the late patentee of drury lane of that name this lady celebrated no less in her day for her mental than for her personal accomplishments was highly distinguished at that time as a public singer and a part of her story very honorable to herself relative to a proposal of marriage is commemorated by foot under the character of miss linnet in his comedy entitled the maid of bath not long after this affair mr sheridan made honorable proposals to her and was engaged on her account in a duel with a captain matthews which was very singular for the courage ferocity and inveterate resentment displayed by the parties in      his suit was crowned with success and though his lady brought him little or no fortune it has been supposed that his subsequent figure in the world has been in some degree owing to this marriage he was now in his twentysecond or twentythird year and even at this early period discovered that pride and dignity of mind which though not always desirable companions in the commerce of life are mostly characteristic of a generous spirit and a true genius for notwithstanding his narrow circumstances and the distance at which he was then removed from those brilliant prospects which he afterward had in view he would not allow mrs sheridan to engage herself at any place of public entertainment  depending on his own talents alone for support mr sheridan first turned his thoughts to dramatic composition and in january      brought out at covent garden theater his comedy the rivals this piece as it was originally played nearly doubled in length the generality of theatrical performances it suffered greatly on the first night from the severity of the audience and with difficulty obtained a second hearing several causes conspired to produce this effect among which in justice to mr sheridan must be mentioned the miserable manner in which some of the performers mr lee in particular acted their parts being however new molded by the author it was received with considerable applause and has continued a favorite with the public this play abounds in character and situation yet though it bears indisputable marks of the fertility of the authors genius it is certainly far from a perfect composition the character of mrs malaprop who is distinguished from the ordinary run of illiterate pretenders by the mere circumstance of her pronouncing hard words correctly but using them in an improper sense instead of murdering the words themselves as is usually the case is surely illconceived and unnatural the idea of acres with his newfangled oaths always swearing by objects appropriate to the subject of which he is treating seems an equal violation of probability and there appears to run through the piece an endeavor to give character and originality which is always built upon affected circumstances and not upon experience and knowledge of human nature when mr sheridan published this comedy he acknowldged his youth and inexperience and adopted the error of dreading imitation asserting in his preface that on subjects on which the mind has been much informed invention is slow of exerting itself yet it has always happened in some degree to those writers who think that the want of information will assist their invention that they have incurred the very censure they were anxious to avoid and have exhibited as new what is stale and hackneyed and what a more intimate acquaintance with their subject would have taught them to reject in this year he also produced st patricks day a farce which was originally represented for the benefit of mr clinch who seems to have been favored with it in consequence or his representation of the irishman in the rivals in which he greatly excelled mr lee  in the following year mr sheridan enriched the english drama with his celebrated comic opera the duenna the success of this piece was beyond all former example the beggars opera which had all the wits and half the nobility of england for its supports ran sixtythree nights in one season the duenna seventyfive the satire of this piece is beautiful and poignant the flashes of wit are perpetual and always genuine while the songs are characterised by that onction that ripeness and mellowness of expression which is probably the grand secret of songwriting this piece did not reach the press by the authors consent till the year       but even the merit of the duenna was thrown into comparative oblivion on the appearance in the following year of the school for scandal no dramatic production ever equalled this celebrated piece in success it can receive no honor from additional praise nor is it likely to be injured by the severest critical examination character it is true is not the fort even of this greatest production of our author yet the plot is so natural the mirror held up so true the incidents follow with such ease and grace the dialogue is so chaste and lively the wit so brilliant and stirling and every thing is so exquisitely finished and so happily conveyed that our entertainment is unbounded and we can never enough applaud our mirth this piece the policy as we suppose of our earliest theaters being on this occasion revived has never lawfully reached the press though some editions of it have been printed in ireland from a smuggled copy and sold here  in      mr sheridan brought out at drury lane the camp a dramatic entertainment intended to compliment the duchess of devonshire which has never been printed and in the following year the critic or a tragedy rehearsed a farce which has reached the press the critic is distinguished by that genuine wit which has so often characterised the productions of its author and is a piece which has obtained the frequently repeated applauses of the public its first act has particular merit in the character of sir fretful plagiary which as is well known is a satire upon mr richard cumberland a gentleman of mild and amiable manners but who is probably in some degree subject to the weakness here ridiculed and who had been so illadvised or so unfortunate as to give offense to mr sheridan the two last acts which consist of a mock tragedy have as much merit as their subject will allow under the twofold disadvantage of being barren in itself and of having been anticipated by the popular comedy of the rehearsal the author of the rehearsal had the advantage of writing in an era of false taste and of having for the topic of his ridicule the absurdities of so great a genius as mr dryden the errors of more modern tragedies were too evanescent for satire and mr sheridan in order to be intelligible was obliged sometimes to have recourse to the best passages of shakspeare now it is true that our mirth may be excited by a travesty of homer or virgil but we never can applaud the author to the pen of mr sheridan are also to be attributed a trip to scarborough a comedy as altered from vanburghs relapse a monody to the memory of mr garrick which would have reflected luster upon an inferior genius but added nothing to our admiration of mr sheridan the prologue to captain ayscoughs tragedy semiramis which is a beautiful piece of poetry and several more highly elegant trifles which are to be found in different collections of fugitive pieces the public has also for many years been flattered with the hopes of receiving from the same source the foresters a comic opera and affectation a comedy but from the length of their delay we may be led to despair of their appearance  it was in the year      when mr garrick retired from the stage that mr sheridan purchased in association with mr linley his fatherinlaw and with dr ford one moiety of the property of drury lane theater to which they soon afterward added the other moiety mr sheridans share of this property is said to have been more than a half and for some years he continued the acting manager of the theater his carelessness and inattention to the interests of this situation were very conspicuous and the credit of old drury certainly lost a sturdy prop in her celebrated garrick but having completed every thing with regard to the stage to which his ambition could aspire mr sheridan turned the activity of his mind to another object and was encouraged by the friendship of mr fox to offer himself a candidate for representing the town of stafford in the parliament which was summoned to meet october  0th    0 the new life into which his success introduced him exalted his views and by engaging his talents in the concerns of his country has had a fatal effect on his dramatic pursuits yet it must be acknowledged a remarkable circumstance that a writer should so soon have reached the highest pinnacle of excellence in a path so arduous of ascent and that he should then have relinquished it for ever  mr sheridan did not inherit from nature every advantage toward making him a great public speaker his voice in particular was neither strong harmonious nor of considerable compass he had however the benefit of a remarkably clear and accurate articulation and was early initiated in ideas of public speaking by his father the difficulties under which he labored were conquered by unwearied perseverance and by the exercise of his voice on trifling topics and ordinary occasions this conquest was not completed when he was appointed in      under secretary of state in the department of mr fox or when in the year following he was promoted to the place of secretary to the treasury under the duke of portland in the session of      he made a celebrated speech upon the fourth of the twenty irish propositions and in the following year upon a motion brought forward by himself upon the subject of finance of the former of these speeches a tolerable report was published and has been inserted in the parliamentary register but mr sheridan rose to his greatest height as a speaker in      when he opened the third article of impeachment in the house of commons against mr hastings upon the subject of the punishment inflicted by him for the rebellion of the princesses of oude this speech was five hours and a half in length and those who heard it seemed to think that no language could do justice to its wit its sublimity and its pathos it is hardly necessary to add that mr sheridan has for many years been one of the most distinguished leaders of the opposition as an elegant scholar we may safely say he has not a superior in the senate of his country and however different the sensations may be with which his character will impress some of those who contemplate him as a genius and as a man the urbanity of his behavior in that assembly and the uniformly classical elegance and grace of his diction must command the admiration of all  not many years after the loss of his first wife mr sheridan married in      miss ogle daughter of the dean of winchester about this time he attempted to dispose of his property in the theater but though he sold a part of it he still retains the larger share  sheridan charles francis esquire this gentleman is an elder brother of the subject of the preceding article and was a few years ago under secretary of state for the war department in the kingdom of ireland and also a member of the parliament of that kingdom he published in      in an octavo volume a history of the late revolution in sweden having been secretary to the british envoy in that kingdom at the time of the revolution this is a very masterly performance mr sheridan also wrote several pamphlets which were received with applause upon the ministerial side of the question during the former dissentions of ireland one of them was entitled letters of a dungannon volunteer respecting the expediency of a parliamentary reform in the year      mr sheridan published in london an essay upon the true principles of civil liberty and of free

shakspeare than could be collected from the strictures of the partial and jealous voltaire and at geneva lettres dun voyageur anglois in which the words of horace purpureus late qui splendeat unus et alter assuitur pannus are remarkably exemplified in the following year mr sherlock published in london and paris nouvelles lettres dun voyageur anglois in an octavo volume both of these volumes of letters were afterward translated into english soon after his return in      he published letters on several subjects in two duodecimo volumes and four years afterward a fragment on shakspeare

was finished in six weeks and on its improved plan in ten books was almost entirely recomposed during the time of printing the poetical powers displayed in this poem are of a very superior kind and notwithstanding a little occasional negligence its merit is such as unquestionably to entitle its author to the name or poet yet mr southey at the same time must be said to have done infinite injustice to his extraordinary talents in allowing the fervor of youth to hurry him in such a manner through a work of genius so singulary arduous in      mr southey published a duodecimo volume of

account he has published of the embassy to china this long expected work made its appearance in august      in two volumes quarto accompanied by a folio volume of plates under the title an authentic account of the embassy from the king of great britain to the emperor of china such was the public curiosity that although it was printed in a very expensive style and the impression consisted of a large number of copies every one was subscribed for long before the day of publication an octavo edition of it in three volumes has been published since its first appearance the account was taken chiefly from the papers of lord macartney the ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary of sir erasmus gower commander of the expedition and of other gentlemen in the several departments of the embassy though it may be said to contain little additional information respecting china to what was already to be found in the writings of duhalde grosier and others who have traveled in that country it must be confessed that sir george staunton enjoyed peculiar advantages for describing with accuracy the physical as well as moral state of the vast empire so remarkable an instance of the necessary abilities and opportunities to collect information and of strict authenticity in reporting it as concurred in the case of the gentlemen who accompanied this embassy can very rarely happen it is true that in these volumes utility is never sacrificed to pleasure nor instruction to amusement veracity candor and modesty mark them in every page but the authors excess of precaution against egotism

dodsons translation of isaiah which were answered by mr dodson and produced very favorable testimonies to the learning of the doctor and to the candor of his adversary the subsequent literary

work whose title attracted a degree of curiosity which its contents were but ill able to gratify the author of the pursuits of literature has thought it proper to dignify this publication with the character of a work of labor and of general utility digested from original writers with judgment and with an upright virtuous heart in a pleasing and instructive manner a sentence unworthy of him who passed it to the goodness of the writers heart we have nothing to object but surely as a philosopher he is even below mediocrity had not the name of a gentleman and a man of fortune appeared in the title we should have pronounced the work an arrant instance of bookmaking as it is we can only allow the last volume to be at all worthy of a philosophical pen the remaining five are trash the babblings of an infant in natural knowledge among many to notice one particular instance a writer who adopts such a theory of the tides as mr sulivan has adopted can either not understand newtons theory and therefore must be totally unequal to such a work as the view of nature or if he does understand it shows by the choice he has made that he is utterly incompetent to his undertaking in point of philosophical reasoning and judgment how trite yet how little heeded is the good old maxim  sumite materiam vestris qui scribitis aequam viribus et versate diu quid far recusent quid valiant humeri

volume of travels through spain which appeared in      four years afterward he published vol i in quarto of his celebrated travels in the two sicilies to which vol ii was added two years afterward both of these works have been reprinted in octavo the first in two and the last in four volumes the learning and ingenuity of mr swinburne are too well known to require an additional panegyric from us the warmth and animation of his descriptions discover an imagination highly susceptible to every beauty of nature or of art and if he have a fault it is that he is too apt to relinquish simplicity for

and miscellaneous poems in three duodecimo volumes many of which had appeared singly at different times several years before that period the first of them an ode to the warlike genius of great britain was printed in      and has gained its author considerable credit had mr tasker duly estimated his talents he would have confined himself to excursions like this for mediocrity is the highest station to which any dissimilar poetical attempts of his can be said to have attained since the abovementioned collection he has published arviragus a tragedy never performed whose subject is the contest between the ancient britons and the romans terminated by the marriage of arviragus with the daughter of the emperor claudius to his select odes is added a series of letters containing much miscellaneous matter and among the rest proofs of the anatomical accuracy of homer in his description of the wounds suffered by the heroes in the illiad mr tasker is at present employed as we understand on a history of physiognomy from the time of aristotle to that of lavater in which the stagyrites knowledge of physiognomy is to be illustrated in the same manner as the anatomical

national debt and a second letter to the same on a national bank the chart and scale of truth by which to find the cause of error indisputably the masterpiece of its author was read before the university of oxford at the lecture founded by mr bampton and is not completed in the two volumes already published it is a work highly creditable to the learning and accurate reasoning of its author who appears to have written it with a laudable zeal for academical reformation and for the general advancement of knowledge its leading object is to assist the philosophical enquirer in distinguishing what he can know from what he cannot know and by marking the modes and degrees of human knowledge to furnish a general scale or common measure by which we may ascertain the particular nature and relative force of every kind of truth it is calculated in short to lead men to think and to judge for themselves and not in the thoughts and opinions of others if this book can be said to have a fault it seems to be that it is without that finish and polish which to so important a design appear peculiarly requisite  tattersall rev wd ma vicar of wotton under edge gloucestershire and chaplain to the

bay for the conveyance of convicts an octavo pamphlet and has since that time written a complete account of the settlement of port jackson in new south wales the latter of these productions takes up the history of the settlement where the former drops it and brings it down to the end of the year      when major tench left the place he has contributed largely by his inland travels to the knowledge which we have of the country about port jackson but he is perhaps amenable on the score of exhibiting the dark side of the picture an octavo volume of highly interesting letters written by major tench in france to a friend in london was published in      while he was of his majestys ship alexander that vessel was captured by a french squadron and these letters were written between november      and may      the air of truth and manliness which pervades them and the entertaining manner in which they are written characterise them as peculiarly pleasing  thelwall john this conspicuous character after a very inferior education was articled to an attorney and early in life exhibited that restless unsatisfied turbulent disposition by which he has of late peculiarly distinguished himself upon the publication of paines rights of man mr thelwall was one of the first to display a zealous attachment to his principles and he soon afterward began to deliver a course of lectures of an inflammatory tendency at beaufort buildings in the strand here evening after evening he thundered out philippics against the constitution of his country with the vehemence of an impassioned demagogue to the admiration of the vilest refuse of the metropolis in the year      these discourses were interrupted by the hand of government and the orator was conveyed to the tower to take his trial together with hardy took and some other unruly citizens during his confinement mr thelwall wrote some poems which were published after his release having been tried at the sessions house old bailey in november      and acquitted with the other prisoners his subsequent behavior has been no less marked by its mischievous tendency than it was previously to his imprisonment under the semblance of illustrating ancient history he has continued his political lectures and has transferred his pernicious school to different parts of the country at yarmouth he was some time ago interrupted in a very serious manner in the midst of his oratory by the abrupt entrance of a body of sailors who were heated with liquor and who actuated by an imiprudent zeal committed several unjustifiable acts of violence upon the auditory he also experienced some riotous opposition at lynn and at wisbeach  as an author mr thelwall made his first appearance in      when he published orlando and almeyda a legendary tale in the manner of goldsmith and also poems on various subjects in two duodecimo volumes the touching simplicity which is characteristic of true poetry is in these wretched pieces supplied by a plain prosaic diction which is as remote as possible from it after this unfortunate attempt mr thelwall did not seek the press again till the year      when no i of his political lectures made its appearance in the following year he published the natural and constitutional right of britons to annual parliaments universal suffrage and the freedom of popular association the speech which he intended to have delivered on his trial his subsequent productions have been sober reflections on the seditious and inflammatory letter of the rt hon edmund burke to a noble lord

discoveries in the construction of chimneys and was enabled to point out means which have since been successfully put in practice in this country also of increasing the heat and at the same time decreasing the quantity of fuel count rumford moreover introduced manufactures into munich until then unknown and was the mean of familiarizing the use of the potatoe in germany the honors which he has received from his new master the elector are of the highest distinction  the publications of count rumford have been confined to his experimental essays political oeconomical and philosophical

never been prosecuted farther the part which dr thorp has committed to the public cannot be said to be a very favorable specimen of his appropriate talents for such an undertaking his commentary is for the most part a translation of the notes by the jesuits and in the management of fluxions a deficiency of knowledge and of address is apparent throughout beside this publication dr thorp has printed two single sermons one preached at the assizes at newcastle in      and the other before the university of cambridge in       throsby john an intelligent antiquarian who has devoted his

very liberally accused each other of roguery and swindling about an important affair of a welsh poney and a packet of foul linen mr horn also entered the lists with the celebrated junius a contest in

and in the year following an oration which he delivered at a numerous meeting of the freeholders of middlesex at mileend assembly room march  0th    0 to consider of an address remonstrance and petition to his majesty it is probable that the manner in which he had embroiled himself in political dispute and the conspicuous and improper part which he had acted were his inducements to the resignation of his gown since that time he has made himself a most conspicuous champion of republicanism in the year      he was tried for a libel in having charged the kings troops with murdering the american soldiery at lexington and bunkers hill he subpoenaed lord george sackville and several of the kings ministers who did not think it proper to answer his summons and having undertaken to plead his own cause he delivered a speech three hours in length full of ingenuity argument and shrewdness this speech printed in the state trials is highly creditable to his talents as a constitutional lawyer  mr horn was at this time preparing himself for the bar but objections were raised to exclude him from the profession he had chosen and in several attempts which he made to address his old audiences of freeholders and others he was constantly overborne and silenced the native energy of his mind enabled him to find a consolation amid these disappointments in the pursuits of literature and having applied himself to the study of universal grammar the first fruit of his labor appeared in a letter to mr john dunning lord ashburton published in      this pamphlet now become very scarce is the skeleton of his subsequent celebrated work on this subject to be noticed hereafter and it is said dr johnson thought so well of it that he told a friend if he ever printed a new edition of his

sure basis it has been highly admired and is conceived by the generality of its readers to have totally demolished the system of mr james harris of salisbury who had long shared in profusion the

success he amused himself upon the hustings with deriding sir alan gardner before an ignorant unprincipled mob  however unpopular mr took may have made himself with the better part of mankind by the distinction he has aimed at as a philosopher of the new sect he is certainly entitled to the credit of firstrate abilities his style is clear and nervous and the acuteness of his intellect has seldom been equalled as a scholar and philologist his fame will probably live while our language exists and even as a politician it has been said for him that he is one of the few of his day whose conduct

government in reply to mr lock an octavo volume the boldness and spirit which he displayed as a political writer at one time brought the credit of his understanding considerably into question but his early argument in favor of a separation from america and his reasonings to show that no material disadvantage would arise from it were so far confirmed by experience and his principles in favor of

diligence we cannot doubt from these specimens that he will one day rank highly in the world for his literary credit if the volume can be said to have a fault it is an occasional appearance of

performance his edition of popes illiad and odyssey a very complete and elegant publication and his edition of lucretius upon the large paper the handsomest book we almost ever recollect to have seen he has also written beside the pieces already enumerated a very masterly essay on the origin of alphabetical characters which was read to the literary and philosophical society of manchester at two successive meetings was the more immediate occasion of his being elected an honorary member of that society and has been inserted in the new annual register and in the scotch encyclopaedia it is likewise to be found with additions and improvements in the memoirs of his life mr wakefield is also an occasional contributor to the monthly and gentlemans magazines to the former he not long ago sent two letters particularly remarkable in which he endeavors to do away a prejudice of considerable strength and standing respecting the elegance of the style of hume  in contemplating mr wakefields general character as an author the first and highest commendation is due to his remarkable industry it is this active principle that has enabled him with a repectable share of talent to serve the truest interests of useful letters with far greater effect than has commonly fallen to the lot of firstrate genius his knowledge of greek and roman authors is extensive and accurate and as a critic he possesses a spirit most penetrating and ardent as an emendator he is frequently ingenious but certainly for the greater part too bold his latin style as he himself acknowledges savours more of the expressive energy of quintilian than of the magnificent volubility of cicero it is not a little surprising and particularly to be lamented for the sake of mr wakefields credit that with such peculiar faculties for the enjoyment of classical studies he should ever have forsaken that flowery path to share the grovelling walks of writers infinitely his inferiors relinquishing the loftiest distinctions of literary character for a pitiful display of partyspirit or peculiarity of opinion some of his controversial writings theological as well as political are peculiarly indecent for their violence and illiberality and his disposition appears upon these occasions to such disadvantage that his unpopularity seems a necessary consequence his english style is always manly and graceful and sometimes peculiarly elegant and energetic most readers will however object to his superabundant use of classical quotations his numerous writings have for the greater part experienced an indifferent reception and some of them particuliarly the earlier ones have been severely handled by the critics of their day  wakefield daniel esquire author of a letter to thomas pain in reply to his decline and

that during his residence there he was induced upon a prospect of important preferment to assume the clerical function but that being disappointed in his views he resigned that office before his return to england and has never since resumed it on his arrival here he pursued his original profession for several years but at last relinquished it entirely it is to be recorded to the credit of dr

ireland few indeed have been the writings which have succeeded in commanding so large a share of attention as the detached pieces of mr peter pindar such was the demand for them that a certain number of the london booksellers agreed to allow him two hundred pounds per annum for the exclusive privilege of selling his works they are characterised by a species of humor which though not elegant and tasteful is not destitute of nature and is irresistible in its power of exciting laughter we consider bozzy and piozzi the lousiad and pindariana as the best among them but have never contemplated the character of this writer without a mixture of surprise and concern that such talents and seize as his writings discover him to possess should never have been applied to better purposes than to a iudicrous display of his contempt of all decent respect and to the composition of such trifles as must inevitably perish with the age in which they were written  walcott john esquire this gentleman

in the literary world was in some measure disappointed on its appearance it is one of the handsomest books which the modern elegance of typography has produced but it is deformed by marks of haste unpardonable in such an undertaking and the commentary is little more than a selection of the best of warburtons notes combined with the corresponding parts of the editors beforementioned essay yet

fifth volume of his chemical essays his lordship next published an assize sermon preached at cambridge in      which was followed by two sermons preached at the same place in the year      the publication of which first made him known beyond the precincts of the university one of them entitled the principles of the revolution vindicated delivered on the   th of may the other on the

on the other in the same year dr watson also published an apology for christianity a duodecimo volume consisting of a series of letters to mr gibbon which of all the answers made to the attacks of

excellent appendix in      as well as his most seasonable strong judicious and beautiful apology for the bible are peculiarly entitled to commendation  as a writer dr watson has united with almost unexampled grace the knowledge of a scholar with the liberality of a gentleman the warm piety of a true christian and the open manliness of a wellintending character it has been said perhaps with truth that he is not a stranger to the pride of rank that he is not deaf to the whispers of ambition and that he feels with anguish the mortification of disappointment he has moreover rendered himself not a little conspicuous by his opposition to the measures of administration yet whatever delinquencies his detractors may have discovered none can with truth deny that his deportment in the course of

of the question by the researches of mr goodal the acuteness of mr tytler and above all by the genius of dr gilbert stuart he found means to discover some new materials for the defense of his heroine
