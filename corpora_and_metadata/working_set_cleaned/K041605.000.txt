hermes next a closecontriving god her brows encircled with his serpent rod then plots and fair excuses filled her brain the views of breaking amorous vows for gain the price of favors the designing arts that aim at riches in contempt of hearts and for a comfort in the marriage life the little pilfring temper of a wife full on the fair his beams apollo flung and fond persuasion tipd her easy tongue he gave her words where oily flattery lays the pleasing colors of the art of praise and wit to scandal exquisitely prone which frets anothers spleen to cure its own those sacred virgins whom the bards revere tuned all her voice and shed a sweetness there to make her sense with double charms abound or make her lively nonsense please by sound to dress the maid the decent graces brought a robe in all the dies of beauty wrought and placed their boxes over a rich brocade where pictured loves on every cover played then spread those implements that vulcans art had framed to merit cythereas

woman rises now to reign new beauty blooms a beauty formed to fly new love begins a love produced to dye new parts distress the troubled scenes of life the fondling mistress and the ruling wife men born to labor all with pains provide women have time to sacrifice to pride they want the care of man their want they know and dress to please with heartalluring show the show prevailing for the sway contend and make a servant where they meet a friend thus in a thousand waxerected forts a loytering race the painful be supports from sun to sun from bank to bank he flies with honey loads his bag with wax his thighs fly where he will at home the race remain prune the silk dress and murmuring eat the gain yet here and there we grant a gentle bride whose temper betters by the fathers side unlike the rest that double humane care fond to relieve or resolute to share happy the man whom thus his stars advance the curse is general but the blessing chance thus sung the sisters while the gods admire their beauteous creature made for man in ire the young pandora she whom all contend to make too perfect not to gain her end then bid the winds that fly to breath the spring return to bear her on a gentle wing with wafting airs the winds obsequious blow and land the shining vengeance safe below a golden coffer in her hand she bore the present treacherous but the bearer more twas fraught with pangs for jove ordained above that gold should aid and pangs attend on love her gay descent the man perceived afar wondering he run to catch the falling star but so surpised as none but he can tell who loved so quickly and who loved so well over all his veins the wandering passion burns he calls her nymph and every nymph by turns her form to lovely venus he prefers or swears that venus must be such as hers she proud to rule yet strangely framed to teize neglects his offers while her airs she plays shoots scornful glances from the bended frown in brisk disorder trips it up and down then hums a careless tune to lay the storm and sits and blushes smiles and yields in form now take what jove designed she softly cried this box thy portion and my self thy bride fired with the prospect of the double charms he snatched the box and bride with eager arms unhappy man to whom so bright she shone the fatal gift her tempting self unknown the winds were silent all the waves asleep and heaven was traced upon the flattering deep but whilst he looks unmindful of a storm and thinks the water wears a stable form what dreadful din around his ears shall rise what frowns confuse his picture of the skies at first the creature man was framed alone lord of himself and all the world his own for him the nymphs in green forsook the woods for him the nymphs in blue forsook the floods in vain the satyrs rage the tritons rave they bore him heroes in the secret cave no care destroyed no sick disorder preyed no bending age his sprightly form decayed no wars were known no females heard to rage and poets tell us twas a golden age when woman came those ills the box confined burst furious out and poisoned all the wind from point to point from pole to pole they flew spread as they went and in the progress grew the nymphs regretting left the mortal race and altring nature wore a sickly face new terms of folly rose new states of care new plagues to suffer and to please the fair the days of whining and of wild intrigues commenced or finished with the breach of leagues the mean designs of welldissembled love the sordid matches never joined above abroad the labor and at home the noise mans double sufferings for domestic joys the curse of jealousy expense and strife divorce the public brand of shameful life the rivals sword the qualm that takes the fair disdain for passion passion in despair  these and a thousand yet unnamd we find ah fear the thousand yet unnamd behind thus on parnassus tuneful hesiod sung the mountain echoed and the valley rung the sacred groves a fixed attention show the crystal helicon forbore to flow the sky grew bright and if his verse be true the muses came to give the laurel too but what availed the verdant prize of wit if love swore vengeance for the tales he writ ye fair offended hear your friend relate what heavy judgment proved the writers fate though when it happened no relation clears it is thought in five or five and twenty years where dark and silent with a twisted shade the neighboring woods a native arbor made there often a tender pair for amorous play retiring toyd the ravished hours away a locrian youth the gentle troilus he a fair milesian kind evanthe she but swelling nature in a fatal hour betrayed the secrets of the conscious bower the dire disgrace her brothers count their own and track her steps to make its author known it chanced one evening it was the lovers day concealed in brakes the jealous kindred lay when hesiod wandering mused along the plain and fixed his seat where love had fixed the scene a strong suspicion strait possessed their mind for poets ever were a gentle kind but when evanthe near the passage stood flung back a doubtful look and shot the wood now take at once they cry thy due reward and urged with erring rage assault the bard his corpse the sea received the dolphins bore it was all the gods would do the corpse to shore methinks i view the dead with pitying eyes and see the dreams of ancient wisdom rise i see the muses round the body cry but hear a cupid loudly laughing by he wheels his arrow with insulting hand and thus inscribes the moral on the sand here hesiod lies ye future bards beware how far your moral tales incense the fair unlovd unloving twas his fate to bleed without his quiver cupid caused the deed he judged this turn of malice justly due and hesiod died for joys he never knew song when thy beauty appears in its graces and airs all bright as an angel new dropped from the sky at distance i gaze and am awed by my fears so strangely you dazzle my eye but when without art your kind thoughts you impart when your love runs in blushes through every vein when it darts from your eyes when it pants in your heart then i know youre a woman again there is a passion and pride in our sex she replied and thus might i gratify both i would do still an angel appear to each lover beside but still be a woman to you a song thyrsis a young and amorous swain saw two the beauties of the plain who both his heart subdue gay caelias eyes were dazzling fair sabinas easy shape and air with softer magic drew he haunts the stream he haunts the grove lives in a fond romance of love and seems for each to dye till each a little spiteful grown sabina caelias shape ran down and she sabinas eye their envy made the shepherd find those eyes which love could only blind so set the lover free no more he haunts the grove or stream or with a truelove knot and name engraves a wounded tree ah caelia sly sabina cried though neither love we are both denied now to support the sexs pride let either fix the dart poor girl says caelia say no more for should the swain but one adore that spite which broke his chains before would break the others heart song my days have been so wondrous free the little birds that fly with careless ease from tree to tree were but as blessed as i ask gliding waters if a tear of mine increased their stream or ask the flying gales if ever i lent one sigh to them but now my former days retire and i am by beauty caught the tender chains of sweet desire are fixed upon my thought ye nightingales ye twisting pines ye swains that haunt the grove ye gentle echoes breezy winds ye close retreats of love with all of nature all of art assist the dear design o teach a young unpracticd heart to make my nancy mine the very thought of change i hate as much as of despair nor ever covet to be great unless it be for her it is true the passion in my mind is mixed with soft distress yet while the fair i love is kind i cannot wish it less anacreontick when spring came on with fresh delight to cheer the soul and charm the sight while easy breezes softer rain and warmer suns salute the plain twas then in yonder piny grove that nature went to meet with love green was her robe and green her wreath wherever she trod twas green beneath wherever she turned the pulses beat with new recruits of genial heat and in her train the birds appear to match for all the coming year raised on a bank where daizys grew and vilets intermixed a blew she finds the boy she went to find a thousand pleasures wait behind aside a thousand arrows lie but all unfeatherd wait to fly when they met the dame and boy dancing graces idle joy wanton smiles and airy play conspired to make the scene be gay love paired the birds through all the grove and nature bid them sing to love sitting hopping fluttering sing and pay their tribute from the wing to fledge the shafts that idly lie and yet unfeatherd wait to fly it is thus when spring renews the blood they meet in every trembling wood and thrice they make the plumes agree and every dart they mount with three and every dart can boast a kind which suits each proper turn of mind from the towering eagles plume the generous hearts accept their doom shot by the peacocks painted eye the vain and airy lovers dye for careful dames and frugal men the shafts are speckled by the hen the pyes and parrots deck the darts when prattling wins the panting hearts when from the voice the passions spring the warbling finch affords a wing together by the sparrow stung down fall the wanton and the young and fledged by geese the weapons fly when others love they know not why all this as late i chanced to rove i learned in yonder waving grove and see says love who called me near how much i deal with nature here how both support a proper part she gives the feather i the dart then cease for souls averse to sigh if nature cross ye so do i my weapon there unfeatherd flies and shakes and shuffles through the skies but if the mutual charms i find by which she links you mind to mind they wing my shafts i poize the darts and strike from both through both your hearts anacreontick gay bacchus liking estcourts wine a noble meal bespoke us and for the guests that were to dine brought comus love and jocus the god near cupid drew his chair near comus jocus placed for wine makes love forget its care and mirth exalts a feast the more to please the sprightly god each sweet engaging grace put on some clothes to come abroad and took a waiters place then cupid named at every glass a lady of the sky while bacchus swore he would drink the lass and had it bumperhigh far comus tossed his brimmers ocr and always got the most jocus took care to fill him more wheneer he mist the toast they called and drank at every touch he filled and drank again and if the gods can take too much it is said they did so then gay bacchus little cupid stung by reckoning his deceits and cupid mocked his stammring tongue with all his staggring gaits and jocus drolld on comus ways and tales without a jest while comus called his witty plays but waggeries at best such talk soon set em all at odds and had i homers pen i would sing ye how they drunk like gods and how they fought like men to part the fray the graces fly who make em soon agree nay had the furies selves been nigh they still were three to three bacchus appeased raised cupid up and gave him back his bow but kept some darts to stir the cup where sack and sugar flow jocus took comus rosy crown and gayly wore the prize and thrice in mirth he pushed him down as thrice he strove to rise then cupid sought the myrtle grove where venus did recline and venus close embracing love they joined to rail at wine and comus loudly cursing wit rolled off to some retreat where boon companions gravely sit in fat unweildy state bacchus and jocus still behind for one fresh glass prepare they kiss and are exceeding kind and vow to be sincere but part in time whoever hear this our instructive song for though such friendships may be dear they cannot continue long fairy tale in the ancient english style in britains isle and arthurs days when midnight faeries dauncd the maze lived edwin of the green edwin i wis a gentle youth endowed with courage sense and truth though badly shaped he been his mountain back mote well be said to measure height against his head and lift it self above yet spite of all that nature did to make his uncouth form forbid this creature dared to love he felt the charms of ediths eyes nor wanted hope to gain the prize could ladies look within but one sir topaz dressed with art and if a shape could win a heart he had a shape to win edwin if right i read my song with slighted passion paced along all in the moony light twas near an old enchaunted court where sportive faeries made resort to revel out the night his heart was drear his hope was crossed twas late twas far the path was lost that reached the neighbortown with weary steps he quits the shades resolved the darkling dome he treads and drops his limbs adown but scant he lays him on the floor when hollow winds remove the door a trembling rocks the ground and well i ween to count aright at once an hundred tapers light on all the walls around now sounding tongues assail his ear now sounding feet approachen near and now the sounds increase and from the corner where he lay he sees a train profusely gay come pranckling over the place but trust me gentles never yet was dight a masquing half so neat or half so rich before the country lent the sweet perfumes the sea the pearl the sky the plumes the town its silken store now whilst he gazed a gallant dressed in flaunting robes above the rest with awful accent cried what mortal of a wretched mind whose sighs infect the balmy wind has here presumed to hide at this the swain whose venurous soul no fears of magic art control advanced in open sight nor have i cause of dreed he said who view by no presumption led your revels of the night twas grief for scorn of faithful love which made my steps unweeting rove amid the nightly dew it is well the gallant cries again we faeries never injure men who dare to tell us true exalt thy lovedejected heart be mine the task or ever we part to make thee grief resign now take the pleasure of thy chance whilst i with mab my partner dance be little mable thine he spoke and all a sudden there light music floats in wanton air the monarch leads the queen the rest their faerie partners found and mable trimly tript the ground with edwin of the green the dancing past the board was laid and siker such a feast was made as heart and lip desire withouten hands the dishes fly the glasses with a wish come nigh and with a wish retire but now to please the faerie king full every deal they laugh and sing and antic feats devise some wind and tumble like an ape and othersome transmute their shape in edwins wondering eyes till one at last that robin hight renowned for pinching maids by night has hent him up aloof and full against the beam he flung where by the back the youth he hung to spraul unneath the roof from thence reverse my charm he cries and let it fairly now suffice the gambol has been shown but oberon answers with a smile content thee edwin for a while the vantage is thine own here ended all the phantomeplay they smelt the fresh approach of day and heard a cock to crow the whirling wind that bore the crowd has clapped the door and whistled loud to warn them all to go then screaming all at once they fly and all at once the tapers die poor edwin falls to floor forlorn his state and dark the place was never wight in sike a case through all the land before but soon as dan apollo rose full jolly creature home he goes he feels his back the less his honest tongue and steady mind han rid him of the lump behind which made him want success with lusty livelyhed he talks he seems a dancing as he walks his story soon took wind and beauteous edith sees the youth endowed with courage sense and truth without a bunch behind the story told sir topaz moved the youth of edith erst approved to see the revel scene at close of eve he leaves his home and wends to find the ruined dome all on the gloomy plain as there he bides it so befell the wind came rustling down a dell a shaking seized the wall up spring the tapers as before the faeries bragly foot the floor and music fills the hall but certes sorely sunk with woe sir topaz sees the elphin show his spirits in him die when oberon cries a man is near a mortal passion cleeped fear hangs flagging in the sky with that sir topaz hapless youth in accents faultring ay for ruth entreats them pity grant for als he been a mister wight betrayed by wandering in the night to tread the circled haunt ah losell vile at once they roar and little skilled of faerie lore thy cause to come we know now has thy kestrell courage fell and faeries since a ly you tell are free to work thee woe then will who bears the wispy fire to trail the swains among the mire the caitive upward flung there like a tortoise in a shop he dangled from the chambertop where whilome edwin hung the revel now proceeds apace deffly they frisk it over the place they sit they drink and eat the time with frolic mirth beguile and poor sir topaz hangs the while till all the rout retreat by this the stars began to wink they skriek they fly the tapers sink and down ydrops the knight for never spell by faerie laid with strong enchantment bound a glade beyond the length of night chill dark alone adreed he lay till up the welkin rose the day then deemed the dole was over but wot ye well his harder lot his seely back the bunch has got which edwin lost before this tale a sybilnurse ared she softly strokd my youngling head and when the tale was done thus some are born my son she cries with base impediments to rise and some are born with none but virtue can it self advance to what the favorite fools of chance by fortune seemed designed virtue can gain the odds of fate and from it self shake off the weight upon the unworthy mind pervigilium veneris cras amet qui numquam amavit

my rising song with sacred fire ye tuneful nine ye sweet celestial quire from helicons imbowring height repair attend my labors and reward my prayer the dreadful toils of raging mars i write the springs of contest and the fields of fight how threatening mice advanced with warlike grace and waged dire combats with the croaking race not louder tumults shook olympus towers when earthborn giants dared immortal powers these equal acts an equal glory claim and thus the muse records the tale of fame once on a time fatigued and out of breath and just escaped the stretching claws of death a gentle mouse whom cats pursued in vain fled swiftoffoot across the neighboring plain hung over a brink his eager thirst to cool and dipped his whiskers in the standing pool when near a courteous frog advanced his head and from the waters hoarseresounding said what art thou stranger what the line you boast what chance has cast thee panting on our coast with strictest truth let all thy words agree nor let me find a faithless mouse in thee if worthy friendship proffered friendship take and entering view the pleasureable lake range over my palace in my bounty share and glad return from hospitable fare this silver realm extends beneath my sway and me their monarch all its frogs obey great physignathus i from peleus race begot in fair hydromedes embrace where by the nuptial bank that paints his side the swift eridanus delights to glide thee too thy form thy strength and port proclaim a sceptered king a son of martial fame then trace thy line and aid my guessing eyes thus ceased the frog and thus the mouse replies known to the gods the men the birds that fly through wild expanses of the midway sky my name resounds and if unknown to thee the soul of great psycarpax lives in me of brave troxartas line whose sleeky down in love compressed lychomile the brown my mother she and princess of the plains wherever her father pternotroctas reigns born where a cabin lifts its airy shed with figs with nuts with varied dainties fed but since our natures naught in common know from what foundation can a friendship grow these curling waters over thy palace roll but mans high food supports my princely soul in vain the circled loaves attempt to lie concealed in flaskets from my curious eye in vain the tripe that boasts the whitest hue in vain the gilded bacon shuns my view in vain the cheeses offspring of the pale or honeyd cakes which gods themselves regale and as in arts i shine in arms i fight mixed with the bravest and unknown to flight though large to mine the humane form appear not man himself can smite my soul with fear sly to the bed with silent steps i go attempt his finger or attack his toe and fix indented wounds with dextrous skill sleeping he feels and only seems to feel yet have we foes which direful dangers cause grim owls with talons armed and cats with claws and that false trap the den of silent fate where death his ambush plants around the bait alldreaded these and dreadful over the rest the potent warriors of the tabby vest if to the dark we fly the dark they trace and rend our heroes of the nibling race but me nor stalks nor watrish herbs delight nor can the crimson radish charm my sight the lakeresounding frogs selected fare which not a mouse of any taste can bear as thus the downy prince his mind expressed his answer thus the croaking king addressed thy words luxuriant on thy dainties rove and stranger we can boast of bounteous jove we sport in water or we dance on land and born amphibious food from both command but trust thy self where wonders ask thy view and safely tempt those seas i will bear thee through ascend my shoulders firmly keep thy seat and reach my marshy court and feast in state he said and bent his back with nimble bound leaps the light mouse and clasps his arms around then wondering floats and sees with glad survey the winding banks resembling ports at sea but when aloft the curling water rides and wets with azure wave his downy sides his thoughts grow conscious of approaching woe his idle tears with vain repentance flow his locks he rends his trembling feet he rears thick beats his heart with unaccustomed fears he sighs and chilled with danger longs for shore his tail extended forms a fruitless oar halfdrenchd in liquid death his prayers he spoke and thus bemoaned him from the dreadful lake so passed europa through the rapid sea trembling and fainting all the venurous way with oary feet the bull triumphant road and safe in crete deposed his lovely load ah safe at last may thus the frog support my trembling limbs to reach his ample court as thus he sorrows death ambiguous grows lo from the deep a water hydra rose he rolls his sanguind eyes his bosom heaves and darts with active rage along the waves confused the monarch sees his hissing foe and dives to shun the sable fates below forgetful frog the friend thy shoulders bore unskilled in swimming floats remote from shore he grasps with fruitless hands to find relief supinely falls and grinds his teeth with grief plunging he sinks and struggling mounts again and sinks and strives but strives with fate in vain the weighty moisture clogs his hairy vest and thus the prince his dying rage expressed nor thou that flings me floundring from thy back as from hard rocks rebounds the shattring wrack nor thou shaltscape thy due perfidious king pursued by vengeance on the swiftest wing at land thy strength could never equal mine at sea to conquer and by craft was thine but heaven has gods and gods have searching eyes ye mice ye mice my great avengers rise this said he sighing gaspd and gasping died his death the young lychopinax espied as on the flowery brink he passed the day baskd in the beams and loyterd life away loud shrieks the mouse his shrieks the shores repeat the nibbling nation learn their heros fate grief dismal grief ensues deep murmurs sound and shriller fury fills the deafend ground from lodge to lodge the sacred heralds run to fix their council with the rising sun where great troxartas crowned in glory reigns and winds his lengthening court beneath the plains psycarpax father father now no more for poor psycarpax lies remote from shore supine he lies the silent waters stand and no kind billow wafts the dead to land homers battle of the frogs etc book ii when rosyfingerd morn had tinged the clouds around their monarchmouse the nation crowds slow rose the sovereign heaved his anxious breast and thus the council filled with rage addressed for lost psycarpax much my soul endures it is mine the private grief the public yours three warlike sons adorned my nuptial bed three sons alas before their father dead our eldest perished by the ravning cat as near my court the prince unheedful sat our next an engine fraught with danger drew the portal gaped the bait was hung in view dire arts assist the trap the fates decoy and men unpitying killed my gallant boy the last his countrys hope his parents pride plunged in the lake by physignathus died rouse all the war my friends avenge the deed and bleed that monarch and his nation bleed his words in every breast inspired alarms and careful mars supplied their host with arms in verdant hulls despoiled of all their beans the buskined warriors stalked along the plains quills aptly bound their bracing corselet made faced with the plunder of a cat they flayed the lamps round boss affords their ample shield large shells of nuts their covering helmet yield and over the region with reflected rays tall groves of needles for their lances blaze dreadful in arms the marching mice appear the wondering frogs perceive the tumult near forsake the waters thickning form a ring and ask and hearken whence the noises spring when near the crowd disclosed to public view the valiant chief embasichytros drew the sacred heralds scepter graced his hand and thus his words expressed his kings command ye frogs the mic with vengeance fired advance and decked in armor shake the shining lance their hapless prince by physignathus slain extends incumbent on the watery plain then arm your host the doubtful battle try lead forth those frogs that have the soul to die the chief retires the crowd the challenge hear and proudlyswelling yet perplexed appear much they resent yet much their monarch blame who rising spoke to clear his tainted fame o friends i never forced the mouse to death nor saw the gaspings of his latest breath he vain of youth our art of swimming tryd and venurous in the lake the wanton died to vengeance now by false appearance led they point their anger at my guiltless head but wage the rising war by deep device and turn its fury on the crafty mice your king directs the way my thoughts elate with hopes of conquest form designs of fate where high the banks their verdant surface heave and the steep sides confine the sleeping wave there near the margin clad in armor bright sustain the first impetuous shocks of fight then where the dancing feather joins the crest let each brave frog his obvious mouse arrest each strongly grasping headlong plunge a foe till countless circles whirl the lake below down sink the mice in yielding waters drowned loud flash the waters and the shores resound the frogs triumphant tread the conquered plain and raise their glorious trophies of the slain he spoke no more his prudent scheme imparts redoubling ardour to the boldest hearts green was the suit his arming heroes chose around their legs the greaves of mallows close green were the beets about their shoulders laid and green the colewort which the target made formed of the varied shells the waters yield their glossy helmets glistned over the field and tapring seareeds for the polished spear with upright order pierced the ambient air thus dressed for war they take the appointed height poize the long arms and urge the promised fight but now where joves irradiate spires arise with stars surrounded in ethereal skies a solemn council called the brazen gates unbar the gods assume their golden seats the sire superior leans and points to show what wondrous combats mortals wage below how strong how large the numerous heroes stride what length of lance they shake with warlike pride what eager fire their rapid march reveals so the fierce centaurs ravaged over the dales and so confirmed the daring titans rose heaped hills on hills and bid the gods be foes this seen the power his sacred visage rears he casts a pitying smile on worldly cares and asks what heavenly guardians take the list or who the mice or who the frogs assist then thus to pallas if my daughters mind have joined the mice why stays she still behind drawn forth by savry steams they wind their way and sure attendance round thine altar pay where while the victims gratify their taste they sport to please the goddess of the feast thus spoke the ruler of the spacious skies but thus resolved the blueeyd maid replies in vain my father all their dangers plead to such thy pallas never grants her aid my flowery wreaths they petulantly spoil and rob my crystal lamps of feeding oil ills following ills but what afflicts me more my veil that idle race profanely tore the web was curious wrought with art divine relentless wretches all the work was mine along the loom the purple warp i spread cast the light shoot and crossed the silver thread in this their teeth a thousand breaches tear the thousand breaches skilful hands repair for which vile earthly dunns thy daughter grieve the gods that use no coin have none to give and learnings goddess never less can owe neglected learning gains no wealth below nor let the frogs to win my succor sue those clamorous fools have lost my favor too for late when all the conflict ceast at night when mystretchd sinews worked with eager fight when spent with glorious toil i left the field and sunk for slumber on my swelling shield lo from the deep repelling sweet repose with noisy croakings half the nation rose devoid of rest with aching brows i lay till cocks proclaimed the crimson dawn of day let all like me from either host forbear nor tempt the flying furies of the spear let heavenly blood or what for blood may flow adorn the conquest of a meaner foe some daring mouse may meet the wondrous odds though gods oppose and brave the wounded gods over gilded clouds reclined the danger view and be the wars of mortals scenes for you so moved the blueeyd queen her words persuade great jove assented and the rest obeyed homers battle of the frogs

the mouse fell thundering and the target rung prone to the ground he sinks his closing eye and soiled in dust his lovely tresses lie a spear at pelion troglodytes cast the missive spear within the bosom past deaths sable shades the fainting frog surround and lifes red tide runs ebbing from the wound embasichytros felt seutlaeus dart transfix and quiver in his panting heart but great artophagus avenged the slain and big seutlaeus tumbling loads the plain and polyphonus dies a frog renowned for boastful speech and turbulence of sound deep through the belly pierced supine he lay and breathed his soul against the face of day the strong lymnocharis who viewed with ire a victor triumph and a friend expire and fiercely flung where troglodytes fought with heaving arms a rocky fragment caught a warrior versed in arts of sure retreat but arts in vain elude impending fate full on his sinewy neck the fragment fell and over his eyelids clouds eternal dwell lychenor second of the glorious name striding advanced and took no wandering aim through all the frog the shining javelin flies and near the vanquished mouse the victor dies the dreadful stroke crambophagus affrights long bred to banquets less inured to fights heedless he runs and stumbles over the steep and wildly floundring flashes up the deep lychenor following with a downward blow reached in the lake his unrecoverd foe gasping he rolls a purple stream of blood distains the surface of the silver flood through the wide wound the rushing entrails throng and slow the breathless carcass floats along lymnisius good tyroglyphus assails prince of the mice that haunt the flowery vales lost to the milky fares and rural seat he came to perish on the bank of fate the dread pternoglyphus demands the fight which tender calaminthius shuns by flight drops the green target springing quits the foe glides through the lake and safely dives below but dire pternophagus divides his way through breaking ranks and leads the dreadful day no nibbling prince excelled in fierceness more his parents fed him on the savage boar but where his lance the field with blood imbrued swift as he moved hydrocharis pursued till fallen in death he lies a shattring stone sounds on the neck and crushes all the bone his blood pollutes the verdure of the pialn and from his nostrils bursts the gushing brain lycopinax with borbocaetes fights a blameless frog whom humbler life delights the fatal javelin unrelenting flies and darkness seals the gentle croakers eyes incensed prassophagus with spritely bound bears cnissiodortes off the rising ground thendragshim over the lake deprived of breath and downward plunging sinks his soul to death but now the great psycarpax shines afar scarce he so great whose loss provoked the war swift to revenge his fatal javelin fled and through the liver struck pelusius dead his freckled corpse before the victor fell his soul indignant fought the shades of hell this saw pelobates and from the flood heaved with both hands a monstrous mass of mud the cloud obscene over all the hero flies dishonours his brown face and blots his eyes enraged and wildly sputtring from the shore a stone immense of size the warrior bore a load for laboring earth whose bulk to raise asks ten degenerate mice of modern days full on the leg arrives the crushing wound the frog supportless wriths upon the ground thus flushed the victor wars with matchless force till loud craugasides arrests his course hoarsecroaking threats precede with fatal speed deep through the belly run the pointed reed then strongly tugd returned imbrued with gore and on the pile his reeking entrails bore the lame sitophagus oppressed with pain creeps from the desperate dangers of the plain and where the ditches rising weeds supply to spread their lowly shades beneath the sky there lurks the silent mouse relieved from heat and safe embowrd avoids the chance of fate but here troxartes physignathus there whirl the dire furies of the pointed spear but where the foot around its ankle plies troxartes wounds and physignathus flies halts to the pool a safe retreat to find and trails a dangling length of leg behind the mouse still urges still the frog retires and half in anguish of the flight expires then pious ardor young prassaeus brings betwixt the fortunes of contending kings lank harmless frog with forces hardly grown he darts the reed in combats not his own which faintly tinkling on troxartes shield hangs at the point and drops upon the field now nobly towering over the rest appears a gallant prince that far transcends his years pride of his sire and glory of his house and more a mars in combat than a mouse his action bold robust his ample frame and meridarpax his resounding name the warrior singled from the fighting crowd boasts the dire honors of his arms aloud then strutting near the lake with looks elate to all its nations threats approaching fate and such his strength the silver lakes around might roll their waters over unpeopled ground but powerful jove who shows no less his grace to frogs that perish than to human race felt soft compassion rising in his soul and shook his sacred head that shook the pole then thus to all the gazing powers began the sire of gods and frogs and mice and man what seas of blood i view what worlds of slain an iliad rising from a days campaign how fierce his javelin over the trembling lakes the blackfurd hero meridarpax shakes unless some favoring deity descend soon will the frogs loquacious empire end let dreadful pallas winged with pity fly and make her aegis blaze before his eye while mars refulgent on his rattling car arrests his raging rival of the war he ceased reclining with attentive head when thus the glorious god of combats said nor pallas jove though pallas take the field with all the terrors of her hissing shield nor mars himself though mars in armor bright ascend his car and wheel amidst the fight not these can drive the desprate mouse afar or change the fortunes of the bleeding war let all go forth all heaven in arms arise or launch thy own red thunder from the skies such ardent bolts as flew that wondrous day when heaps of titans mixed with mountains lay when all the giantrace enormous fell and huge enceladus was hurled to hell twas thus the armipotent advised the gods when from his throne the cloudcompeller nods deep lengthening thunders run from pole to pole olympus trembles as the thunders roll then swift he whirls the brandished bolt around and headlong darts it at the distant ground the bolt discharged inwrapd with lightning flies and rends its flaming passage through the skies then earths inhabitants the niblers shake and frogs the dwellers in the waters quake yet still the mice advance their dread design and the last danger threats the croaking line till jove that inly mourned the loss they bore with strange assistants filled the frighted shore poured from the neighboring strand deformed to view they march a sudden unexpected crew strong suits of armor round their bodies close which like thick anvils blunt the force of blows in wheeling marches turned oblique they go with harpy claws their limbs divide below fell sheers the passage to their mouth command from out the flesh their bones by nature stand broad spread their backs their shining shoulders rise unnumberd joints distort their lengthened thighs with nervous cords their hands are firmly braced their round black eye balls in their bosom placed on eight long feet the wondrous warriors tread and either end alike supplies a head these mortal wits to call the crabs agree the gods have other names for things than we now where the jointures from their loins depend the heroes tails with sevring grasps they rend here short of feet deprived the power to fly there without hands upon the field they lie wrenchd from their holds and scattered all around the bended lances heap the cumberd ground helpless

art here clear the caves there open the leading vein the mines detected flame with gold again how vast how copious are thy new designs how every music varies in thy lines still as i read i feel my bosom beat and rise in raptures by anothers heat thus in the wood when summer dressed the days when windsor lent us tuneful hours of ease our ears the lark the thrush the turtle blessed and philomela sweetest over the rest the shades resound with song  o softly tread while a whole season warbles round my head this to my friend  and when a friend inspires my silent harp its masters hand requires shakes off the dust and makes these rocks resound for fortune placed me in unfertile ground far from the joys that with my soul agree from wit from learning  far oh far from thee here mossgrown trees

neglectful of their pasture stand by turns obsequious to the milkers hand when damon softly trod the shaven lawn damon a youth from city cares withdrawn long was the pleasing walk he wandered through a covered arbor closed the distant view there rests the youth and while the feathered throng raise their wild music thus contrives a song here wafted over by mild etesian air thou country goddess beauteous health repair here let my breast through quivering trees inhale thy rosy blessings with the morning gale what are the fields or flowers or all i see ah tastless all if not enjoyed with thee joy to my soul i feel the goddess nigh the face of nature cheers as well as i over the flat green refreshing breezes run the smiling dazies blow beneath the sun the brooks run purling down with silver waves the planted lanes rejoice with dancing leaves the chirping birds from all the compass rove to tempt the tuneful echoes of the grove high sunny summits deeply shaded dales thick mossy banks and flowery winding vales with various prospect gratify the sight and scatter fixed attention in delight come country goddess come nor thou suffice but bring thy mountainsister exercise called by thy lively voice she turns her pace her winding horn proclaims the finished chase she mounts the rocks she skims the level plain dogs hawks and horses crowd her early train her hardy face repels the tanning wind and lines and meshes loosely float behind all these as means of toil the feeble see but these are helps to pleasure joined with thee let sloth lie softningtill high noon in down or lolling fan her in the sultry town unnervd with rest and turn her own disease or foster others in luxurious ease i mount the courser call the deep mouthed hounds the fox unkennelld flies to covert

snare the fish i fix the luring bait to wound the fowl i load the gun with fate it is thus through change of exercise i range and strength and pleasure rise from every change here beauteous health for

bright presence clouds of sorrow fly for her i mow my walks i platt my bowers clip my low hedges and support my flowers to welcome her this summer seat i dressed and here i court her when she comes to rest when she from exercise to learned ease shall change again and teach the change to please now friends conversing my soft hours refine and tullys tusculum revives in mine now to grave books i bid the mind retreat and such as make me rather good than great or over the works of easy fancy rove where flutes and innocence amuse the grove the native bard that on sicilian plains first sung the lowly manners of the swains or maros muse that in the fairest light paints rural prospects and the charms of sight these soft amusements bring content along and fancy void of sorrow turns to song here beauteous health for all the year remain when the next comes i will charm thee thus again the flies an eclogue when in the river cows for coolness stand and sheep for breezes seek the lofty land a youth whom aesop taught that every tree each bird and insect spoke as well as he walked calmly musing in a shaded way where flowring hawthorn broke the sunny ray and thus instructs his moral pen to draw a scene that obvious in the field he saw near a low ditch where shallow waters meet which never learnt to glide with liquid feet whose naiads never prattle as they play but screend with hedges slumber out the day there stands a slender ferns aspiring shade whose answring branches regularly laid put forth their answring boughs and proudly rise three stories upward in the nether skies for shelter here to shun the noonday heat an airy nation of the flies retreat some in soft air their silken pinions ply and some from bough to bough delighted fly some rise and circling light to perch again a pleasing murmur hums along the plain so when a stage invites to pageant shows if great and small are like appear the beaus in boxes some with spruce pretension sit some change from seat to seat within the pit some roam the scenes or turning cease to roam preluding music fills the lofty dome when thus a fly if what a fly can say deserves attention raised the rural lay where late aminter made a nymph a bride joyful i flew by young favonias side who mindless of the feasting went to sip the balmy pleasure of the shepherds lip i saw the wanton where i stooped to sup and half resolved to drown me in the cup till brushed by careless hands she soared above cease beauty cease to vex a tender love thus ends the youth the buzzing meadow rung and thus the rival of his music sung when suns by thousands shone in orbs of dew i wafted soft with zephyretta flew saw the clean pail and sought the milky cheer while little daphne seized my roving dear wretch that i was i might have warned the dame yet sat indulging as the danger came but the kind huntress left her free to soar ah guard ye lovers guard a mistress more thus from the fern whose highprojecting arms the fleeting nation bent with dusky swarms the swains their love in easy music breathe when tongues and tumult stun the field beneath black ants in teams come darkning all the road some call to march and some to lift the load they strain they labor with incessant pains pressed by the cumbrous weight of single grains the flies struck silent gaze with wonder down the busy burghers reach their earthy town where lay the burdens of a wintry store and thence unwearied part in search more yet one grave sage a moments space attends and the small citys loftiest point ascends wipes the salt dew that trickles down his face and thus harangues them with the gravest grace ye foolish nurslings of the summer air these gentle tunes and whining songs forbear your trees and whispering breeze your grove and love your cupids quiver and his mothers dove let bards to business bend their vigorous wing and sing but seldom if they love to sing else when the flourets of the season fail and this your ferny shade forsakes the vale though one would save ye not one grain of wheat should pay such songsters idling at my gate he ceased the flies incorrigibly vain heard the mayrs speech and fell to sing again an elegy to an old beauty in vain poor nymph to please our youthful sight you sleep in cream and frontlets all the night your face with patches soil with paint repair dress with gay gowns and shade with foreign hair if truth in spite of manners must be told why really fifty five is something old once you were young or one whose lifes so long she might have born my mother tells me wrong and once since envys dead before you dye the women own you played a sparkling eye taught the light foot a modish little trip and pouted with the prettiest purple lip  to some new charmer are the roses fled which blew to damask all thy cheek with red youth calls the graces there to fix their reign and airs by thousands fill their easy train so parting summer bids her flowery prime attend the sun to dress some foreign clime while withering seasons in succession here strip the gay gardens and deform the year but thou since nature bids the world resign it is now thy daughters daughters time to shine with more address or such as pleases more she runs her female exercises over unfurls or closes raps or turns the fan and smiles or blushes at the creature man with quicker life as gilded coaches pass in sideling courtesy the drops the glass with better strength on visitdays she bears to mount her fifty flights of ample stairs her mein her shape her temper eyes and tongue are sure to conquer  for the rogue is young and all that is madly wild or oddly gay we call it only pretty fannys way let time that makes you homely make you sage the sphere of wisdom is the sphere of age it is true when beauty dawns with early fire and hears the flattering tongues of soft desire if not from virtue from its gravest ways the soul with pleasing avocation strays but beauty gone it is easier to be wise as harpers better by the loss of eyes henceforth retire reduce your roving airs haunt less the plays and more the public prayers reject the mechlin head and gold brocade go pray in sober norwich crape arrayed thy pendent diamonds let thy fanny take their trembling luster shows how much you shake or bid her wear thy necklace rowed with pearl you will find your fanny an obedient girl so for the rest with less encumbrance hung you walk through life unmingled with the young and view the shade and substance as you pas with joint endeavor trifling at the glass or folly dressed and rambling all her days to meet her counterpart and grow by praise yet still sedate your self and gravely plain you neither fret nor envy at the vain twas thus if man with woman we compare the wise athenian crossed a glittering fair

nice machine by nature formed to fail my change arrives the change i meet before i thought it nigh my spring my years of pleasure fleet and all their beauties dye in age i search and only find a poor unfruitful gain grave wisdom stalking slow behind oppressed with loads of pain my ignorance could once beguile and fancied joys inspire my errors cherished hope to smile on newlyborn desire but now experience shows the bliss for which i fondly sought not worth the long impatient wish and ardour of the thought my youth met fortune fair arrayed in all her pomp she shone and might perhaps have well essayed to make her gifts my own but when i saw the blessings shower on some unworthy mind i left the chase and owned he power was justly painted blind i passed the glories which adorn the splendid courts of kings and while the persons moved my scorn i rose to scorn the things my manhood felt a vigorous fire by love increased the more but years with coming years conspire to break the chains i wore in weakness safe the sex i see with idle luster shine for what are all their joys to me which cannot now be mine but hold  i feel my gout decrease my troubles laid to rest and truths which would disturb my peace are painful truths at best vainly the time i have to roll in sad reflection flies ye fondling passions of my soul ye sweet deceits arise i wisely change the scene within to things that used to please in pain philosophy is spleen in health it is only ease a nightpiece on death by the blue tapers trembling light no more i waste the wakeful night intent with endless view to pore the schoolmen and the sages over their books from wisdom widely stray or point at best the longest way i will seek a readier path and go where wisdoms surely taught below how deep yon azure dies the sky where orbs of gold unnumberd lie while through their ranks in silver pride the nether crescent seems to glide the slumbering breeze forgets to breathe the lake is smooth and clear beneath where once again the spangled show descends to meet our eyes below the grounds which on the right aspire in dimness from the view retire the left presents a place of graves whose wall the silent water laves that steeple guides thy doubtful sight among the livid gleams of night there pass with melancholy state by all the solemn heaps of fate and think as softlysad you tread above the venerable dead time was like thee they life possessed and time shall be that thou shall rest those graves with bending osier bound that nameless heave the crumbled ground quick to the glancing thought disclose where toil and poverty repose the flat smooth stones that bear a name the chissels slender help to fame which ever our set of friends decay their frequent steps may wear away a middle race of mortals own men half ambitious all unknown the marble tombs that rise on high whose dead in vaulted arches lie whose pillars swell with sculptured stones arms angels epitaphs and bones these all the poor remains of state adorn the rich or praise the great who while on earth in fame they live are senseless of the fame they give ha while i gaze pale cynthia fades the bursting earth unveils the shades all slow and wan and wrapped with shrouds they rise in visionary crowds and all with sober accent cry think mortal what it is to dye now from yon black and funeral yew that bathes the charnel house with dew methinks i hear a voice begin ye ravens cease your croaking din ye tolling clocks no time resound over the long lake and midnight ground it sends a peal of hollow groans thus speaking from among the bones when men my scythe and darts supply how great a king of fears am i they view me like the last of things they make and then they dread my stings fools if you less provoked your fears no more my spectreform appears deaths but a path that must be trod if man would ever pass to god a port of calms a state of ease from the rough rage of swelling seas why then thy flowing sable stoles deep pendent cypress mourning poles loose scarfs to fall athwart thy weeds long palls drawn herses covered steeds and plumes of black that as they tread nod over the scutcheons of the dead nor can the parted body know nor wants the soul these forms of woe as men who long in prison dwell with lamps that glimmer round the cell when cer their suffering years are run spring forth to greet the glittering sun such joy though far transcending sense have pious souls at parting hence on earth and in the body placed a few and evil years they wast but when their chains are cast aside see the glad scene unfolding wide clap the glad wing and tower away and mingle with the blaze of day a hymn to contentment lovely lasting peace of mind sweet delight of human kind heavenly born and bred on high to crown the favorites of the sky with more of happiness below than victors in a triumph know whither o whither art thou fled to lay thy meek contented head what happy region do thou please to make the seat of calms and ease ambition searches all its sphere of pomp and state to meet thee there increasing avarice would find thy presence in its gold enshrined the bold adventrer ploughs his way through rocks amidst the foaming sea to gain thy love and then perceives thou were not in the rocks and waves the silent heart which grief assails treads soft and lonesome over the vales sees daisies open rivers run and seeks as i have vainly done amusing thought but learns to know that solitudes the nurse of woe no real happiness is found in trailing purple over the ground or in a soul exalted high to range the circuit of the sky converse with stars above and know all nature in its forms below the rest it seeks in seeking dies and doubts at last for knowledge rise lovely lasting peace appear this world it self if thou art here is once again with eden blessed and man contains it in his breast twas thus as under shade i stood i sung my wishes to the wood and lost in thought no more perceived the branches whisper as they waved it seemed as all the quiet place confessed the presence of the grace when thus she spoke  go rule thy will bid thy wild passions all be still know god  and bring thy heart to know the joys which from religion flow then every grace shall prove its guest and i will be there to crown the rest oh by yonder mossy seat in my hours of sweet retreat might i thus my soul employ with sense of gratitude and joy raised as ancient prophets were in heavenly vision praise and prayer pleasing all men hurting none pleased and blessed with god alone then while the gardens take my sight with all the colors of delight while silver waters glide along to please my ear and court my song i will lift my voice and tune my string and thee great source of nature sing the sun that walks his airy way to light the world and give the day the moon that shines with borrowed light the stars that gild the gloomy night the seas that roll unnumberd waves the wood that spreads its shady leaves the field whose ears conceal the grain the yellow treasure of the plain all of these and all i see should be sung and sung by me they speak their maker as they can but want and ask the tongue of man go search among your idle dreams your busy or your vain extremes and find a life of equal bliss or own the next begun in this the hermit far in a wild unknown to public view from youth to age a reverend hermit grew the moss his bed the cave his humble cell his food the fruits his drink the crystal well remote from man with god he passed the days prayer all his business all his pleasure praise a life so sacred such serene repose seemed heaven it self till one suggestion rose that vice should triumph virtue vice obey this sprung some doubt of providences sway his hopes no more a certain prospect boast and all the tenor of his soul is lost so when a smooth expanse receives impressed calm natures image on its watery breast down bend the banks the trees depending grow and skies beneath with answring colors glow but if a stone the gentle scene divide swift ruffling circles curl on every side and glimmering fragments of a broken sun banks trees and skies in thick disorder run to clear this doubt to know the world by sight to find if books or swains report it right for yet by swains alone the world he knew whose feet came wandering over the nightly dew he quits his cell the pilgrimstaff he bore and fixed the scallop in his hat before then with the sun a rising journey went sedate to think and watching each event the morn was wasted in the pathless grass and long and lonesome was the wild to pass but when the southern sun had warmed the day a youth came posting over a crossing way his raiment decent his complexion fair and soft in graceful ringlets waved his hair then near approaching father hail he cried and hail my son the reverend sire replied words followed words from question answer flowed and talk of various kind deceived the road till each with other pleased and loath to part while in their age they differ join in heart thus stands an aged elm in ivy bound thus youthful ivy clasps an elm around now sunk the sun the closing hour of day came onward mantled over with sober gray nature in silence bid the world repose when near the road a stately palace rose there by the moon through ranks of trees they pass whose verdure crowned their sloping sides of grass it chanced the noble master of the dome still made his house the wandering strangers home yet still the kindness from a thirst of praise proved the vain flourish of expensive ease the pair arrive the livryd servants wait their lord receives them at the pompous gate the table groans with costly piles of food and all is more than hospitably good then led to rest the days long toil they drown deep sunk in sleep and silk and heaps of down at length it is morn and at the dawn of day along the wide canals the zephyrs play fresh over the gay parterres the breezes creep and shake the neighboring wood to banish sleep up rise the guests obedient to the call an early banquet decked the splendid hall rich luscious wine a golden goblet graced which the kind master forced the guests to taste then pleased and thankful from the porch they go and but the landlord none had cause of woe his cup was vanished for in secret guise the younger guest purloind the glittering prize as one who spys a serpent in his way glistning and basking in the summer ray disordered stops to shun the danger near then walks with faintness on and looks with fear so seemed the sire when far upon the road the shining spoil his wiley partner showed he stopped with silence walked with trembling heart and much he wished but durst not ask to part murmuring he lifts his eyes and thinks it hard that generous actions meet a base reward while thus they pass the sun his glory shrouds the changing skies hang out their sable clouds a sound in air presaged approaching rain and beasts to covert scud a cross the plain warned by the signs the wandering pair retreat to seek for shelter at a neighboring seat twas built with turrets on a rising ground and strong and large and unimprovd around its owners temper timorous and severe unkind and griping caused a desert there as near the misers heavy doors they drew fierce rising gusts with sudden fury blew the nimble lightning mixed with showers began and over their heads loudrolling thunder ran here long they knock but knock or call in vain driven by the wind and battered by the rain at length some pity warmed the masters breast it was then his threshold first received a guest slow creaking turns the door with jealous care and half he welcomes in the shivering pair one frugal faggot lights the naked walls and natures fervor through their limbs recals bread of the coursest sort with eager wine each hardly granted served them both to dine and when the tempest first appeared to cease a ready warning bid them part in peace with still remark the pondring hermit viewed in one so rich a life so poor and rude and why should such within himself he cried lock the lost wealth a thousand want beside but what new marks of wonder soon took place in every settling feature of his face when from his vest the young companion bore that cup the generous landlord owned before and paid profusely with the precious bowl the stinted kindness of this churlish soul but now the clouds in airy tumult fly the sun emerging opes an azure sky a fresher green the smelling leaves display and glittering as they tremble cheer the day the weather courts them from the poor retreat and the glad master bolts the wary gate while hence they walk the pilgrims bosom wrought with all the travel of uncertain thought his partners acts without their cause appear twas there a vice and seemed a madness here detesting that and pitying this he goes lost and confounded with the various shows now nights dim shades again involve the sky again the wandrers want a place to lie again they search and find a lodging nigh the soil improved around the mansion neat and neither poorly low nor idly great it seemed to speak its masters turn of mind content and not for praise but virtue kind hither the walkers turn with weary feet then bless the mansion and the master greet their greeting fair bestowed with modest guise the courteous master hears and thus replies without a vain without a grudging heart to him who gives us all i yield a part from him you come for him accept it here a frank and sober more than costly cheer he spoke and bid the welcome table spread then talked of virtue till the time of bed when the grave household round his hall repair warned by a bell and close the hours with prayer at length the world renewed by calm repose was strong for toil the dappled morn arose before the pilgrims part the younger crept near the closed cradle where an infant slept and writhed his neck the landlords little pride ostrange return grew black and gaspd and died horror of horrors what his only son how looked our hermit when the fact was done not hell though hells black jaws in sunder part and breathe blue fire could more assault his heart confused and struck with silence at the deed he flies but trembling fails to fly with speed his steps the youth pursues the country lay perplexed with roads a servant showed the way a river crossed the path the passage over was nice to find the servant trod before long arms of oaks an open bridge supplied and deep the waves beneath the bending glide the youth who seemed to watch a time to sin approached the careless guide and thrust him in plunging he falls and rising lifts his head then flashing turns and sinks among the dead wild sparkling rage inflames the fathers eyes he bursts the bands of fear and madly cries detested wretch  but scarce his speech began when the strange partner seemed no longer man his youthful face grew more serenely sweet his robe turned white and flowed upon his feet fair rounds of radiant points invest his hair celestial odours breathe through purpled air and wings whose colors glittered on the day wide at his back their gradual plumes display the form etherial bursts upon his sight and moves in all the majesty of light though loud at first the pilgrims passion grew sudden he gazed and wist not what to do surprise in secret chains his words suspends and in a calm his settling temper ends but silence here the beauteous angel broke the voice of music ravished as he spoke thy prayer thy praise thy life to vice unknown in sweet memorial rise before the throne these charms success in our bright region find and force an angel down to calm thy mind for this commissioned i forsook the sky nay cease to kneel  thy fellow servant i then know the truth of government divine and let these scruples be no longer thine the maker justly claims that world he made in this the right of providence is laid its sacred majesty through all depends on using second means to work his ends it is thus withdrawn in state from human eye the power exerts his attributes on high your actions uses not controuls your will and bids the doubting sons of men be still what strange events can strike with more surprise than those which latelystrook thy wondering eyes yet taught by these confess the almighty just and where you cannot unriddle learn to trust the great vain man who fared on costly food whose life was too luxurious to be good who made his ivory stands with goblets shine and forced his guests to morning draughts of wine has with the cup the graceless custom lost and still he welcomes but with less of cost the mean suspicious wretch whose bolted door never moved in duty to the wandering poor with him i left the cup to teach his mind that heaven can bless if mortals will be kind conscious of wanting worth he views the bowl and feels compassion touch his grateful soul thus artists melt the sullen oar of lead with heaping coals of fire upon its head in the kind warmth the metal learns to glow and loose from dross the silver runs below long had our pious friend in virtue trod but now the child halfweand his heart from god child of his age for him he lived in pain and measured back his steps to earth again to what excesses had his dotage run but god to save the father took the son to all but thee in fits he seemed to go and twas my ministry to deal the blow the poor fond parent humbled in the dust now owns in tears the punishment was just but how had all his fortune felt a wrack had that false servant sped in safety back this night his treasured heaps he meant to steal and what a fund of charity would fail thus heaven instructs thy mind this trial over depart in peace resign and sin no more on sounding pinnions here the youth withdrew the sage stood wondering as the seraph flew thus looked elisha when to mount on high his master took the chariot of the sky the fiery pomp ascending left the view the prophet gazed and wished to follow too the bending hermit here a prayer begun lord as in heaven on earth thy will be done then gladly turning sought his ancient place and passed a life of piety and peace finis visions published in the spectators etc by the same hand vision i spectator no   0 decipimur specie recti  hor our defects and follies are too often unknown to us nay they are so far from being known to us that they pass for demonstrations of our worth this makes us easy in the midst of them fond to show them fond to improve in them and to be esteemed for them then it is that a thousand unaccountable conceits gay inventions and extravagant actions must afford us pleasures and display us to others in the colors which we our selves take a fancy to glory in and indeed there is something so amusing for the time in this state of vanity and illgrounded satisfaction that even the wiser world has chosen an exalted word to describe its enchantments and called it the paradise of fools  perhaps the latter part of this reflection may seem a false thought to some and bear another turn than what i have given but it is at present none of my business to look after it who am going to confess that i have been lately amongst them in a vision  methought i was transported to a hill green flowery and of an easy ascent upon the broad top of it resided squinteyed error and popular opinion with many heads two that dealt in sorcery and were famous for bewitching people with the love of themselves to these repaired a multitude from every side by two different paths which lead toward each of them some who had the most assuming air went directly of themselves to error without expecting a conductor others of a softer nature went first to popular opinion from whence as she influenced and engaged them with their own praises she delivered them over to his government  when we had ascended to an open part of the summit where opinion abode we found her entertaining several who had arrived before us her voice was pleasing she breathed odours as she spoke she seemed to have a tongue for every one every one thought he heard of something that was valuable in himself and expected a paradise which she promised as the reward of his merit thus were we drawn to follow her till she should bring us where it was to be bestowed and it was observable that all the way we went the company was either praising themselves in their qualifications or one another for those qualifications which they took to be conspicuous in their own characters or dispraising others for wanting theirs or vying in the degrees of them  at last we approached a bower at the entrance of which error was seated the trees were thickwoven and the place where he sat artfully contrived to darken him a little he was disguised in a whitish robe which he had put on that he might appear to us with a nearer resemblance to truth and as she has a light whereby she manifests the beauties of nature to the eyes of her adorers so he had provided himself with a magical wand that he might do something in imitation of it and please with delusions this he lifted solemnly and muttering to himself bid the glories which he kept under enchantment to appear before us immediately we cast our eyes on that part of the sky to which he pointed and observed a thin blue prospect which cleared as mountains in a summer morning when the mists go off and the palace of vanity appeared to sight  the foundation hardly seemed a foundation but a set of curling clouds which it stood upon by magical contrivance the way by which we ascended was painted like a rainbow and as we went the breeze that played about us bewitched the senses the walls were gilded all for show the lowest set of pillars were of the slight fine corinthian order and the top of the building being rounded bore so far the resemblance of a bubble  at the gate the travelers neither met with a porter nor waited till one should appear every one thought his merits a sufficient passport and pressed forward in the hall we met with several phantoms that roved amongst us and ranged the company according to their sentiments there was decreasing honor that had nothing to show in but an old coat of his ancestors achievements there was ostentation that made himself his own constant subject and gallantry strutting upon his tiptoes at the upper end of the hall stood a throne whose canopy glittered with all the riches that gayety could contrive to lavish on it and between the gilded arms sat vanity decked in the peacocks feathers and acknowledged for another venus by her votaries the boy who stood beside her for a cupid and who made the world to bow before her was called selfconceit his eyes had every now and then a cast in wards to the neglect of all objects about him and the arms which he made use of for conquest were borrowed from those against whom he had a design the arrow which he shot at the soldier was fledged from his own plume of feathers the dart he directed against the man of wit was winged from the quills he writ with and that which he sent against those who presumed upon their riches was headed with gold out of their treasuries he made nets for statesmen from their own contrivances he took fire from the eyes of ladies with which he melted their hearts and lightning from the tongues of the eloquent to inflame them with their own glories at the foot of the throne sat three false graces flattery with a shell of paint affectation with a mirror to practice at and fashion ever changing the posture of her clothes these applied themselves to secure the conquests which selfconceit had gotten and had each of them their particular polities flattery gave new colors and complexions to all things affectation new airs and appearances which as she said were not vulgar and fashion both concealed some home defects and added some foreign external beauties  as i was reflecting upon what i saw i heard a voice in the crowd bemoaning the condition of mankind which is thus managed by the breath of opinion deluded by error fired by selfconceit and given up to be trained in all the courses of vanity till scorn or poverty come upon us these expressions were no sooner handed about but i immediately saw a general disorder till at last there was a parting in one place and a grave old man decent and resolute was led forward to be punished for the words he had uttered he appeared inclined to have spoken in his own defense but i could not observe that any one was willing to hear him vanity cast a scornful smile at him self conceit was angry flattery who knew him for plaindealing put on a vizard and turned away affectation tossed her fan made mouths and called him envy or slander and fashion would have it that at least he must be illmanners thus slighted and despised by all he was driven out for abusing people of merit and figure and i heard it firmly resolved that he should be used no better wherever they met with him hereafter  i had already seen the meaning of most part of that warning which he had given and was considering how the latter words should be fulfilled when a mighty noise was heard without and the door was blackned by a numerous train of harpies crowding in upon us folly and broken credit were seen in the house before they entered trouble shame infamy scorn and poverty brought up the rear vanity with her cupid and graces disappeared her subjects ran into holes and corners but many of them were found and carried off as i was told by one who stood near me either to prisons or cellars solitude or little company the mean arts or the viler crafts of life but these added he with a disdainful air are such who would fondly live here when their merits neither matched the luster of the place nor their riches its expenses we have seen such scenes as these before now the glory you saw will all return when the hurry is over i thanked him for his information and believing him so incorrigible as that he would stay till it was his turn to be taken i made off to the door and overtook some few who though they would not hearken to plaindealing were now terrified to good purpose by the example of others but when they had touched the threshold it was a strange shock to them to find that the delusion of error was gone and they plainly discerned the building to hang a little up in the air without any real foundation at first we saw nothing but a desperate leap remained for us and i a thousand times blamed my unmeaning curiosity that had brought me into so much danger but as they began to sink lower in their own minds methought the palace sunk along with us till they were arrived at the due point of esteem which they ought to have for themselves then the part of the building in which they stood touched the earth and we departing out it retired from our eyes now whether they who stayed in the palace were sensible of this descent i cannot tell it was then my opinion that they were not however it be my dream broke up at it and has given me occasion all my life to reflect upon the fatal consequences of following the suggestions of vanity  vision ii spectator no  0  how are we tortured with the absence of what we covet to possess when it appears to be lost to us what excursions does the soul make in imagination after it and how does it turn into it self again more foolishly fond and dejected at the disappointment our grief instead of having recourse to reason which might restrain it searches to find a further nourishment it calls upon memory to relate the several passages and circumstances of satisfactions which we formerly enjoyed the pleasures we purchased by those riches that are taken from us or the power and splendor of our departed honors or the voice the words the looks the temper and affections of our friends that are deceased it needs must happen from hence that the passion should often swell to such a size as to burst the heart which contains it if time did not make these circumstances less strong and lively so that reason should become a more equal match for the passion or if another desire which becomes more present did not overpower them with a livelier representation these are thoughts which i had when i fell into a kind of vision upon this subject and may therefore stand for a proper introduction to a relation of it  i found my self upon a naked shore with company whose afflicted countenances witnessed their conditions before us flowed a water deep silent and called the river of tears which issuing from two fountains on an upper ground encompassed an island that lay before us the boat which plied in it was old and shattered having been sometimes overset by the impatience and haste of single passengers to arrive at the other side this immediately was brought to us by misfortune who steers it and we were all preparing to take our places when there appeared a woman of a mild and composed behavior who began to deter us from it by representing the dangers which would attend our voyage hereupon some who knew her for patience and some of those too who till then cried the loudest were persuaded by her and returned back the rest of us went in and she whose goodnature would not suffer her to forsake persons in trouble desired leave to accompany us that she might at least administer some small comfort or advice while we sailed we were no sooner embarked but the boat was pushed off the sheet was spread and being filled with sighs which are the winds of that country we made a passage to the farther bank through several difficulties of which the most of us seemed utterly regardless  when we landed we perceived the island to be strangely overcast with fogs which no brightness could pierce so that a kind of gloomy horror sat always brooding over it this had something in it very shocking to easy tempers insomuch that some others whom patience had by this time gained over left us here and privily conveyed themselves round the verge of the island to find a ford by which she told them they might escape  for my part i still went along with those who were for piercing into the center of the place and joining our selves to others whom we found upon the same journey we marched solemnly as at a funeral through bordering hedges of rosemary and through a grove of yewtrees which love to overshadow tombs and flourish in churchyards here we heard on every side the wailings and complaints of several of the inhabitants who had cast themselves disconsolately at the feet of trees and as we chanced to approach any of these we might perceive them wringing their hands beating their breasts tearing their hair or after some other manner visibly agitated with vexation our sorrows were heightened by the influence of what we heard and saw and one of our number was wrought up to such a pitch of wildness as to talk of hanging himself upon a bough which shot temptingly across the path we traveled in but he was restrained from it by the kind endeavors of our abovementioned companion  we had now gotten into the most dusky silent part of the island and by the redoubled sounds of sighs which made a doleful whistling in the branches the thickness of air which occasioned faintish respiration and the violent throbbings of heart which more and more affected us we found that we approached the grotto of grief it was a wide hollow and melancholy cave sunk deep in a dale and watered by rivulets that had a color between red and black these crept slow and half congealed amongst its windings and mixed their heavy murmur with the echo of groans that rolled through all the passages in the most retired part of it sat the doleful being her self the path to her was strewed with goads stings and thorns and the throne on which she sat was broken into a rock with ragged pieces pointing upwards for her to lean upon a heavy mist hung above her her head oppressed with it reclined upon her arm thus did she reign over her disconsolate subjects full of her self to stupidity in eternal pensiveness and the profoundest silence on one side of her stood dejection just dropping into a swoon and paleness wasting to a skeleton on the other side were care inwardly tormented with imaginations and anguish suffering outward troubles to suck the blood from her heart in the shape of vultures the whole vault had a genuine dismalness in it which a few scattered lamps whose blueish flames arose and sunk in their urns discovered to our eyes with increase some of us fell down overcome and spent with what they suffered in the way and were given over to those tormentors that stood on either hand of the presence others galled and mortified with pain recovered the entrance where patience whom we had left behind was still waiting to receive us  with her whose company was now become more grateful to us by the want we had found of her we winded round the grotto and ascended at the back of it out of the mournful dale in whose bottom it lay on this eminence we halted by her advice to pant for breath and lifting our eyes which till then were fixed downwards felt a sullen sort of satisfaction in observing through the shades what numbers had entered the island this satisfaction which appears to have ill nature in it was excusable because it happened at a time when we were too much taken up with our own concern to have respect to that of others and therefore we did not consider them as suffering but our selves as not suffering in the most forlorn estate it had also the groundwork of humanity and compassion in it though the mind was then too deeply engaged to perceive it but as we proceeded onwards it began to discover it self and from observing that others were unhappy we came to question one another when it was that we met and what were the sad occasions that brought us together then we heard our stories we compared them we mutually gave and received pity and so by degrees became tolerable company  a considerable part of the troublesome road was thus deceived at length the openings among the trees grew larger the air seemed thinner it lay with less oppression upon us and we could now and then discern tracts in it of a lighter greyness like the breakings of day short in duration much enlivening and called in that country gleams of amusement within a short while these gleams began to appear more frequent and then brighter and of a longer continuance the sighs that hitherto filled the air with so much dolefulness altered to the sound of common breezes and in general the horrors of the island were abated  when we had arrived at last at the ford by which we were to pass out we met with those fashionable mourners who had been ferried over along with us and who being unwilling to go as far as we had coasted by the shore to find the place where they waited our coming that by showing themselves to the world only at that time when we did they might seem also to have been among the troubles of the grotto here the waters that rolled on the other side so deep and silent were much dried up and it was an easier matter for us to wade over  the river being crossed we were received upon the further bank by our friends and acquaintance whom comfort had brought out to congratulate our appearance in the world again some of these blamed us for staying so long away from them others advised us against all temptations of going back again every one was cautious not to renew our trouble by asking any particulars of the journey and all concluded that in a case of so much affliction we could not have made choice of a fitter companion than patience here patience appearing serene at her praises delivered us over to comfort comfort smiled at his receiving the charge immediately the sky purpled on that side to which he turned and double day at once broke in upon me  vision iii guardian no    quid mentem traxisse polo quid profuit altum erexisse caput pecudum simore pererrant claud i was considering last night when i could not sleep how noble a part of the creation man was designed to be and how distinguished in all his actions above other earthly creatures from whence i fell to take a view of the change and corruption which he has introduced into his own condition the grovelling appetites the mean characters of sense and wild courses of passions that cast him from the degree in which providence had placed him the debasing himself with qualifications not his own and his degenerating into a lower sphere of action this inspired me with a mixture of contempt and anger which however was not so violent as to hinder the return of sleep but grew confused as that came upon me and made me end my reflections with giving mankind the opprobrious names of inconsiderate mad and foolish  here methought where my waking reason left the subject my fancy pursued it in a dream and i imagined my self in a loud soliloquy of passion railing at my species and walking hard to get rid of the company i despised when two men who had overheard me made up on either hand these i observed had many features in common which might occasion the mistake of the one for the other in those to whom they appear single but i who saw them together could easily perceive that though there was an air of severity in each it was tempered with a natural sweetness in the one and by turns constrained or ruffled by the designs of malice in the other  i was at a loss to know the reason of their joining me so briskly when he whose appearance displeased me most thus addressed his companion pray brother let him alone and we shall immediately see him transformed into a tiger this struck me with horror which the other perceived and pitying my disorder bid me be of good courage for though i had been savage in my treatment of mankind whom i should rather reform than rail against he would however endeavor to rescue me from my danger at this i looked a little more cheerful and while i testified my resignation to him we saw the angry brother fling away from us in a passion for his disappointment being now left to my friend i went back with him at his desire that i might know the meaning of those words which so affrighted me  as we went along to inform you says he with whom you have this adventure my name is reproof and his reproach both born of the same mother but of different fathers truth is our common parent friendship who saw her fell in love with her and she being pleased with him he begat me upon her but a while after enmity lying in ambush for her became the father of him whom you saw along with me the temper of our mother enclines us to the same sort of business the informing mankind of their faults but the differing complexions of our fathers make us differ in our designs and company i have a natural benevolence in my mind which engages me with friends and he a natural impetuosity in his which casts him among enemies  as he thus discoursed we came to a place where there were three entrances into as many several walks which lay beside one another we passed into the middlemost a plain strait regular walk set with trees which added to the beauty of the place but did not so close their boughs over head as to exclude the light from it here as we walked i was made to observe how the road on one hand was full of rocks and precipices over which reproach who had already gotten thither was furiously driving unhappy wretches the other side was all laid out in gardens of gaudy tulips amongst whose leaves the serpents wreathed and at the end of every grassy walk the enchantress flattery was weaving bowers to lull souls asleep in we continued still walking on the middle way till we arrived in a building in which it terminated this was formerly erected by truth for a watch tower from whence she took a view of the earth and as she saw occasion sent out reproof or even reproach for our reformation over the door i took notice that a face was carved with a heart upon the lips of it and presently called to mind that this was the ancients emblem of sincerity in the entrance i met with freedom of speech and complaisance who had for a long time looked upon one another as enemies but reproof has so happily brought them together that they now act as friends and fellowagents in the same family before i ascended up the stairs i had my eyes purified by a water which made me see extremely clear and i think they said it sprung in a pit from whence as democritus had reported they formerly brought up truth who had hid her self in it i was then admitted to the upper chamber of prospect which was called the knowledge of mankind here the window was no sooner opened but i perceived the clouds to roll off and part before me and a scene of all the variety of the world presented it self  but how different was mankind in this view from what it used to appear methought the very shape of most of them was lost some had the heads of dogs others of apes or parrots and in short wherever any one took upon him the inferior and unworthy qualities of other creatures the change of his soul became visible in his countenance the strutting pride of him who is endued with brutality instead of courage made his face shoot out in the form of a horses his eyes became prominent his nostrils widened and his wig untying flowed down on one side of his neck in a waving mane the talkativeness of those who love the ill nature of conversation made them turn into assemblies of geese their lips hardened into bills by eternal using they gabbled for diversion they hissed in scandal and their ruffles falling back on their arms a succession of little feathers appeared which formed wings for them to flutter with from one visit to another the envious and malicious lay on the ground with the heads of different sorts of serpents and not endeavoring to erect themselves but meditating mischief to others they sucked the poison of the earth sharpened their tongues to stings upon the stones and rolled their trains unperceivably beneath their habits the hypocritical oppressors wore the faces of crocodiles their mouths were instruments of cruelty their eyes of deceit they committed wickedness and bemoaned that there should be so much of it in the world they devoured the unwary and wept over the remains of them the covetous had so hooked and worn their fingers by counting interest upon interest that they converted to the claws of harpies and these they still were stretching out for more yet seemed unsatisfied with their acquisitions the sharpers had the looks of camelions they every minute changed their appearance and fed on swarms of flies which fell as so many cullies amongst them the bully seemed a dunghill cock he crested well and bore his comb aloft he was beaten by almost every one yet still sung for triumph and only the mean coward pricked up the ears of a hare to fly before him critics were turned into cats whose pleasure and grumbling go together fops were apes in embroidered jackets flatterers were curled spaniels fawning and crouching the crafty had the face of a fox the slothful of an ass the cruel of a wolf the illbred of a bear the leachers were goats and the gluttons swine drunkenness was the only vice that did not change the face of its professors into that of another creature but this i took to be far from a privilege for these two reasons because it sufficiently deforms them of it self and because none of the lower ranks of beings is guilty of so foolish an intemperance  as i was taking a view of these representations of things without any more order than is usual in a dream or in the confusion of the world it self i perceived a concern within me for what i saw my eyes began to moisten and as if the virtue of that water with which they were purified was lost for a time by their being touched with that which arose from a passion the clouds immediately began to gather again and close from either hand upon the prospect i then turned toward my guide who addressed himself to me after this manner you have seen the condition of mankind when it descends from its dignity now therefore guard your self from that degeneracy by a modest greatness of spirit on one side and a conscious shame on the other endeavor also with a generosity of goodness to make your friends aware of it let them know what defects you perceive are growing upon them handle the matter as you see reason either with the airs of severe or humorous affection sometimes plainly describing the degeneracy in its full proper colors or at other times letting them know that if they proceed as they have begun you give them to such a day or so many months to turn bears wolves or foxes etc neither neglect your more remote acquaintance where you see any worthy and susceptible of admonition expose the beasts whose qualities you see them putting on where you have no mind to engage with their persons the possibility of their applying this is very obvious the egyptians saw it so clearly that they made the pictures of animals explain their minds to one another instead of writing and indeed it is hardly to be missed since aesop took them out of their mute condition and taught them to speak for themselves with relation to the actions of mankind  vision iv guardian no    there is a set of mankind who are wholly employed in the illnatured office of gathering up a collection of stories that lessen the reputation of others and spreading them abroad with a certain air of satisfaction perhaps indeed an innocent and unmeaning curiosity a desire of being informed concerning those we live with or a willingness to profit by reflection upon the actions of others may sometimes afford an excuse or sometimes a defense for inquisitiveness but certainly it is beyond all excuse a transgression against humanity to carry the matter further to tear off the dressings as i may say from the wounds of a friend and expose them to the air in cruel fits of diversion and yet we have something more to bemoan an outrage of an higher nature which mankind is guilty of when they are not content to spread the stories of folly frailty and vice but even enlarge them or invent new ones and blacken characters that we may appear ridiculous or hateful to one another from such practices as these it happens that some feel a sorrow and others are agitated with a spirit of revenge that scandals or lies are told because another has told such before that resentments and quarrels arise and injuries are given received and multiplied in a scene of vengeance  all this i have often observed with abundance of concern and having a perfect desire to further the happiness of mankind i lately set my self to consider the causes from whence such evils arise and the remedies which may be applied whereupon i shut my eyes to prevent distraction from outward objects and a while after shot away upon an impulse of thought into the world of ideas where abstracted qualities became visible in such appearances as were agreeable to each of their natures  that part of the country where i happened to light was the most noisy that i had ever known the winds whistled the leaves rustled the brooks rumbled the birds chatterd the tongues of men were heard and the echo mingled something of every sound in its repetition so that there was a strange confusion and uproar of sounds about me at length as the noise still increased i could discern a man habited like a herald and as i afterward understood called novelty that came forward proclaiming a solemn day to be kept at the house of common fame immediately behind him advanced three nymphs who had monstrous appearances the first of these was curiosity habited like a virgin and having an hundred ears upon her head to serve in her enquiries the second of these was talkativeness a little better grown she seemed to be like a young wife and had an hundred tongues to spread her stories the third was censoriousness habited like a widow and surrounded with an hundred squinting eyes of a malignant influence which so obliquely darted on all around that it was impossible to say which of them had brought in the informations she boasted of these as i was informed had been very instrumental in preserving and rearing common fame when upon her birthday she was shuffled into a crowd to escape the search which truth might have made after her and her parents curiosity found her there talkativeness conveyed her away and censoriousness so nursed her up that in a short time she grew to a prodigious size and obtained an empire over the universe wherefore the power in gratitude for these services has since advanced them to her highest employments the next who came forward in this procession was a light damsel called credulity who carried behind them the lamp the silver vessel with a spout and other instruments proper for this solemn occasion she had formerly seen these three together and conjecturing from the number of their ears tongues and eyes that they might be the proper genii of attention familiar converse and ocular demonstration she from that time gave her self up to attend them the last who followed were some who had closely muffled themselves in upper garments so that i could not discern who they were but just as the foremost of them was come up i am glad says she calling me by my name to meet you at this time stay close by me and take a strict observation of all that passes her voice was sweet and commanding i thought i had somewhere heard it and from her as i went along i learned the meaning of every thing which offered  we now marched forward through the rookery of rumors which flew thick and with a terrible din all around us at length we arrived at the house of common fame where a hecatomb of reputations was that day to fall for her pleasure the house stood upon an eminence having a thousand passages to it and a thousand whispering holes for the conveyance of sound the hall we entered was formed with the art of a musickchamber for the improvement of noises rest and silence are banished the place stories of different natures wander in light flocks all about sometimes truths and lies or sometimes lies themselves clashing against one another in the middle stood a table painted after the manner of the remotest asiatick countries upon which the lamp the silver vessel and cups of a white earth were planted in order then dried herbs were brought collected for the solemnity in moonshine and water being put to them there was a greenish liquor made to which they added the flower of milk and an extraction from the canes of america for performing a libation to the infernal powers of mischief after this curiosity retiring to a withdrawingroom brought forth the victims being to appearance a set of small waxen images which she laid upon the table one after another immediately talkativeness gave each of them the name of some one whom for the time they were to represent and censoriousness stuck them all about with black pins still pronouncing at every one she stuck something to the prejudice of the persons represented no sooner were these rites performed and incantations uttered but the sound of a speaking trumpet was heard in the air by which they knew the deity of the place was propitiated and assisting upon this the sky grew darker a storm arose and murmurs sighs groans cries and the words of grief or resentment were heard within it thus the three sorceresses discovered that they whose names they had given to the images were already affected with what was done to them in effigy the knowledge of this was received with loudest the laughter and in many congratulatory words they applauded one anothers wit and power  as matters were at this high point of disorder the muffled lady whom i attended on being no longer able to endure such barbarous proceedings threw off her upper garment of reserve and appeared to be truth as soon as she had confessed her self present the speakingtrumpet ceased to sound the sky cleared up the storm abated the noises which were heard in it ended the laughter of the company was over and a serene light till then unknown to the place was diffused around it at this the detected sorceresses endeavored to escape in a cloud which i saw began to thicken about them but it was soon dispersed their charms being controled and prevailed over by the superior divinity for my part i was exceedingly glad to see it so and began to consider what punishments she would inflict upon them i fancied it would be proper to cut off curiositys ears and fix them to the eaves of houses to nail the tongue of talkativeness to indian tables and to put out the eyes of censoriousness with a flash of her light in respect of credulity i had indeed some little pity and had i been judge she might perhaps have escaped with a hearty reproof  but i soon found that the discerning judge had other designs she knew them for such as will not be destroyed entirely while mankind is in being and yet ought to have a brand and punishment affixed to them that they may be avoided wherefore she took a seat for judgment and had the criminals brought forward by shame ever blushing and trouble with a whip of many lashes two phantoms who had dogged the procession in disguise and waited till they had an authority from truth to lay hands upon them immediately then she ordered curiosity and talkativeness to be fettered together that the one should never suffer the other to rest nor the other ever let her remain undiscovered light credulity she linkt to shame at the tormenters own request who was pleased to be thus secure that her prisoner could not escape and this was done partly for her punishment and partly for her amendment censoriousness was also in like manner begged by trouble and had her assigned for an eternal companion after they were thus chained with one another by the judges order she drove them from the presence to wander for ever through the world with novelty stalking before them  the cause being now over she retreated from sight within the splendour of her own glory which leaving the house it had brightned the sounds that were proper to the place began to be as loud and confused as when we entered and there being no longer a clear distinguished appearance of any objects represented to me i returned from the excursion i had made in fancy  vision v whatever industry and eagerness the modern discoverers have shown for the knowledge of new countries there yet remains an ample field in the creation to which they are utter strangers and which all the methods of traveling hitherto invented will never bring them acquainted with of this i can give a very particular instance in an accident which lately happened to me  as i was on the  th of this instant being febr      walking with my eyes cast upward i fell into a reflection on the vast tracts of air which appeared before me as uninhabited and wherefore said i to my self should all this space be created can it only be for an odd bird to fly through as now and then a man may pass a desert or are there also kingdoms with their particular polities and people of a species which we know nothing of ordained to live in it  it was in this manner i continued my thought when my feet forsook the level and i was insensibly mounted in the air till i arrived at a footing as firm and level as what i had left but with what surprise did i find my self among creatures distinct from us in shape and customs  the inhabitants are of a small stature below those which history describes for pigmies the tallest of them exceed not fourteen or fifteen inches and the least are hardly three this difference proceeds only from their growth before they are brought to light for after we never observe them to grow unless it please their parents who have this uncommon method of enabling them they recall them to the womb where having been for some time they receive an addition to their bulk then go back to their houses and continue at a stand as they did before the experiment has been often tried with success but some have suffered extremely by undergoing it  their skins are like the ancient britains all drawn over with a variety of figures the color made use of for this end is generally black i have indeed observed in some of the religious and lawyers of the country red here and there intermingld though not so commonly of late they tell me too they often used to paint with all colors and i visited two or three of the old inhabitants who were adorned in that fashion but this is now disused since the new inventions by which the use of a black fountain that belongs to that country is rendered more useful and serviceable  the clothes in which they go clad are the skins of beasts worn by some plain by others with figures wrought upon them gold is also made use of by some to beautify their apparel but very seldom silver unless as buckles are by us for fastening the garment before i have seen some of them go like seamen in thin blue shirts others like indians in a partycolored loose kind of apparel and others who they told me were the politicians of the country go about stark naked  the manner of dressing them is this at first when they come into the world they have a suit given them which if it do not fit exactly is not as with us fitted up again but the children are in a cruel manner cut and squeezed to bring them to its proportion yet this they seem not much to regard provided their principal parts are not affected when the dress is thus settled on them they are clad for life it being seldom their custom to alter it or put it off in short they live in it night and day and wear it to rags rather than part with it being sure of the same torture and a greater danger if they should be dressed a second time i have further taken notice that they delight to go open breasted most of them showing their bosoms speckled some lawyers indeed wear them quite white perhaps for distinction sake or to be known at a distance but the finest show is among the beaux and ladies who mightily affect something of gold both before and behind them  food i never saw them eat they being a people who as i observed live in air their houses are all single and high having no back rooms but frequently seven or eight stories which are all separate houses above one another they have one gate to their city and generally no doors to their houses though i have sometimes seen them have particular doors and even made of glass where the inhabitants have been observed to stand many days that their fine apparel may be seen through them if at any time they lie down which they do when they come from their habitations as if coming abroad were their greatest fatigue they will lie together in heaps without receiving hurt though the soundest sleep they get is when they can have dust enough to cover them over  the females amongst them are but few nothing being there produced by a marriage of sexes the males are of a different strength or endowment of parts some having knowledge in an extreme degree and others none at all yet at the same time they are mighty pretenders to instruct others their names for as many as would discover them to me i observed to be the very same as ours are upon earth i met a few who made theirs a mystery but why i am yet to learn they are so communicative that they will tell all the knowledge they boast if a stranger apply himself to their conversation and this may be worth his while if he considers that all languages arts and sciences are professed amongst them i think i may say it without vanity that i knew a certain talisman with proper figures and characters inscribed whereby their greatest people may be charmed brought to reside with a man and serve him like a familiar in the conduct of life  there is no such thing as fighting amongst them but their controversies are determined by words wherein they seldom own themselves conquered yet proceed no further than two or three replies perhaps indeed two others take up their neighbors quarrel but then they desist too after the same manner sometimes however blows have ensued upon their account though not amongst them in such a case they have descended to inspire mankind with their sentiments and chosen champions from among us in order to decide it  the time of their life is very different some dye as soon as born and others in their youth some get a new lease of life by their entering into the womb again and if any weather it out to a hundred years they generally live on to an extreme age after which it is remarkable that instead of growing weaker as we do by time they increase in strength and become at last so confirmed in health that it is the opinion of their country they never can perish while the world remains  the sicknesses which may take them off besides what happens from their natural weakness of body are of different sorts one is overmoisture which affecting their mansions makes them lose their complexions become deformed and rot away insensibly this is often obviated by their not keeping too much within doors another is the worms which prey upon their bowels if they be maimed by accidents they become like us so far useless and that maim will some time or other be the occasion of their ruin however they perish by these means only in appearance and like spirits who vanish in one place to be seen in another but as men dye of passions so disesteem is what the most nearly touches them then they withdraw into holes and corners and consume away in darkness or if they are kept alive a few days by the force of spices it is but a short reprieve from their perishing to eternity without any honor but that instead of a burial a small pyre of past should be erected over them while they like the ancient romans are reduced to ashes  n b this vision is to be understood of a library of books  finis errata in pervigilio veneris page    verse   pro spameo lege spumeo p  0
