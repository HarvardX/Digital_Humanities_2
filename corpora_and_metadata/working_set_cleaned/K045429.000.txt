great but very irregular family is place was on the whole agreeable to him and ited to his gay thoughtless temper he found a entiful table and a good cellar there was ined a good deal of work to be done though it as performed with much disorder and confusion e family in the main were not unkind to him ough they often contradicted and crossed him pecially when things went ill with themselves is william never much liked for he was alys fond of having his own way there was a erry or rather a noisy and riotous servants hall  disorder and quarrels are indeed the usual ects of plenty and unrestrained indulgence the en were smart but idle the maids were showy but entious and all did pretty much as they liked  a time but the time was commonly short the ages were reckoned high but they were seldom id and it was even said by sober people that the aster was insolvent and never fulfilled any of his attering engagements or his most positive proises but still notwithstanding his real poverty things went on with just the same thoughtlesnes and splendour and neither masters or servants looked beyond the jollity of the present hour  in this unruly family there was little church going and still less praying at home they pretende indeed in a general way to believe in the bible bu it was only an outward profession few of them rea it at all and even of those who did read it still fewe were governed by it there was indeed a bibl lying on the table in the great hall which wa kept for the purpose of administering an oath b was seldom used on any other occasion and some of the heads of the family were of opinion that th was its only real use as it might serve to keep the lower parts of it in order  william who was fond of novelty and pleasur was apt to be negligent of the duties of the house he used to stay out on his errands and one of  favorite amusements was going to the parade to s the soldiers exercise he saw with envy ho smartly they were dressed listened with rapture  the music and fancied that a soldier had nothi to do but to walk to and fro in a certain regul order to go through a little easy exercise in sho to live without fighting fatigue or danger  o said he whenever he was affronted  home what a fine thing it must be to be a sdier to be so well dressed to have nothing to  but to move to the pleasant sound of sife and dru and to have so many people come to look at o and admire one o it must be a fine thing to b soldier  yet when the vexation of the moment was ov he found so much ease and diversion in his mast house so suited to his low taste and sensual aptites that he thought no more of the matter he forgot the glories of a soldier and eagerly returned to all the mean gratifications of the kitchen his evil habits were but little attended to by those with whom he lived his faults among which were lying and swearing were not often corrected by the family who had little objection to those sins which only ofended god and did not much affect their own interest r property and except that william was obliged to work rather more than he liked he found little while e was young and healthy that was very disagreeale in this service so he went on still thinking howver when things went a little cross what a ne thing it was to be a soldier and at last one ay as he was waiting at dinner he had the misforune to let fall a china dish and broke it all to ieces it was a curious dish much valued by the amily as they pretended this family were indeed pt to set a false fantastic value on things and not  estimate them by their real worth the heads f the family who had generally been rather paent and goodhumoured with william as i said before for these vices which though offensive to od did not touch their own pocket now flew out to a violent passion with him called him a thound hard names and even threatened to horsehip him for his shameful negligence  william in a great fright for he was a sad cowd at bottom ran directly out of the house to avoid e threatened punishment and happening just at at very time to pass by the parade where the oldiers chanced to be then exercising his resoluon was taken in a moment he instantly deterined to be no more a slave as he called it he ould return no more to be subject to the humors of a tyrannical family no he was resolved to b free or at least if he must serve he would serve n master but the king  william who had now and then happened to hea from the accidental talk of the soldiers that tho who served the great family he had lived with we slaves to their tyranny and vices had also hea in the same casual manner that the service of the king was perfect freedom now he had taken it in his head to hope that this might be a freedom  do evil or at least to do nothing so he thought  was the only place in the world to suit him  a fine likely young fellow as william was ha no great difficulty to get enlisted the few for were soon settled he received the bountymone as eagerly as it was offered took the oaths of allgiance and was joined to the regiment and hearti welcomed by his new comrades he was the hapiest fellow alive all was smooth and calm t day happened to be very fine and therefore william always reckoned upon a fine day the scene w gay and lively the music cheerful he found t exercise very easy and he thought there was litt more expected from him  he soon began to flourish away in his talk an when he met with any one of his old fellow servan he fell a prating about marches and countermarche and blockades and battles and sieges and bloo and death and triumphs and victories all at radom for these were words and phrases he h picked up without at all understanding what  said he had no knowledge and therefore he h no modesty he had no experience and therefo he had no fears  all seemed to go on swimmingly for he had yet no trial he began to think with triumph what  mean life he had escaped from in the old quarrelsome family and what a happy honorable life he should have in the army o there was no life like he life of a soldier  in a short time however war broke out his regiment was one of the first which was called out o actual and hard service as william was the ost raw of all the recruits he was the first to murur at the difficulties and hardships the cold and unger the fatigue and danger of being a soldier what watchings and perils and trials and hardhips and difficulties he now thought attended a military life surely said he i could never ave suspected all this misery when i used to see he men on the parade in our town  he now found when it was too late that all the elddays he used to attend all the evolutions and xercises which he had observed the soldiers to go through in the calm times of peace and safety were nly meant to fit train and qualify them for the ctual service which they were now sent out to perorm by the command of the king  the truth is william often complained when ere was no real hardship to complain of for e common troubles of life fell out pretty much ike to the great family which william had left and  the soldiers in the kings army but the spirit f obedience discipline and selfdenial of the latter emed hardships to one of williams loose turn of ind when he began to murmur some good old ldier clapped him on the back saying cheer p lad it is a kingdom you are to strive for if we int not henceforth there is laid up for us a great eward we have the kings word for it man william observed that to those who truly believed thi their labors were as nothing but he himself did not at the bottom believe it and it was observe of all the soldiers who failed the true cause wa that they did not really believe the kings promis he was surprised to see the then soldiers who use to bluster and boast and deride the assaults of the enemy now began to fall away while such as ha faithfully obeyed the kings orders and believe in his word were sustained in the hour of tria those who had trusted in their own strength all fained in the slightest attack while those who had p on the armor of the kings providing the sword and the shield and the helmet and the breastplat and whose feet were shod according to order no endured hardships as good soldiers and were eabled to fight the good fight  an engagement was expected immediately the men were ordered to prepare for battle whi the rest of the corpse were so preparing william whole thoughts were bent on contriving how h might desert but alas he was watched on a sides he could not possibly devise any means  escape the danger increased every moment the battle came on william who had been so sure an confident before he entered flinched in the mment of trial while his more quiet and less boasful comrades prepared boldly to do their dut william looked about on all sides and saw th there was no eye upon him for he did not kno that the kings eye was every where at once  at last thought he spied a chance of escaping n from the enemy but from his own army whi he was endeavoring to escape a ball from the oposite camp took off his leg as he fell the fir ords which broke from him were while i was  my duty i was preseed in the very act of derting i am wounded he lay expecting every oment to be trampled to death but as soon as the onfusion was a little over he was taken off the eld by some of his own party laid in a place of fety and left to himself after his wound was ressed  the skirmish for it proved nothing more was on over the greater part of the regiment esped in safety while the few who fell rejoiced at they fell in their duty william in the mean e suffered cruelly both in mind and body to e pains of a wounded soldier he added the disace of a coward and the infamy of a deserter o cried he why was i such a fool as to leave e great family i lived in where there was meat d drink enough and to spare only on account of little quarrel i might have made up that with em as we had done our former quarrels why d i leave a life of ease and pleasure where i had ly a little rub now and then for a life of daily scipline and constant danger why did i turn dier o what a miserable animal is a soldier  as he was sitting in this weak and disabled conion uttering the above complaints he observed  enerable old officer with thin gray locks on his ad and on his face deep wrinkles engraved by e and many an honest scar inflicted by war illiam had heard this old officer highly comnded for his extraordinary courage and conduct  battle and in peace he used to see him cool d collected devoutly employed in reading and ying in the interval of more active duties he ld not help comparing this officer with himself i said he flinched and drew back and wou even have deserted in the moment of peril an now in return i have no consolation in the ho of repose and safety i would not fight then i ca not pray now o why would i ever think of bei a soldier he then began afresh to weep and lment and he groaned so loud that he drew the notice of the officer who came up to him kind sat down by him took him by the hand and iquired with as much affection as if he had been h brother what was the matter with him and wh particular distress more than the common fortu of war it was which drew from him such bitt groans i know something of surgery add he let me examine your wound and assist yo with such little comforts as i can  william at once saw the difference betwe the soldiers in the kings army and the peop in the great family the latter commonly withdr their kindness in sickness and trouble when m wanted which was just the very time when  others came forward to assist he told the offi his little history the manner of his living in  great family the trifling cause of his quarrelli with it the slight ground of his entering i the kings service sir said he i quarrled with the family and i thought i was at o fit for the army i did not know the qualificati it required i had not reckoned on discipli and hardships and selfdenial i liked well enou to sing a loyal song or drink the kings heal but i find i do not relish working and fighting  him though i rashly promised even to lay do my life for his service if called upon when i to the bounty money and the oath of allegian n short sir i find that i long for the ease and oth the merriment and the feasting of my old ervice i find i cannot be a soldier and to speak truth i was in the very act of deserting when  was stopped short by the cannon ball so that i el the guilt of deserting and the misery of havg lost my leg into the bargain  the officer thus replied your state is that of  very worldly irreligious man the great family ou served is a just picture of the world the ages the world promises to those who are willing to o its work are high but the payment is attended ith much disappointment nay the world like our great family is in itself insolvent and in its ery nature incapable of making good the proises and of paying the high rewards which it olds out to tempt its credulous followers the ngodly world like your family cares little for urch and still less for prayers and considers e bible rather as an instrument to make an oath nding in order to keep the vulgar in obedice than as containing in itself a perfect rule of ith and practice and as a titledeed to heaven he generality of men love the world as you did our service while it smiles upon them and gives em easy work and plenty of meat and drink but  soon as it begins to cross and contradict them ey get out of humor with it just as you did ith your service they then think its drudgery rd its rewards low they find out that it is gh in its expectations from them and slack in  payments to them and they begin to fancy because they do not hear religious people murur as they do that there must be some happiness  religion the world which takes no account of their deeper sins at length brings them into discrdit for some act of imprudence just as your fami overlooked your lying and swearing but threaened to drub you for breaking a china dish su is the judgment of the world it particular bears with those who only break the laws  god but severely punishes the smallest neggence by which property is injured the wor sooner pardons the breaking ten commandmen of god than even a china dish of its own  after some cross or opposition worldly men  i said before begin to think how much content a cheerfulness they remember to have seen in religio people they therefore begin to fancy that region must be an easy and delightful as well as  good thing they have heard that her wa are ways of pleasantness and all her paths a peace and they persuade themselves that  this is meant worldly pleasantness and sensu peace they resolve at length to try it to tu their back upon the world to engage in t service of god and turn christians just as y resolved to leave your old service to enter i the service of the king and turn soldier but  you quitted your place in a passion so they lea the world in a huff they do not count the  they do not calculate upon the darling sins the bitual pleasures the ease and vanities which  undertake by their new engagements to renoun any more than you counted what indulgences  were going to give up when you quitted the luries and idleness of your place to enlist in the diers warfare they have as i said seen chtians cheerful and they mistook the ground  their cheerfulness they fancied it arose not  cause through grace they had conquered diffices but because they had no difficulties in their assage they fancied that religion found the road ooth whereas it only helps to bear with a rough ad without complaint they do not know that ese christians are of good cheer not because the orld is free from tribulation but because christ eir captain has overcome the world but the  religious man who has only seen the outside of a hristian in his worldly intercourse knows little of  secret conflicts his trials his selfdenials his arfare with the world without and with his own rrupt desires within  the irreligious man quarrels with the world on me such occasion as you did with your place  now puts on the outward forms and ceremoes of religion and assumes the badges of chrisnity just as you were struck with the shows of  field day just as you were pleased with the usic and the marching and put on the cockade and e red coat all seems smooth for a little while e goes through the outward exercises of a chrisn a degree of credit attends his new profeson but he never suspects there is either diffilty or discipline attending it he fancies reliion is a thing for talking about and not a thing  the heart and the life he never suspects that  the psalmsinging he joins in and the sermons he ars and the other means he is using are only  the exercises and the evolutions of the soldiers  fit and prepare him for actual service and that ese means are no more religion itself than the ercises and evolutions of your parade were real arsare  at length some trial arises this nominal chrisan is called to differ from the world in some great point something happens which may stri at his comfort or his credit or security t cools his zeal for religion just as the view of  engagement cooled your courage as a soldie he finds he was only angry with the world  was not tired of it he was out of humor wi the world not because he had seen through  vanity and emptiness but because the world w out of humor with him he finds that it is  easy thing to be a fairweather christian b where there is nothing to be done and confide where there is nothing to be feared difficult unmask him to others temptations unmask h to himself he discovers that though he is a hi professor he is no christian just as you fou out that your red coat and your cockade yo shoulderknot and your musket did not preve you from being a coward  your misery in the military life like that of  nominal christian arose from your love of ea your cowardice and your selfignorance y rushed into a new way of life without trying af one qualification for it a total change of he and temper were necessary for your new calli with new views and new principles the soldie life would have been not only easy but delight to you but while with a new profession you tained your old nature it is no wonder all cipline seemed intolerable to you  the true christian like the brave soldier  supported under dangers by a strong faith  the fruits of that victory for which he fights  be safety and peace but alas the pleasures  this world are present and visible the kingd and the crown for which he strives are remo he is therefore apt to think them uncertain he s therefore apt to fail because nothing short of a ively faith can outweigh the present temptation and teach him to prefer the joys of conquest to he pleasures of sloth  whether william went back to his old serice or was received again into the army may be nown hereafter  z  finis   a
