went to church in the neighboring town where we dined at euphranors and after evening service returned to the two philosophers whom we found in the library they told us that if there was a god he was present every where as well as at church and that if we had been serving him one way they did not neglect to do as much another inasmuch as a free exercise of reason must be allowed the most acceptable service and worship that a rational creature can offer to its creator however said alciphron if you gentlemen can but solve the difficulties which i shall propose tomorrow morning i promise to go to church next sunday after some general conversation of this kind we sat down to a light supper and the next morning assembled at the same place as the day before where being all seated i observed that the foregoing week our conferences had been carried on for a longer time and with less interruption than i had ever known or well could be in town where mens hours are so broken by visits business and amusements that whoever is content to form his notions from conversation only must needs have them very shattered and imperfect and what have we got replied alciphron by all these continued conferences for my part i think my self just where i was with respect to the main point that divides us the truth of the christian religion i answered that so many points had been examined discussed and agreed between him and his adversaries that i hoped to see them come to an entire agreement in the end for in the first place said i the principles and opinions of those who are called freethinkers or minute philosophers have been pretty clearly explained it has been also agreed that vice is not of that benefit to the nation which some men imagine that virtue is highly useful to mankind but that the beauty of virtue is not alone sufficient to engage them in the practice of it that therefore the belief of a god and providence ought to be encouraged in the state and tolerated in good company as a useful notion further it has been proved that there is a god that it is reasonable to worship him and that the worship faith and principles prescribed by the christian religion have a useful tendency admit replied alciphron addressing himself to crito all that dion says to be true yet this does not hinder my being just where i was with respect to the main point since there is nothing in all this that proves the truth of the christian religion though each of those particulars enumerated may perhaps prejudice in its favor i am therefore to suspect my self at present for a prejudiced person prejudiced i say in favor of christianity this as i am a lover of truth puts me upon my guard against deception i must therefore look sharp and well consider every step i take  ii cri you may remember alciphron you proposed for the subject of our present conference the consideration of certain difficulties and objections which you had to offer against the christian religion we are now ready to hear and consider whatever you shall think fit to produce of that kind atheism and a wrong notion of christianity as of something hurtful to mankind are great prejudices the removal of which may dispose a man to argue with candor and submit to reasonable proof but the removing prejudices against an opinion is not to be reckoned prejudicing in its favor it may be hoped therefore that you will be able to do justice to your cause without being fond of it alc o crito that man may thank his stars to whom nature has given a sublime soul who can raise himself above popular opinions and looking down on the herd of mankind behold them scattered over the surface of the whole earth divided and subdivided into numberless nations and tribes differing in notions and tenets as in language manners and dress the man who takes a general view of the world and its inhabitants from this lofty stand above the reach of prejudice seems to breathe a purer air and to see by a clearer light but how to impart this clear and extensive view to those who are wandering beneath in the narrow dark paths of error this indeed is a hard task but hard as it is i shall try if by any means  clara tuae possim praepandere lumina menti lucret know then that all the various casts or sects of the sons of men have each their faith and their religious system germinating and sprouting forth from that common grain of enthusiasm which is an original ingredient in the composition of humane nature they shall each tell of intercourse with the invisible world revelations from heaven divine oracles and the like all which pretensions when i regard with an impartial eye it is impossible i should assent to all and i find within my self something that withholds me from assenting to any of them for although i may be willing to follow so far as common sense and the light of nature lead yet the same reason that bids me yield to rational proof forbids me to admit opinions without proof this holds in general against all revelations whatsoever and be this my first objection against the christian in particular cri as this objection supposes there is no proof or reason for believing the christian if good reason can be assigned for such belief it comes to nothing now i presume you will grant the authority of the reporter is a true and proper reason for believing reports and the better this authority the juster claim it has to our assent but the authority of god is on all accounts the best whatever therefore comes from god it is most reasonable to believe  iii alc this i grant but then it must be proved to come from god cri and are not miracles and the accomplishments of prophecies joined with the excellency of its doctrine a sufficient proof that the christian religion came from god alc miracles indeed would prove something but what proof have we of these miracles cri proof of the same kind that we have or can have of any facts done a great way off and a long time ago we have authentic accounts transmitted down to us from eyewitnesses whom we cannot conceive tempted to impose upon us by any humane motive whatsoever inasmuch as they acted therein contrary to their interests their prejudices and the very principles in which they had been nursed and educated these accounts were confirmed by the unparalled subversion of the city of jerusalem and the dispersion of the jewish nation which is a standing testimony to the truth of the gospel particularly of the predictions of our blessed savior these accounts within less than a century were spread throughout the world and believed by great numbers of people these same accounts were committed to writing translated into several languages and handed down with the same respect and consent of christians in the most distant churches do you not see said alciphron staring full at crito that all this hangs by tradition and tradition take my word for it gives but a weak hold it is a chain whereof the first links may be stronger than steel and yet the last weak as wax and brittle as glass imagine a picture copied successively by an hundred painters one from another how like must the last copy be to the original how lively and distinct will an image be after an hundred reflections between two parallel mirrours thus like and thus lively do i think a faint vanishing tradition at the end of sixteen or seventeen hundred years some men have a false heart others a wrong head and where both are true the memory may be treacherous hence there is still something added something omitted and something varied from the truth and the sum of many such additions deductions and alterations accumulated for several ages do at the foot of the account make quite another thing cri ancient facts we may know by tradition oral or written and this latter we may divide into two kinds private and public as writings are kept in the hands of particular men or recorded in public archives now all these three sorts of tradition for ought i can see concur to attest the genuine antiquity of the gospels and they are strengthened by collateral evidence from rites instituted festivals observed and monuments erected by ancient christians such as churches baptisteries and sepulchers now allowing your objection holds against oral tradition singly taken yet i can think it no such difficult thing to transcribe faithfully and things once committed to writing are secure from slips of memory and may with common care be preserved entire so long as the manuscript lasts and this experience shows may be above a thousand years the alexandrine manuscript is allowed to be above twelve hundred years old and it is highly probable there were then extant copies four hundred years old a tradition therefore of above sixteen hundred years need have only two or three links in its chain and these links notwithstanding that great length of time may be very sound and entire since no reasonable man will deny that an ancient manuscript may be of much the same credit now as when it was first written we have it on good authority and it seems probable that the primitive christians were careful to transcribe copies of the gospels and epistles for their private use and that other copies were preserved as public records in the several churches throughout the world and that portions thereof were constantly read in their assemblies can more be said to prove the writings of classic authors or ancient records of any kind authentic alciphron addressing his discourse to euphranor said it is one thing to silence an adversary and another to convince him what do you think euphranor euph doubtless it is alc but what i want is to be convinced euph that point is not so clear alc but if a man had ever so much mind he cannot be convinced by probable arguments against demonstration euph i grant he cannot  iv alc now it is as evident as demonstration can make it that no divine faith can possibly be built upon tradition suppose an honest credulous countryman catechized and lectured every sunday by his parish priest it is plain he believes in the parson and not in god he knows nothing of revelations and doctrines and miracles but what the priest tells him this he believes and this faith is purely humane if you say he has the liturgy and the bible for the foundation of his faith the difficulty still recurs for as to the liturgy he pins his faith upon the civil magistrate as well as the ecclesiastic neither of which can pretend divine inspiration then for the bible he takes both that and his prayer book on trust from the printer who he believes made true editions from true copies you see then faith but what faith faith in the priest in the magistrate in the printer editor transcriber none of which can with any pretense be called divine i had the hint from cratylus it is a shaft out of his quiver and believe me a keen one euph let me take and make trial of this same shaft in my hands suppose then your countryman hears a magistrate declare the law from the bench or suppose he reads it in a statute book what think you is the printer or the justice the true and proper object of his faith and submission or do you acknowledge a higher authority whereon to found those loyal acts and in which they do really terminate again suppose you read a passage in tacitus that you believe true would you say you assented to it on the authority of the printer or transcriber rather than the historian alc perhaps i would and perhaps i would not i do not think my self obliged to answer these points what is this but transferring the question from one subject to another that which we considered was neither law nor profane history but religious tradition and divine faith i see plainly what you aim at but shall never take fro an answer to one difficulty the starting of another cri o alciphron there is no taking hold of you who expect that others should as you were pleased to express it hold fair and stand firm while you plucked out their prejudices how shall he argue with you but from your concessions and how can he know what you grant except you will be pleased to tell him euph but to save you the trouble for once i will suppose an answer my question admits but of two answers take your choice from the one it will follow that by a parity of reason we can easily conceive how a man may have divine faith though he never felt inspiration or saw a miracle inasmuch as it is equally possible for the mind through whatever conduit oral or scriptural divine revelation be derived to carry its thought and submission up to the source and terminate its faith not in humane but divine authority not in the instrument or vessel of conveyance but in the great origin it self as its proper and true object from the other answer itwill follow that you introduce a general skepticism into humane knowledge and break down the hinges on which civil government and all the affairs of the world turn and depend in a word that you would destroy humane faith to get rid of divine and how this agrees with your professing that you want to be convinced i leave you to consider  v alc i should in earnest be glad to be convinced one way or other and come to some concluclusion but i have so many objections in store you are not to count much upon getting over one depend on it you shall find me behave like a gentleman and lover of truth i will propose my objections briefly and plainly and accept of reasonable answers as fast as you can give them come euphranor make the most of your tradition you can never make that a constant and universal one which is acknowledged to have been unknown or at best disputed in the church for several ages and this is the case of the canon of the new testament for though we have now a canon as they call it settled yet every one must see and own that tradition cannot grow stronger by age and that what was uncertain in the primitive times cannot be undoubted in the subsequent what say you to this euphranor euph i should be glad to conceive your meaning clearly before i return an answer it seems to me this objection of yours supposes that where a tradition has been constant and undisputed such tradition may be admitted as a proof but that where the tradition is defective the proof must be so too is this your meaning alc it is euph consequently the gospels and epistles of st paul which were universally received in the beginning and never since doubted of by the church must notwithstanding this objection be in reason admitted for genuine and if these books contain as they really do all those points that come into controversy between you and me what need i dispute with you about the authority of some other books of the new testament which came later to be generally known and received in the church if a man assents to the undisputed books he is no longer an infidel though he should not hold the revelations or the epistle of s james or jude or the latter of s peter or the two last of s john to be canonical the additional authority of these portions of holy scripture may have its weight in particular controversies between christians but can add nothing to arguments against an infidel as such wherefore though i believe good reasons may be assigned for receiving these books yet these reasons seem now beside our purpose when you are a christian it will be then time enough to argue this point and you will be the nearer being so if the way be shortened by omitting it for the present alc not so near neither as you perhaps imagine for notwithstanding all the fair and plausible things you may say about tradition when i consider the spirit of forgery which reigned in the primitive times and reflect on the several gospels acts and epistles attributed to the apostles which yet are acknowledged to be spurious i confess i cannot help suspecting the whole euph tell me alciphron do you suspect all platos writings for spurious because the dialogue upon death for instance is allowed to be so or will you admit none of tullys writings to be genuine because sigonius imposed a book of his own writing for tullys treatise de consolatione and the imposture passed for some time on the world alc suppose i admit for the works of tully and plato those that commonly pass for such what then euph why then i would fain know whether it be equal and impartial in a freethinker to measure the credibility of profane and sacred books by a different rule let us know upon what foot we christians are to argue with minute philosophers whether we may be allowed the benefit of common maxims in logic and criticism if we may be pleased to assign a reason why supposititious writings which in the style and manner and matter bear visible marks of imposture and have accordingly been rejected by the church can be made an argument against those which have been universally received and handed down by an unanimous constant tradition there have been in all ages and in all great societies of men many capricious vain or wicked impostors who for different ends have abused the world by spurious writings and created work for critics both in profane and sacred learning and it would seem as silly to reject the true writings of profane authors for the sake of the spurious as it would seem unreasonable to suppose that among the heretics and several sects of christians there should be none capable of the like imposture  vi alc but be the tradition ever so well attested and the books ever so genuine yet i cannot suppose them wrote by persons divinely inspired so long as i see in them certain characters inconsistent with such a supposition surely the purest language the most perfect style the exactest method and in a word all the excellencies of good writing might be expected in a piece composed or dictated by the spirit of god but books wherein we find the reverse of all this it were impious not to reject but to attribute to the divinity euph say alciphron are the lakes the rivers or the ocean bounded by straight lines are the hills and mountains exact cones or pyramids or the stars cast into regular figures alc they are not euph but in the works of insects we may observe figures as exact as if they were drawn by the rule and compass alc we may euph should it not seem therefore that a regular exactness or scrupulous attention to what men call the rules of art is not observed in the great productions of the author of nature alc it should euph and when a great prince declares his will in laws and edicts to his subjects is he careful about a pure style or elegant composition does he not leave his secretaries and clerks to express his sense in their own words is not the phrase on such occasions thought proper if it conveys as much as was intended and would not the divine strain of certain modern critics be judged affected and improper for such uses alc it must be owned laws and edicts and grants for soloecism and tautology are very offensive to the harmonious ears of a fine writer euph why then should we expect in the oracles of god an exactness that would be misbecoming and beneath the dignity of an earthly monarch and which bears no proportion or resemblance to the magnificent works of the creation alc but granting that a nice regard to particles and critical rules is a thing too little and mean to be expected in divine revelations and that there is more force and spirit and true greatness in a negligent unequal style than in the wellturned periods of a polite writer yet what is all this to the bald and flat compositions of those you call the divine penmen i can never be persuaded the supreme being would pick out the poorest and meanest of scriblers for his secretaries euph o alciphron if i durst follow my own judgment i should be apt to think there are noble beauties in the style of the holy scripture in the narrative parts a strain so simple and unaffected in the devotional and prophetic so animated and sublime and in the doctrinal parts such an air of dignity and authority as seems to speak their original divine but i shall not enter into a dispute about taste much less set up my judgment on so nice a point against that of the wits and men of genius with which your sect abounds and i have no temptation to it inasmuch as it seems to me the oracles of god are not the less so for being delivered in a plain dress rather than in the enticing words of mans wisdom alc this may perhaps be an apology for some simplicity and negligence in writing  vii but what apology can be made for nonsense crude nonsense of which i could easily assign many instances having once in my life read the scripture through with that very view look here said he opening a bible in the forty ninth psalm the author begins very magnificently calling upon all the inhabitants of the earth to give ear and assuring them his mouth shall speak of wisdom and the meditation of his heart shall be of understanding  quid dignum tanto seret hic promissor hiatu he has no sooner done with his preface but he puts this senleless question wherefore should i fear in the days of evil when the wickedness of my heels shall compass me about the iniquity of my heels what nonsense after such a solemn introduction euph for my own part i have naturally weak eyes and know there are many things that i cannot see which are nevertheless distinctly seen by others i do not therefore conclude a thing to be absolutely invisible because it is so to me and since it is possible it may be with my understanding as it is with my eyes i dare not pronounce a thing to be nonsense because i do not understand it of this passage many interpretations are given the word rendered heels may signify fraud or supplantation by some it is translated past wickedness the heel being the hinder part of the foot by others iniquity in the end of my days the heel being one extremity of the body by some the iniquity of my enemies that may supplant me by others my own faults or iniquities which i have passed over as light matters and trampled under my feet some render it the iniquity of my ways others my transgressions which are like slips and slidings of the heel and after all might not this expression so harsh and odd to english ears have been very natural and obvious in the hebrew tongue which as every other language had its idioms the force and propriety whereof may as easily be conceived lost in a long tract of time as the signification of some hebrew words which are not now intelligible though no body doubts but they had once a meaning as well as the other words of that language granting therefore that certain passages in the holy scripture may not be understood it will not thence follow that its penmen wrote nonsense for i conceive nonsense to be one thing and unintelligible another cri an english gentleman of my acquaintance one day entertaining some foreigners at his house sent a servant to know the occasion of a sudden tumult in the yard who brought him word the horses were fallen together by the ears his guests inquiring what the matter was he translates it literally les chevaux sont tombez ensemble par les oreilles which made them stare what expressed a very plain sense in the original english being incomprehensible when rendered word for word into french and i remember to have heard a man excuse the bulls of his countrymen by supposing them so many literal translations euph but not to grow tedious i refer to the critics and and commentators where you will find the use of this remark which clearing up several obscure passages you took for nonsense may possibly incline you to suspect your own judgment of the rest in this very psalm you have pitched on the good sense and moral contained in what follows should methinks make a candid reader judge favorably of the original sense of the author in that part which he could not understand say alciphron in reading the classics do you forthwith conclude every passage to be nonsense that you cannot make sense of alc by no means difficulties must be supposed to rise from different idioms old customs hints and allusions clear in one time or place and obscure in another euph and why will you not judge of scripture by the same rule those sources of obscurity you mention are all common both to sacred and profane writings and there is no doubt but an exacter knowledge in language and circumstances would in both cause difficulties to vanish like shades before the light of the sun jeremiah to describe a furious invader says behold he shall come up as a lion from the swelling of jordan against the habitation of the strong one would be apt to think this passage odd and improper and that it had been more reasonable to have said a lion from the mountain or the desert but travelers as an ingenious man observes who have seen the river jordan bounded by low lands with many reeds or thickets affording shelter to wild beasts which being suddenly dislodged by a rapid overflowing of the river rush into the upland country perceive the force and propriety of the comparison and that the difficulty proceeds not from nonsense in the writer but from ignorance in the reader it is needless to amass together instances which may be found in every commentator i only beg leave to observe that sometimes men looking higher or deeper than they need for a profound or remote sense overlook the natural obvious sense lying if i may so say at their feet and so make difficulties instead of finding them this seems to be the case of that celebrated passage which has created so much work in st pauls first epistle to the corinthians what shall they do which are baptized for the dead if the dead rise not at all why are they then baptized for the dead i remember to have heard this text explained by laches the vicar of our parish to my neighbor lycon who was much perplexed about its meaning if it had been translated as it might very justly baptized for the sake of the dead i do not see said laches why people should be puzzled about the sense of this passage for tell me i beseech you for whose sake do you think those christians were baptized for whose sake answered lycon but their own how do you mean for their own sake in this life or the next doubtless in the next for it was plain they could get nothing by it in this they were then replied laches baptized not for the sake of themselves while living but for the sake of themselves when dead not for the living but the dead i grant it baptism therefore must have been to them a fruitless thing if the dead rise not at all it must whence laches inferred that st pauls argument was clear and pertinent for the resurrection and lycon allowed it to be argumentum ad hominem to those who had sought baptism there is then concluded laches no necessity for supposing that living men were in those days baptized instead of those who died without baptism or of running into any other odd suppositions or strained and farfetched interpretations to make sense of this passage alc here and there a difficult passage may be cleared but there are many which no art or wit of man can account for what say you to those discoveries made by some of our learned writers of false citations from the old testament found in the gospel euph that some few passages are cited by the writers of the new testament out of the old and by the fathers out of the new which are not in so many words to be found in them is no new discovery of minute philosophers but known and observed long before by christian writers who have made no scruple to grant that some things might have been inserted by careless or mistaken transcribers into the text from the margin others left out and others altered whence so many various readings but these are things of small moment and that all other ancient authors have been subject to and upon which no point of doctrine depends which may not be proved without them nay further if it be any advantage to your cause it has been observed that the eighteenth psalm as recited in the twenty second chapter of the second book of samuel varies in above forty places if you regard every little verbal or literal difference and that a critic may now and then discover small variations is what no body can deny but to make the most of these concessions what can you infer from them more than that the design of the holy scripture was not to make us exactly knowing in circumstantials and that the spirit did not dictate every particle and syllable or preserve them from every minute alteration by miracle which to believe would look like rabinical superstition alc but what marks of divinity can possibly be in writings which do not reach the exactness even of humane art euph i never thought nor expected that the holy scripture should show it self divine by a circumstantial accuracy of narration by exactness of method by strictly observing the rules of rhetoric grammar and criticism in harmonious periods in elegant and choice expressions or in technical definitions and partitions these things would look too like a humane composition methinks there is in that simple unaffected artless unequal bold figurative style of the holy scripture a character singularly great and majestic and that looks more like divine inspiration than any other composition that i know but as i said before i shall not dispute a point of criticism with the gentlemen of your sect who it seems are the modern standard for wit and taste alc well i shall not insist on small slips or the inaccuracy of citing or transcribing and i freely own that repetitions want of method or want of exactness in circumstances are not the things that chiefly stick with me no more than the plain patriarchal manners or the peculiar usages and customs of the jews and first christians so different from ours and that to reject the scripture on such accounts would be to act like those french wits who censure homer because they do not find in him the style notions and manners of their own age and country was there nothing else to divide us i should make no great difficulty of owning that a popular uncorrect style might answer the general ends of revelation as well perhaps as a more critical and exact one but the obscurity still sticks with me methinks if the supreme being had spoke to man he would have spoke clearly to him and that the word of god should not need a comment  viii euph you seem alciphron to think obscurity a defect but if it should prove to be no defect there would then be no force in this objection alc i grant there would not euph pray tell me are not speech and style instrumental to convey thoughts and notions to beget knowledge opinion and assent alc this is true euph and is not the perfection of an instrument to be measured by the use to which it is subservient alc it is euph what therefore is a defect in one instrument may be none in another for instance edged tools are in general designed to cut but the uses of an ax and a razor being different it is no defect in an ax that it has not the keen edge of a razor nor in a razor that it has not the weight or strength of an ax alc i acknowledge this to be true euph and may we not say in general that every instrument is perfect which answers the purpose or intention of him who uses it alc we may euph hence it seems to follow that no mans speech is defective in point of clearness though it should not be intelligible to all men if it be sufficiently so to those who he intended should understand it or though it should not in all parts be equally clear or convey a perfect knowledge where he intended only an imperfect hint alc it seems so euph ought we not therefore to know the intention of the speaker to be able to know whether his style be obscure through defect or design alc we ought euph but is it possible for man to know all the ends and purposes of gods revelations alc it is not euph how then can you tell but the obscurity of some parts of scripture may well consist with the purpose which you know not and consequently be no argument against its coming from god the books of holy scripture were written in ancient languages at distant times on sundry occasions and very different subjects is it not therefore reasonable to imagine that some parts or passages might have been clearly enough understood by those for whose proper use they were principally designed and yet seem obscure to us who speak another language and live in other times is it at all absurd or unsuitable to the notion we have of god or man to suppose that god may reveal and yet reveal with a reserve upon certain remote and sublime subjects content to give us hints and glimpses rather than views may we not also suppose from the reason of things and the analogy of nature that some points which might otherwise have been more clearly explained were left obscure merely to encourage our diligence and modesty two virtues which if it might not seem disrespectful to such great men i would recommend to the minute philosophers lysicles replied this indeed is excellent you expect that men of sense and spirit should in great humility put out their eyes and blindly swallow all the absurdities and nonsense that shall be offered to them for divine revelation euph on the contrary i would have them open their eyes look sharply and try the spirit whether it is of god and not supinely and ignorantly condemn in the gross all religions together piety with superstition truth for the sake of error matters of fact for the sake of fictions a conduct which at first sight would seem absurd in history physic or any other branch of humane inquiry but to compare the christian system or holy scriptures with other pretenses to divine revelation to consider impartially the doctrines precepts and events therein contained weigh them in the balance with any other religious natural moral or historical accounts and diligently to examine all those proofs internal and external that for so many ages have been able to influence and persuade so many wise learned and inquisitive men perhaps they might find in it certain peculiar characters which sufficiently distinguish it from all other religions and pretended revelations whereon to ground a reasonable faith in which case i leave them to consider whether it would be right to reject with peremptory scorn a revelation so distinguished and attested upon account of obscurity in some parts of it and whether it would seem beneath men of their sense and spirit to acknowledge that for ought they know a light inadaequate to things may yet be adaequate to the purpose of providence and whether it might be unbecoming their sagacity and critical skill to own that literal translations from books in an ancient oriental tongue wherein there are so many peculiarities as to the manner of writing the figures of speech and structure of the phrase so remote from all our modern idioms and in which we have no other coaeval writings extant might well be obscure in many places especially such as treat of subjects sublime and difficult in their own nature or allude to things customs or events very distant from our knowledge and lastly whether it might not become their character as impartial and unprejudiced men to consider the bible in the same light they would profane authors they are apt to make great allowance for transpositions omissions and literal errors of transcribers in other ancient books and very great for the difference of style and manner especially in eastern writings such as the remains of zoroaster and confucius and why not in the prophets in reading horace or persius to make out the sense they will be at the pains to discover a hidden drama and why not in solomon or st paul i hear there are certain ingenious men who despise king davids poetry and yet profess to admire homer and pindar if there be no prejudice or affectation in this let them but make a literal version from those authors into english prose and they will then be better able to judge of the psalms alc you may discourse and exspatiate but notwithstanding all you have said or shall say it is a clear point that a revelation which does not reveal can be no better than a contradiction in terms euph tell me alciphron do you not acknowledge the light of the sun to be the most glorious production of providence in this natural world alc suppose i do euph this light nevertheless which you cannot deny to be of gods making shines only on the surface of things shines not at all in the night shines imperfectly in the twilight is often interrupted refracted and obscured represents distant things and small things dubiously imperfectly or not at all is this true or no alc it is euph should it not follow therefore that to expect in this world a light from god without any mixture of shade or mystery would be departing from the rule and analogy of the creation and that consequently it is no argument the light of revelation is not divine because it may not be so clear and full as you expect alc as i profess my self candid and indifferent throughout this debate i must needs own you say some plausible things as a man of argument will never fail to do in vindication of his prejudices  ix but to deal plainly i must tell you once for all that you may question and answer illustrate and enlarge for ever without being able to convince me that the christian religion is of divine revelation i have said several things and have many more to say which believe me have weight not only with my self but with many great men my very good friends and will have weight whatever euphranor can say to the contrary euph o alciphron i envy you the happiness of such acquaintance but as my lot fallen in this remote corner deprives me of that advantage i am obliged to make the most of this opportunity which you and lysicles have put into my hands i consider you as two able surgeons and you were pleased to consider me as a patient whose cure you have generously undertaken now a patient must have full liberty to explain his case and tell all his symptoms the concealing or palliating of which might prevent a perfect cure you will be pleased therefore to understand me not as objecting to or arguing against either your skill or medicines but only as setting forth my own case and the effects they have upon me say alciphron did you not give me to understand that you would extirpate my prejudices alc it is true a good physician eradicates every fiber of the disease come you shall have a patient hearing euph pray was it not the opinion of plato that god inspired particular men as organs or trumpets to proclaim and sound forth his oracles to the world plato in ione and was not the same opinion also embraced by others the greatest writers of antiquity cri socrates seems to have thought that all true poets spoke by inspiration and tully that there was no extraordinary genius without it this has made some of our affected freethinkers attempt to pass themselves upon the world for enthusiasts alc what would you infer from all this euph i would infer that inspiration should seem nothing impossible or absurd but rather agreeable to the light of reason and the notions of mankind and this i suppose you will acknowledge having made it an objection against a particular revelation that there are so many pretenses to it throughout the world alc o euphranor he who looks into the bottom of things and resolves them into their first principles is not easily amused with words the word inspiration sounds indeed big but let us if you please take an original view of the thing signified by it to inspire is a word borrowed from the latin and strictly taken means no more than to breathe or blow in nothing therefore can be inspired but what can be blown or breathed and nothing can be so but wind or vapor which indeed may fill or puff up men with fanatical and hypochondriacal ravings this sort of inspiration i very readily admit euph what you say is subtle and i know not what effect it might have upon me if your profound discourse did not hinder its own operation alc how so euph tell me alciphron do you discourse or do you not to me it seems that you discourse admirably alc be that as it will it is certain i discourse euph but when i endeavor to look into the bottom of things behold a scruple rises in my mind how this can be for to discourse is a word of latin derivation which originally signifies to run about and a man cannot run about but he must change place and move his legs so long therefore as you sit on this bench you cannot be said to discourse solve me this difficulty and then perhaps i may be able to solve yours alc you are to know that discourse is a word borrowed from sensible things to express an invisible action of the mind reasoning or inferring one thing from another and in this translated sense we may be said to discourse though we sit still euph and may we not as well conceive that the term inspiration might be borrowed from sensible things to denote an action of god in an extraordinary manner influencing exciting and enlightening the mind of a prophet or an apostle who in this secondary figurative and translated sense may truly be said to be inspired though there should be nothing in the case of that wind or vapor implied in the original sense of the word it seems to me that we may by looking into our own minds plainly perceive certain instincts impulses and tendencies which at proper periods and occasions spring up unaccountably in the soul of man we observe very visible signs of the same in all other animals and these things being ordinary and natural what hinders but we may conceive it possible for the humane mind upon an extraordinary account to be moved in an extraordinary manner and its faculties stirred up and actuated by a supernatural power that there are and have been and are likely to be wild visions and hypochondriacal ravings no body can deny but to infer from thence that there are no true inspirations would be too like concluding that some men are not in their senses because other men are fools and though i am no prophet and consequently cannot pretend to a clear notion of this matter yet i shall not therefore take upon me to deny but a true prophet or inspired person might have had as certain means of discerning between divine inspiration and hypochondriacal fancy as you can between sleeping and waking till you have proved the contrary you may meet in the book of jeremiah with this passage the prophet that has a dream let him tell a dream and he that has my word let him speak my word faithfully what is the chaff to the wheat says the lord is not my word like as a fire says the lord and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces you see here a distinction made between wheat and chaff true and spurious with the mighty force and power of the former but i beg pardon for quoting scripture to you i make my appeal to the general sense of mankind and the opinion of the wisest heathens which seems sufficient to conclude divine inspiration possible if not probable at least till you prove the contrary  x alc the possibility of inspirations and revelations i do not think it necessary to deny make the best you can of this concession euph jerem c xxiii       now what is allowed possible we may suppose in fact alc we may euph let us then suppose that god had been pleased to make a revelation to men and that he inspired some as a means to instruct others having supposed this can you deny that their inspired discourses and revelations might have been committed to writing or that being written after a long tract of time they might become in several places obscure that some of them might even originally have been less clear than others or that they might suffer some alteration by frequent transcribing as other writings are known to have done is it not even very probable that all these things would happen alc i grant it euph and granting this with what pretense can you reject the holy scriptures as not being divine upon the account of such signs or marks as you acknowledge would probably attend a divine revelation transmitted down to us through so many ages alc but allowing all that in reason you can desire and granting that this may account for some obscurity may reconcile some small differences or satisfy us how some difficulties might arise by inserting omitting or changing here and there a letter a word or perhaps a sentence yet these are but small matters in respect of the much more considerable and weighty objections i could produce against the confessed doctrines or subject matter of those writings let us see what is contained in these sacred books and then judge whether it is probable or possible such revelations should ever have been made by god now i defy the wit of man to contrive any thing more extrayagant than the accounts we there find of apparitions devils miracles god manifest in the flesh regeneration grace selfdenial resurrection of the dead and such like aegri somnia things so odd unaccountable and remote from the apprehension of mankind you may as soon wash a blackamore white as clear them of absurdity no critical skill can justify them no tradition recommend them i will not say for divine revelations but even for the inventions of men of sense euph i had always a great opinion of your sagacity but now alciphron i consider you as something more than man else how should it be possible for you to know what or how far it may be proper for god to reveal methinks it may consist with all due deference to the greatest of humane understandings to suppose them ignorant of many things which are not suited to their faculties or lie out of their reach even the counsels of princes lie often beyond the ken of their subjects who can only know so much as is revealed by those at the helm and are often unqualified to judge of the usefulness and tendency even of that till in due time the scheme unfolds and is accounted for by succeeding events that many points contained in holy scripture are remote from the common apprehensions of mankind cannot be denied but i do not see that it follows from thence they are not of divine revelation on the contrary should it not seem reasonable to suppose that a revelation from god should contain something different in kind or more excellent in degree than what lay open to the common sense of men or could even be discovered by the most sagacious philosopher accounts of separate spirits good or bad prophesies miracles and such things are undoubtedly strange but i would fain see how you can prove them impossible or absurd alc some things there are so evidently absurd that it would be almost as silly to disprove them as to believe them and i take these to be of that class  xi euph but is it not possible some men may show as much prejudice and narrowness in rejecting all such accounts as others might easiness and credulity in admitting them i never durst make my own observation or experience the rule and measure of things spiritual supernatural or relating to another world because i should think it a very bad one even for the visible and natural things of this it would be judging like the siamese who was positive it did not freeze in holland because he had never known such a thing as hard water or ice in his own country i cannot comprehend why any one who admits the union of the soul and body should pronounce it impossible for the humane nature to be united to the divine in a manner ineffable and incomprehensible by reason neither can i see any absurdity in admitting that sinful man may become regenerate or a new creature by the grace of god reclaiming him from a carnal life to a spiritual life of virtue and holiness and since the being governed by sense and appetite is contrary to the happiness and perfection of a rational creature i do not at all wonder that we are prescribed selfdenial as for the resurrection of the dead i do not conceive it so very contrary to the analogy of nature when i behold vegetables left to rot in the earth rise up again with new life and vigor or a worm to all appearance dead change its nature and that which in its first being crawled on the earth become a new species and fly abroad with wings and indeed when i consider that the soul and body are things so very different and heterogeneous i can see no reason to be positive that the one must necessarily be extinguished upon the dissolution of the other especially since i find in my self a strong natural desire of immortality and i have not observed that natural appetites are wont to be given in vain or merely to be frustrated upon the whole those points which you account extravagant and absurd i dare not pronounce to be so till i see good reason for it  xii cri no alciphron your positive airs must not pass for proofs nor will it suffice to say things are contrary to common sense to make us think they are so by common sense i suppose should be meant either the general sense of mankind or the improved reason of thinking men now i believe that all those articles you have with so much capacity and fire at once summed up and exploded may be shown to be not disagreeable much less contrary to common sense in one or other of these acceptations that the gods might appear and converse among men and that the divinity might inhabit humane nature were points allowed by the heathens and for this i appeal to their poets and philosophers whose testimonies are so numerous and clear that it would be an affront to repeat them to a man of any education and though the notion of a devil may not be so obvious or so fully described yet there appear plain traces of it either from reason or tradition the latter platonists as porphyry and iamblichus are very clear in the point allowing that evil demons delude and tempt hurt and possess mankind that the ancient greeks chaldaeans and egyptians believed both good and bad angels may be plainly collected from plato plutarch and the chaldaean oracles origin observes that almost all the gentiles who held the being of demons allowed there were bad ones origin l   contra celsum  there is even something as early as homer that is thought by the learned cardinal bessarion in calumniat platonis l   c   to allude to the fall of satan in the acount of ate whom the poet represents as cast down from heaven by jove and then wandering about the earth doing mischief to mankind this same ate is said by hesiod to be the daughter of discord and by euripides in his hippolitus is mentioned as a tempter to evil and it is very remarkable that plutarch in his book de vitando aere alieno speaks after empedocles of certain demons that fell from heaven and were banished by god  nor is that less remarkable which is observed by ficinus from pherecydes syrus that there had been a downfall of demons who revolted from god and that ophioneus the old serpent was head of that rebellious crew vid argum in phaedrum platonis  then as to other articles let any one consider what the pythagoreans taught of the purgation and  or deliverance of the soul what most philosophers but especially the stoics of subduing our passions what plato and hierocles have said of forgiving injuries what the acute and sagacious aristotle writes in his ethics to nicomachus of the spiritual and divine life that life which according to him is too excellent to be thought humane insomuch as man so far forth as man cannot attain to it but only so far forth as he has something divine in him and particularly let him reflect on what socrates taught to wit that virtue is not to be learned from men that it is the gift of god and that good men are not good by virtue of humane care or diligence  vid plat in protag and alibi passim  let any man who really thinks but consider what other thinking men have thought who cannot be supposed prejudiced in favor of revealed religion and he will see cause if not to think with reverence of the christian doctrines of grace selfdenial regeneration sanctification and the rest even the most mysterious at least to judge more modestly and warily than those who shall with a confident air pronounce them absurd and repugnant to the reason of mankind and in regard to a future state the common sense of the gentile world modern or ancient and the opinions of the wisest men of antiquity are things so well known that i need say nothing about them to me it seems the minute philosophers when they appeal to reason and common sense mean only the sense of their own party a coin how current soever among themselves that other men will bring to the touchstone and pass for no more than it is worth lys be those notions agreeable to what or whose sense they may they are not agreeable to mine and if i am thought ignorant for this i pity those who think me so  xiii i enjoy my self and follow my own courses without remorse or fear which i should not do if my head were filled with enthusiasm whether gentile or christian philosophical or revealed it is all one to me let others know or believe what they can and make the best on it i for my part am happy and safe in my ignorance cri perhaps not so safe neither lys why surely you will not pretend that ignorance is criminal cri ignorance alone is not a crime but that wilful ignorance affected ignorance ignorance from sloth or conceited ignorance is a fault might easily be proved by the testimony of heathen writers and it needs no proof to show that if ignorance be our fault we cannot be secure in it as an excuse lys honest crito seems to hint that a man should take care to inform himself while alive lest his neglect be punished when he is dead nothing is so pusillanimous and unbecoming a gentleman as fear nor could you take a likelier course to fix and rivet a man of honor in guilt than by attempting to frighten him out of it this is the stale absurd stratagem of priests and that which makes them and their religion more odious and contemptible to me than all the other articles put together cri i would fain know why it may not be reasonable for a man of honor or any man who has done amiss to fear guilt is the natural parent of fear and nature is not used to make men fear where there is no occasion that impious and profane men should expect divine punishment does not seem so absurd to conceive and that under this expectation they should be uneasy and even afraid how consistent soever it may or may not be with honor i am sure consists with reason lys that thing of hell and eternal punishment is the most absurd as well as the most disagreeable thought that ever entered into the head of mortal man cri but you must own that it is not an absurdity peculiar to christians since socrates that great freethinker of athens thought it probable there may be such a thing as impious men for ever punished in hell vid platon in gorgia  it is recorded of this same socrates that he has been often known to think for four and twenty hours together fixed in the same posture and wrapped up in meditation lys our modern freethinkers are a more lively sort of men those old philosophers were most of them whimsical they had in my judgment a dry narrow timorous way of thinking which by no means came up to the frank humor of our times cri but i appeal to your own judgment if a man who knows not the nature of the soul can be assured by the light of reason whether it is mortal or immortal  an simul intereat nobiscum morte perempta an tenebras orci visat vastasque lacunas lys but what if i know the nature of the soul what if i have been taught that whole secret by a modern freethinker a man of science who discovered it not by a tiresome introversion of his faculties not by amusing himself in a labyrinth of notions or stupidly thinking for whole days and nights together but by looking into things and observing the analogy of nature  xiv this great man is a philosopher by fire who has made many processes upon vegetables it is his opinion that men and vegetables are really of the same species that animals are moving vegetables and vegetables fixed animals that the mouths of the one and the roots of the other serve to the same use differing only in position that blossoms and flowers answer to the most indecent and concealed parts in the humane body that vegetable and animal bodies are both alike organized and that in both there is life or a certain motion and circulation of juices through proper tubes or vessels i shall never forget this able mans unfolding the nature of the soul in the following manner the soul said he is that specific form or principle from whence proceed the distinct qualities or properties of things now as vegetables are a more simple and less perfect compound and consequently more easily analyzed than animals we will begin with the contemplation of the souls of vegetables know then that the soul of any plant rosemary for instance is neither more nor less than its essential oil upon this depends its peculiar fragrance taste and medicinal virtues or in other words its life and operations separate or extract this essential oil by chymic art and you get the soul of the plant what remains being a dead carcass without any one property or virtue of the plant which is preserved entire in the oil a dram whereof goes further than several pounds of the plant now this same essential oil is it self a composition of sulphur and salt or of a gross unctuous substance and a fine subtle principle or volatile salt imprisoned therein this volatile salt is properly the essence of the soul of the plant containing all its virtue and the oil is the vehicle of this most subtle part of the soul or that which fixes and individuates it and as upon separation of this oil from the plant the plant died so a second death or death of the soul ensues upon the resolution of this essential oil into its principles as appears by leaving it exposed for some time to the open air so that the volatile salt or spirit may fly off after which the oil remains dead and insipid but without any sensible diminution of its weight by the loss of that volatile essence of the soul that ethereal aura that spark of entity which returns and mixes with the solar light the universal soul of the world and only source of life whether vegetable animal or intellectual which differ only according to the grossness or fineness of the vehicles and the different textures of the natural alembics or in other words the organized bodies where the abovementioned volatile essence inhabits and is elaborated where it acts and is acted upon this chemical system lets you at once into the nature of the soul and accounts for all it is phenomenon in that compound which is called man the soul or essential oil is what commonly goes by the name of animal spirit for you must know it is a point agreed by chemists that spirits are nothing but the more subtle oils now in proportion as the essential oil of man is more subtle than that of other creatures the volatile salt that impregnates it is more at liberty to act which accounts for those specific properties and actions of humane kind which distinguish them above other creatures hence you may learn why among the wise ancients salt was another name for wit and in our times a dull man is said to be insipid or insulse aromatic oils maturated by great length of time turn to salts this shows why humane kind grow wiser by age and what i have said of the twofold death or dissolution first of the compound by separating the soul from the organical body and secondly of the soul it self by dividing the volatile salt from the oil illustrates and explains that notion of certain ancient philosophers that as the man was a compound of soul and body so the soul was compounded of the mind or intellect and its ethereal vehicle and that the separation of soul and body or death of the man is after a long tract of time succeeded by a second death of the soul it self to wit the separation or deliverance of the intellect from its vehicle and reunion with the sun euph o lysicles your ingenious friend has opened a new scene and explained the most obscure and difficult points in the clearest and easiest manner lys i must own this account of things struck my fancy i am no great lover of creeds or systems but when a notion is reasonable and grounded on experience i know how to value it cri in good earnest lysicles do you believe this account to be true lys why then in good earnest i dont know whether i do or no but i can assure you the ingenious artist himself has not the least doubt about it and to believe an artist in his art is a just maxim and short way to science cri but what relation has the soul of man to chymic art the same reason that bids me trust a skilful artist in his art inclines me to suspect him out of his art men are too apt to reduce unknown things to the standard of what they know and bring a prejudice or tincture from things they have been conversant in to judge thereby of things in which they have not been conversant i have known a fiddler gravely teach that the soul was harmony a geometrician very positive that the soul must be extended and a physician who having pickled half a doozen embryos and dissected as many rats and frogs grew conceited and affirmed there was no soul at all and that it was a vulgar error lys my notions sit easy i shall not engage in pedantic disputes about them they who dont like them may leave them euph this i suppose is said much like a gentelman  xv but pray lysicles tell me whether the clergy come within that general rule of yours that an artist may be trusted in his art lys by no means euph why so lys because i take my self to know as much of those matters as they do euph but you allow that in any other profession one who has spent much time and pains may attain more knowledge than a man of equal or better parts who never made it his particular business lys i do euph and nevertheless in things religious and divine you think all men equally knowing lys i do not say all men but i think all men of sense competent judges euph what are the divine attributes and dispensations to mankind the true end and happiness of rational creatures with the means of improving and perfecting their beings more easy and obvious points than those which make the subject of every common profession lys perhaps not but one thing i know some things are so manifestly absurd that no authority shall make me give into them for instance if all mankind should pretend to persuade me that the son of god was born upon earth in a poor family was spit upon buffeted and crucified lived like a beggar and died like a thief i should never believe one syllable of it common sense shows every one what figure it would be decent for an earthly prince or ambassador to make and the son of god upon an ambassy from heaven must needs have made an appearance beyond all others of great eclat and in all respects the very reverse of that which jesus christ is reported to have made even by his own historians euph o lysicles though i had ever so much mind to approve and applaud your ingenious reasoning yet i dare not assent to this for fear of crito lys why so euph because he observed just now that men judge of things they do not know by prejudices from things they do know and i fear he would object that you who have been conversant in the grand monde having your head filled with a notion of attendants and equipage and liveries the familiar badges of humane grandeur are less able to judge of that which is truly divine and that one who had seen less and thought more would be apt to imagine a pompous parade of worldly greatness not the most becoming the author of a spiritual religion that was designed to wean men from the world and raise them above it cri do you think lysicles if a man should make his entrance into london in a rich suit of clothes with a hundred gilt coaches and a thousand laced footmen that this would be a more divine appearance and have more of true grandeur in it than if he had power with a word to heal all manner of diseases to raise the dead to life and still the raging of the winds and sea lys without all doubt it must be very agreeable to common sense to suppose that he could restore others to life who could not save his own you tell us indeed that he rose again from the dead but what occasion was there for him to die the just for the unjust the son of god for wicked men and why in that individual place why at that very time above all others why did he not make his appearance earlier and preach in all parts of the world that the benefit might have been more extensive account for all these points and reconcile them if you can to the common notions and plain sense of mankind cri and what if those as well as many other points should lie out of the road that we are acquainted with must we therefore explode them and make it a rule to condemn every proceeding as senseless that does not square with the vulgar sense of man if the precepts and certain primary tenets of religion appear in the eye of reason good and useful and if they are also found to be so by their effects we may for the sake of them admit certain other points or doctrines recommended with them to have a good tendency to be right and true although we cannot discern their goodness or truth by the mere light of humane reason which may well be supposed an insufficient judge of the proceedings counsels and designs of providence and this suffices to make our conviction reasonable  xvi it is an allowed point that no man can judge of this or that part of a machine taken by it self without knowing the whole the mutual relation or dependence of its parts and the end for which it was made and as this is a point acknowledged in corporeal and natural things ought we not by a parity of reason to suspend our judgment of a single unaccountable part of the divine economy till we are more fully acquainted with the moral system or world of spirits and are let into the designs of gods providence and have an extensive view of his dispensations past present and future alas lysicles what do you know even of your self whence you come what you are or whither you are going to me it seems that a minute philosopher is like a conceited spectator who never looked behind the scenes and yet would judge of the machinery who from a transient glimpse of a part only of some one scene would take upon him to censure the plot of a play lys as to the plot i will not say but in half a scene a man may judge of an absurd actor with what color or pretext can you justify the vindictive froward whimsical behavior of some inspired teachers or prophets particulars that serve neither for profit nor pleasure i make a shift to forget but in general the truth of this charge i do very well remember cri you need be at no pains to prove a point i shall neither justify nor deny that there have been humane passions infirmities and defects in persons inspired by god i freely own nay that very wicked men have been inspired as balaam for instance and caiaphas cannot denied but what will you infer from thence can you prove it impossible that a weak or sinful man should become an instrument to the spirit of god for conveying his purpose to other sinners or that divine light may not as well as the light of the sun shine on a foul vessel without polluting its rays lys to make short work the right way would be to put out our eyes and not judge at all cri i do not say so but i think it would be right if some sanguine persons upon certain points suspected their own judgment alc but the very things said to be inspired taken by themselves and in their own nature are sometimes so wrong to say no worse that a man may pronounce them not to be divine at first sight without troubling his head about the system of providence or connection of events as one may say that grass is green without knowing or considering how it grows what uses it is subservient to or how it is connected with the mundane system thus for instance the spoiling of the egyptians and the extirpation of the canaanites every one at first glance sees to be cruel and unjust and may therefore without deliberating pronounce them unworthy of god cri but alciphron to judge rightly of these things may it not be proper to consider how long the israelites had wrought under those severe taskmasters of egypt what injuries and hardships they had sustained from them what crimes and abominations the canaanites had been guilty of what right god has to dispose of the things of this world to punish delinquents and to appoint both the manner and the instruments of his justice man who has not such right over his fellow creatures who is himself a fellowsinner with them who is liable to error as well as passion whose views are imperfect who is governed more by prejudice than the truth of things may not improbably deceive himself when he sets up for a judge of the proceedings of the holy omniscient impassive creator and governor of all things  xvii alc believe me crito men are never so industrious to deceive themselves as when they engage to defend their prejudices you would fain reason us out of all use of our reason can any thing be more irrational to forbid us to reason on the divine dispensations is to suppose they will not bear the test of reason or in other words that god acts without reason which ought not to be admitted no not in any single instance for if in one why not in another whoever therefore allows a god must allow that he always acts reasonably i will not therefore attribute to him actions and proceedings that are unreasonable he has given me reason to judge withal and i will judge by that unerring light lighted from the universal lamp of nature cri o alciphron as i frankly own the common remark to be true that when a man is against reason it is a shrewd sign reason is against him so i should never go about to dissuade any one much less one who so well knew the value of it from using that noble talent on the contrary upon all subjects of moment in my opinion a man ought to use his reason but then whether it may not be reasonable to use it with some deference to superior reason it will not perhaps be amiss to consider alc it must surely derogate from the wisdom of god to suppose his conduct cannot bear being inspected not even by the twilight of humane reason euph you allow then god to be wise alc i do euph what infinitely wise alc even infinitely euph his wisdom then far exceeds that of man alc vastly euph probably more than the wisdom of man that of a child alc without all question euph what think you alciphron must not the conduct of a parent seem very unaccountable to a child when its inclinations are thwarted when it is put to learn the letters when it is obliged to swallow bitter physic to part with what it likes and to suffer and do and see many things done contrary to its own judgment however reasonable or agreeable to that of others alc this i grant euph will it not therefore follow from hence by a parity of reason that the little child man when it takes upon it to judge of the schemes of parental providence and a thing of yesterday to criticize the economy of the ancient of days will it not follow i say that such a judge of such matters must be apt to make very erroneous judgments esteeming those things in themselves unaccountable which he cannot account for and concluding of some certain points from an appearance of arbitrary carriage toward him which is suited to his infancy and ignorance that they are in themselves capricious or absurd and cannot proceed from a wise just and benevolent god this single consideration if duly attended to would i verily think put an end to many conceited reasonings against revealed religion alc you would have us then conclude that things to our wisdom unaccountable may nevertheless proceed from an abyss of wisdom which our line cannot fathom and that prospects viewed but in part and by the broken tinged light of our intellects though to us they may seem disproportionate and monstrous may nevertheless appear quite otherwise to another eye and in a different situation in a word that as humane wisdom is but childish folly in respect of the divine so the wisdom of god may sometimes seem foolishness to men  xviii euph i would not have you make these conclusions unless in reason you ought to make them but if they are reasonable why should you not make them alc some things may seem reasonable at one time and not at another and i take this very apology you make for credulity and superstition to be one of those things when i view it in its principles it seems naturally to follow from just concessions but when i consider its consequences i cannot agree to it a man had as good abdicate his nature as disclaim the use of reason a doctrine is unaccountable therefore it must be divine euph credulity and superstition are qualities so disagreeable and degrading to humane nature so surely an effect of weakness and so frequently a cause of wickedness that i should be very much surprised to find a just course of reasoning lead to them i can never think that reason is a blind guide to folly or that there is any connection between truth and falsehood no more than i can think a things being unaccountable a proof that it is divine though at the same time i cannot help acknowledging it follows from your own avowed principles that a things being unaccountable or incomprehensible to our reason is no sure argument to conclude it is not divine especially when there are collateral proofs of its being so a child is influenced by the many sensible effects it has felt of paternal love and care and superior wisdom to believe and do several things with an implicit faith and obedience and if we in the same manner from the truth and reasonableness which we plainly see in so many points within our cognizance and the advantages which we experience from the seed of the gospel sown in good ground were disposed to an implicit belief of certain other points relating to schemes we do not know or subjects to which our talents are perhaps disproportionate i am tempted to think it might become our duty without dishonouring our reason which is never so much dishonored as when it is foiled and never in more danger of being foiled than by judging where it has neither means nor right to judge lys i would give a good deal to see that ingenious gamester glaucus have the handling of euphranor one night at our club i own he is a peg too high for me in some of his notions but then he is admirable at vindicating humane reason against the impositions of priestcraft  xix alc he would undertake to make it as clear as day light that there was nothing worth a straw in christianity but what every one knew or might know as well without as with it before as since jesus christ cri that great man it seems teaches that common sense alone is the pole star by which mankind ought to steer and that what is called revelation must be ridiculous because it is unnecessary and useless the natural talents of every man being sufficient to make him happy good and wise without any further correspondence with heaven either for light or aid euph i have already acknowledged how sensible i am that my situation in this obscure corner of the country deprives me of many advantages to be had from the conversation of ingenious men in town to make my self some amends i am obliged to converse with the dead and my own thoughts which last i know are of little weight against the authority of glaucus or such like great men in the minute philosophy but what shall we say to socrates for he too was of an opinion very different from that ascribed to glaucus alc for the present we need not insist on authorities ancient or modern or inquire which was the greater man socrates or glaucus though methinks for so much as authority can signify the present times gray and hoary with age and experience have a manifest advantage over those that are falsely called ancient but not to dwell on authorities i tell you in plain english euphranor we do not want your revelations and that for this plain reason those that are clear every body knew before and those that are obscure no body is the better for euph whether it was possible for mankind to have known all parts of the christian religion besides mysteries and positive institutions is not the question between us and that they actually did not know them is too plain to be denied this perhaps was for want of making a due use of reason but as to the usefulness of revelation it seems much the samething whether they could not know or would not be at the pains to know the doctrines revealed and as for those doctrines which were too obscure to penetrate or too sublime to reach by natural reason how far mankind may be the better for them is more i had almost said than even you or glaucus can tell  xx alc but whatever may be pretended as to obscure doctrines and dispensations all this has nothing to do with prophecies which being altogether relative to mankind and the events of this world to which our faculties are surely well enough proportioned one might expect should be very clear and such as might inform instead of puzzling us euph and yet it must be allowed that as some prophecies are clear there are others very obscure but left to my self i doubt i should never have inferred from thence that they were not divine in my own way of thinking i should have been apt to conclude that the prophecies we understand are a proof for inspiration but that those we do not understand are no proof against it inasmuch as for the latter our ignorance or the reserve of the holy spirit may account but for the other nothing for ought that i see can account but inspiration alc now i know several sagacious men who conclude very differently from you to wit that the one sort of prophecies are nonsense and the other contrived after the events behold the difference between a man of free thought and one of narrow principles euph it seems then they reject the revelations because they are obscure and daniels prophecies because they are clear alc either way a man of sense sees cause to suspect there has been foul play euph your men of sense are it seems hard to please alc our philosophers are men of piercing eyes euph i suppose such men never make transient judgments from transient views but always establish fixed conclusions upon a thorough inspection of things for my own part i dare not engage with a man who has examined those points so nicely as it may be presumed you have done but i could name some eminent writers of our own now living whose books on the subject of prophecy have given great satisfaction to gentlemen who pass for men of sense and learning here in the country alc you must know euphranor i am not at leisure to peruse the learned writings of divines on a subject which a man may see through with half an eye to me it is sufficient that the point it self is odd and out of the road of nature for the rest i leave them to dispute and settle among themselves where to fix the precise time when the scepter departed from judah or whether in daniels prophecy of the messiah we should compute by the chaldaean or the julian year my only conclusion concerning all such matters is that i will never trouble my self about them euph to an extraordinary genius who sees things with half an eye i know not what to say but for the rest of mankind one would think it should be very rash in them to conclude without much and exact inquiry on the unsafe side of a question which concerns their chief interest alc mark it well a true genius in pursuit of truth makes swift advances on the wings of general maxims while little minds creep and grovel amidst mean particularities i lay it down for a certain truth that by the fallacious arts of logic and criticism straining and forcing palliating patching and distinguishing a man may justify or make out any thing and this remark with one or two about prejudice saves me a world of trouble euph you alciphron who soar sublime on strong and free pinions vouchsafe to lend a helping hand to those whom you behold entangled in the birdlime of prejudice for my part i find it very possible to suppose prophecy may be divine although there should be some obscurity at this distance with respect to dates of time or kinds of years you your self own revelation possible and allowing this i can very easily conceive it may be odd and out of the road of nature i can without amazement meet in holy scripture diverse prophecies whereof i do not see the completion diverse texts i do not understand diverse mysteries above my comprehension and ways of god to me unaccountable why may not some prophecies relate to parts of history i am not well enough acquainted with or to events not yet come to pass it seems to me that prophecies unfathomed by the hearer or even the speaker himself have been afterward verified and understood in the event and it is one of my maxims that what has been may be though i rub my eyes and do my utmost to extricate my self from prejudice yet it still seems very possible to me that what i do not a more acute more attentive or more learned man may understand at least thus much is plain the difficulty of some points or passages does not hinder the clearness of others and those parts of scripture which we cannot interpret we are not bound to know the sense of what evil or what inconvenience if we cannot comprehend what we are not obliged to comprehend or if we cannot account for those things which it does not belong to us to account for scriptures not understood at one time or by one person may be understood at another time or by other persons may we not perceive by retrospect on what is past a certain progress from darker to lighter in the series of the divine economy toward man and may not future events clear up such points as at present exercise the faith of believers now i cannot help thinking such is the force either of truth or prejudice that in all this there is nothing strained or forced or which is not reasonable and natural to suppose  xxi alc well euphranor i will lend you a helping hand since you desire it but think fit to alter my method for you must know the main points of christian belief have been infused so early and inculcated so often by nurses paedagogues and priests that be the proofs ever so plain it is a hard matter to convince a mind thus tinctured and stained by arguing against revealed religion from its internal characters i shall therefore set my self to consider things in another light and examine your religion by certain external characters or circumstantials comparing the system of revelation with collateral accounts of ancient heathen writers and showing how ill it consists with them know then that the christian revelation supposing the jewish it follows that if the jewish be destroyed the christian must of course fall to the ground now to make short work i shall attack this jewish revelation in its head tell me are we not obliged if we believe the mosaic account of things to hold the world was created not quite six thousand years ago euph i grant we are alc what will you say now if other ancient records carry up the history of the world many thousand years beyond this period what if the egyptians and chinese have accounts extending to thirty or forty thousand years what if the former of these nations have observed twelve hundred eclipses during the space of forty eight thousand years before the time of alexander the great what if the chinese have also many observations antecedent to the jewish account of the creation what if the chaldaeans had been observing the stars for above four hundred thousand years and what shall we say if we have successions of kings and their reigns marked for several thousand years before the beginning of the world assigned by moses shall we reject the accounts and records of all other nations the most famous ancient and learned in the world and preserve a blind reverence for the legislator of the jews euph and pray if they deserve to be rejected why should we not reject them what if those monstrous chronologies contain nothing but names without actions and manifest fables what if those pretended observations of egyptians and chaldaeans were unknown or unregarded by ancient astronomers what if the jesuits have shown the inconsistency of the like chinese pretentions with the truth of the ephemerides what if the most ancient chinese observations allowed to be authentic are those of two fixed stars one in the winter solstice the other in the vernal equinox in the reign of their king yao which was since the flood bianchini histor univers c    alc you must give me leave to observe the romish missionaries are of small credit in this point euph but what knowledge have we or can we have of those chinese affairs but by their means the same persons that tell us of these accounts refute them if we reject their authority in one case what right have we to build upon it in another alc when i consider that the chinese have annals of more than forty thousand years and that they are a learned ingenious and accute people very curious and adicted to arts and sciences i profess i cannot help paying some regard to their accounts of time euph whatever advantage their situation and political maxims may have given them it does not appear they are so learned or so acute in point of science as the europeans the general character of the chinese if we may believe trigaltius and other writers is that they are men of a trifling and credulous curiosity addicted to search after the philosophers stone and a medicine to make men immortal to astrology fortunetelling and presages of all kinds their ignorance in nature and mathematics is evident from the great hand the jesuits make of that kind of knowledge among them but what shall we think of those extraordinary annals if the very chinese themselves give no credit to them for more than three thousand years before jesus christ if they do not pretend to have begun to write history above four thousand years ago and if the oldest books they have now extant in an intelligible character are not above two thousand years old one would think a man of your sagacity so apt to suspect every thing out of the common road of nature should not without the clearest proof admit those annals for authentic which record such strange things as the suns not setting for ten days and gold raining three days together tell me alciphron can you really believe these things without inquiring by what means the tradition was preserved through what hands it passed or what reception it met with or who first committed it to writing alc to omit the chinese and their story it will serve my purpose as well to build on the authority of manetho that learned egyptian priest who had such opportunities of searching into the most ancient accounts of time and copying into his dynasties the most venerable and authentic records inscribed on the pillars of hermes euph pray alciphron where were those chronological pillars to be seen alc in the scriadical land euph and where is that country alc i dont know euph how were those records preserved for so many ages down to the time of this hermes who is said to have been the first inventor of letters alc i do not know euph did any other writers before or since manetho pretend to have seen or transcribed or known any thing about these pillars alc not that i know euph or about the place where they are said to have been alc if they did it is more than i know euph do the greek authors that went into egypt and consulted the egyptian priests agree with these accounts of manetho alc suppose they do not euph does diodorus who lived since manetho follow cite or so much as mention this same manetho alc what will you infer from all this euph if i did not know you and your principles and how vigilantly you guard against imposture i should infer that you were a very credulous man for what can we call it but credulity to believe most incredible things on most slender authority such as fragments of an obscure writer disagreeing with all other historians supported by an obscure authority of hermess pillars for which you must take his word and which contain things so improbable as successions of gods and demigods for many thousand years vulcan alone having reigned nine thousand there is little in these venerable dynasties of manetho besides names and numbers and yet in that little we meet with very strange things that would be thought romantic in another writer for instance the nile overflowing with honey the moon grown bigger a speaking lamb seventy kings who reigned as many days one after another a king a day scal can isag l    if you are known alciphron to give credit to these things i fear you will lose the honor of being thought incredulous alc and yet these ridiculous fragments as you would represent them have been thought worth the pains and lucubrations of very learned men how can you account for the work that the great joseph scaliger and sir john marsham make about them euph i do not pretend to account for it to see scaliger add another julian period to make room for such things as manethos dynasties and sir john marsham take so much learned pains to piece patch and mend those obscure fragments to range them in synchronisms and try to adjust them with sacred chronology or make them consistent with themselves and other accounts is to me very strange and unaccountable why they or eusebius or yourself or any other learned man should imagine those things deserve any regard i leave you to explain  xxii alc after all it is not easy to conceive what should move not only manetho but also other egyptian priests long before his time to set up such great pretenses to antiquity all which however differing from one another agree in this that they overthrow the mosaic history how can this be accounted for without some real foundation what point of pleasure or profit or power could set men on forging successions of ancient names and periods of time for ages before the world began euph pray alciphron is there any thing so strange or singular in this vain humor of extending the antiquity of nations beyond the truth has it not been observed in most parts of the world does it not even in our own times show it self especially among those dependent and subdued people who have little else to boast of to pass over others of our fellow subjects who in proportion as they are below their neighbors in wealth and power lay claim to a more remote antiquity are not the pretensions of irish men in this way known to be very great if i may trust my memory o flaherty in his ogygia mentions some transactions in ireland before the flood the same humor and from the same cause appears to have prevailed in sicily a country for some centuries past subject to the dominion of foreigners during which time the sicilians have published diverse fabulous accounts concerning the original and antiquity of their cities wherein they vye with each other it is pretended to be proved by ancient inscriptions whose existence or authority seems on a level with that of hermess pillars that palermo was founded in the days of the patriarch isaac by a colony of hebrews phoenicians and syrians and that a grandson of esau had been governor of a tower subsisting within these two hundred years in that city fazelli hist sicul decad   lib    the antiquity of messina has been carried still higher by some who would have us think it was enlarged by nimrod reina notizie istoriche di messina  the like pretensions are made by catania and other towns of that island who have found authors of as good credit as manetho to support them now i should be glad to know why the egyptians a subdued people may not probably be supposed to have invented fabulous accounts from the same motive and like others valued themselves on extravagant pretensions to antiquity when in all other respects they were so much inferior to their masters that people had been successively conquered by ethiopians assyrians babylonians persians and grecians before it appears that those wonderful dynastics of manetho and the pillars of hermes were ever heard of as they had been by the two first of those nations before the time of solon himself the earliest greek that is known to have consulted the priests of egypt whose accounts were so extravagant that even the greek historians though unacquainted with holy scripture were far from given an entire credit to them herodotus making a report upon their authority says those to whom such things seem credible may make the best of them for himself declaring that it was his purpose to write what he heard herodotus in euterpe  and both he and diodorus do on diverse occasions show the same diffidence in the narratives of those egyptian priests and as we observed of the egyptians it is no less certain that the phoenicians assyrians and chaldaeans were each a conquered and reduced people before the rest of the world appear to have heard any thing of their pretensions to so remote antiquity cri but what occasion is there to be at any pains to account for the humor of fabulous writers is it not sufficient to see that they relate absurdities that they are unsupported by any foreign evidence that they do not appear to have been in credit even among their own countrymen and that they are inconsistent one with another that men should have the vanity to impose on the world by false accounts is nothing strange it is much more so that after what has been done toward undeceiving the world by so many learned crities there should be men found capable of being abused by those paltry scraps of manetho berosus ctesias or the like fabulous or counterfeit writers alc give me leave to observe those learned critics may prove to be ecclesiastics perhaps some of them papists cri what do you think of sir isaac newton was he either papist or ecclesiastic perhaps you may not allow him to have been in sagacity or force of mind equal to the great men of the minute philosophy but it cannot be denied that he had read and thought much upon the subject and that the result of his inquiry was a perfect contempt of all those celebrated rivals to moses alc it has been observed by ingenious men that sir isaac newton though a layman was deeply prejudiced witness his great regard to the bible cri and the same may be said of mr lock mr boil lord bacon and other famous laymen who however knowing in some points must nevertheless be allowed not to have attained that keen discernment which is the peculiar distinction of your sect  xxiii but perhaps there may be other reasons beside prejudice to incline a man to give moses the preference on the truth of whose history the government manners and religion of his countrymen were founded and framed of whose history there are manifest traces in the most ancient books and traditions of the gentiles particularly of the brachmans and persees whose history is confirmed by the late invention of arts and sciences the gradual peopling of the world the very names of ancient nations and even by the authority and arguments of that renowned philosopher lucretius who on other points is so much admired and followed by those of your sect not to mention that the continual decrease of fluids the sinking of hills and the diminution of planetary motions afford so many natural proofs which show this world had a beginning as the civil or historical proofs abovementioned do plainly point out this beginning to have been about the time assigned in holy scripture after all which i beg leave to add one observation more to any one who considers that on digging into the earth such quantities of shells and in some places bones and horns of animals are found sound and entire after having lain there in all probability some thousands of years it should seem probable that gems medals and implements in metal or stone might have lasted entire buried under ground forty or fifty thousand years if the world had been so old how comes it then to pass that no remains are found no antiquities of those numerous ages preceding the scripture accounts of time no fragments of buildings no public monuments no intaglias cammeos statues basso relievos medals inscriptions utensils or artificial works of any kind are ever discovered which may bear testimony to the existence of those mighty empires those successions of monarchs heroes and demigods for so many thousand years let us look forward and suppose ten or twenty thousand years to come during which time we will suppose that plagues famines wars and earthquakes shall have made great havoc in the world is it not highly probable that at the end of such a period pillars vases and statues now in being of granite or porphyry or jasper stones of such hardness as we know them to have lasted two thousand years above ground without any considerable alteration would bear record of these and past ages or that some of our current coins might then be dug up or old walls and the foundations of buildings show themselves as well as the shells and stones of the primaeval world are preserved down to our times to me it seems to follow from these considerations which common sense and experience make all men judges of that we may see good reason to conclude the world was created about the time recorded in holy scripture and if we admit a thing so extraordinary as the creation of this world it should seem that we admit something strange and odd and new to humane apprehension beyond any other miracle whatsoever  xxiv alciphron sat musing and made no answer whereupon lysicles expressed himself in the following manner i must own i should rather suppose with lucretius that the world was made by chance and that men grew out of the earth like pompions than pin my faith on those wretched fabulous fragments of oriental history and as for the learned men who have taken pains to illustrate and piece them together they appear to me no better than so many musty pedants an ingenious freethinker may perhaps now and then make some use of their lucubrations and play one absurdity against another but you are not therefore to think he pays any real regard to the authority of such apocryphal writers or believes one syllable of the chinese babylonian or egyptian traditions if we seem to give them a preference before the bible it is only because they are not established by law this is my plain sense of the matter and i dare say it is the general sense of our sect who are too rational to be in earnest on such trifles though they sometime give hints of deep erudition and put on a grave face to divert themselves with bigots alc since lysicles will have it so i am content not to build on accounts of time preceding the mosaic i must nevertheless beg leave to observe there is another point of a different nature against which there do not lie the same exceptions that deserves to be considered and may serve our purpose as well i presume it will be allowed that historians treating of times within the mosaic account ought by impartial men to be placed on the same foot with moses it may therefore be expected that those who pretend to vindicate his writings should reconcile them with parallel accounts of other authors treating of the same times things and persons and if we are not attached singly to moses but take our notions from other writers and the probability of things we shall see good cause to believe the jews were only a crew of leprous egyptians driven from their country on account of that loathsome distemper and that their religion pretended to have been delivered from heaven at mount sinai was in truth learned in egypt and brought from thence cri not to insist on what cannot be denied that an historian writing of his own times is to be believed before others who treat of the same subject several ages after it seems to me that it is absurd to expect we should reconcile moses with profane historians till you have first reconciled them one with another in answer therefore to what you observe i desire you would consider in the first place that manetho chaeremon and lysimachus had published inconsistent accounts of the jews and there going forth from egypt joseph contra apion l    in the second place that their language is a plain proof they were not of egyptian but either of phoenician of syrian or of chaldaean original and in the third place that it does not seem very probable to suppose their religion the basis or fundamental principle of which was the worship of one only supreme god and the principal design of which was to abolish idolatry could be derived from egypt the most idolatrous of all nations it must be owned the separate situation and institutions of the jews occasioned their being treated by some foreigners with great ignorance and contempt of them and their original but strabo who is allowed to have been a judicious and inquisitive writer though he was not acquainted with their true history makes more honorable mention of them he relates that moses with many other worshippers of one infinite god not approving the image worship of the egyptians and other nations went out from egypt and settled in jerusalem where they built a temple to one only god without images strab l      xxv alc we who assert the cause of liberty against religion in these later ages of the world lie under great disadvantages from the loss of ancient books which cleared up many points to the eyes of those great men celsus porphyry and julian which at a greater distance and with less help cannot so easily be made out by us but had we those records i doubt not we might demomolish the whole system at once cri and yet i make some doubt of this because those great men as you call them with all those advantages could not do it alc that must needs have been owing to the dullness and stupidity of the world in those days when the art of reasoning was not so much known and cultivated as of late but those men of true genius saw through the deceit themselves and were very clear in their opinion which convinces me they had good reason on their side cri and yet that great man celsus seems to have had very slight and inconstant notions one while he talks like a thorough epicurean another he admits miracles prophesies and a future state of rewards and punishments what think you alciphron is it not something capricious in so great a man among other advantages which he ascribes to brutes above humane kind to suppose they are magicians and prophets that they have a nearer commerce and union with the divinity that they know more than men and that elephants in particular are of all others most religious animals and strict observers of an oath origin contra celsum l    alc a great genius will be sometimes whimsical but what do you say to the emperor julian was not he an extraordinary man cri he seems by his writings to have been lively and satirical further i make no difficulty of owning that he was a generous temperate gallant and facetious emperor but at the same time it must be allowed because his own heathen panegyrist ammianus marcellinus am marcellin l    allows it that he was a prating light vain superstitious sort of man and therefore his judgment or authority can be but of small weight with those who are not prejudiced in his favor alc but of all the great men who wrote against revealed religion the greatest without question was that truly great man porphyry the loss of whose invaluable work can never be sufficiently lamented this profound philosopher went to the bottom and original of things he most learnedly confuted the scriptures showed the absurdity of the mosaic accounts undermined and exposed the prophesies and ridiculed allegorical interpretations luc holstenius de vita and scriptis porphyrii  the moderns it must be owned have done great things and shown themselves able men yet i cannot but regret the loss of what was done by a person of such vast abilities and who lived so much nearer the fountainhead though his authority survives his writings and must still have its weight with impartial men in spite of the enemies of truth cri porphyry i grant was a thorough infidel though he appears by no means to have been incredulous it seems he had a great opinion of wizards and necromancers and believed the mysteries miracles and prophesies of theurgists and egyptian priests he was far from being an enemy to obscure jargon and pretended to extraordinary ecstasies in a word this great man appears to have been as unintelligible as a schoolman as superstitious as a monk and as fanatical as any quietist or quaker and to complete his character as a minute philosopher he was under strong temptations to lay violent hands on himself we may frame a notion of this patriarch of infidelity by his judicious way of thinking upon other points as well as the christian religion so sagacious was he as to find out that the souls of insects when separated from their bodies become rational that demons of a thousand shapes assist in making philtrums and charms whose spiritual bodies are nourished and fattened by the steams of libations and sacrifices that the ghosts of those who died violent deaths use to haunt and appear about their sepulchers this same egregious philosopher advises a wise man not to eat flesh lest the impure soul of the brute that was put to violent death should enter along with the flesh into those who eat it he adds as a matter of fact confirmed by many experiments that those who would insinuate into themselves the souls of such animals as have the gift of foretelling things to come need only eat a principal part the heart for instance of a stag or a mole and so receive the soul of the animal which will prophesy in them like a god vide porphyrium de abstinentia de sacrificiis de diis and daemonibus  no wonder if men whose minds were preoccupied by faith and tenets of such a peculiar kind should be averse from the reception of the gospel upon the whole we desire to be excused if we do not pay the same deference to the judgment of men that appear to us whimsical superstitious weak and visionary which those impartial gentlemen do who admire their talents and are proud to tread in their footsteps alc men see things in different views what one admires another contemns it is even possible for a prejudiced mind whose attention is turned toward the faults and blemishes of things to fansy some shadow of defect in those great lights which in our own days have enlightened and still continue to enlighten the world  xxvi but pray tell me crito what you think of josephus he is allowed to have been a man of learning and judgment he was himself an asserter of revealed religion and christians when his authority serves their turn are used to cite him with respect cri all this i acknowledge alc must it not then seem very strange and very suspicious to every impartial inquirer that this learned jew writing the history of his own country of that very place and those very times where and when jesus christ made his appearance should yet say nothing of the character miracles and doctrine of that extraordinary person some ancient christians were so sensible of this that to make amends they inserted a famous passage in that historian which imposture has been sufficiently detected by able critics in the last age cri though there are not wanting able critics on the other side of the question yet not to enter upon the discussion of that celebrated passage i am content to give you all you can desire and suppose it not genuine but the pious fraud of some wrongheaded christian who could not brook the omission in josephus but this will never make such omission a real objection against christianity nor is there for ought i can see any thing in it whereon to ground either admiration or suspicion inasmuch as it should seem very natural supposing the gospel account exactly true for josephus to have said nothing of it considering that the view of that writer was to give his country some figure in the eye of the world which had been greatly prejudiced against the jews and knew little of their history to which end the life and death of our savior would not in any wise have conduced considering that josephus could not have been an eyewitness of our savior or his miracles considering that he was a pharisee of quality and learning foreign as well as jewish one of great employment in the state and that the gospel was preached to the poor that the first instruments of spreading it and the first converts to it were mean and illiterate that it might not seem the work of man or beholding to humane interest or power considering the general prejudice of the jews who expected in the messiah a temporal and conquering prince which prejudice was so strong that they chose rather to attribute our saviors miracles to the devil than acknowledge him to be the christ considering also the hellish disorder and confusion of the jewish state in the days of josephus when mens minds were filled and astonished with unparalled wars dissensions massacres and seditions of that devoted people laying all these things together i do not think it strange that such a man writing with such a view at such a time and in such circumstances should omit to describe our blessed saviors life and death or to mention his miracles or to take notice of the state of the christian church which was then as a grain of mustard seed beginning to take root and germinate and this will seem still less strange if it be considered that the apostles in a few years after our saviors death departed from jerusalem setting themselves to convert the gentiles and were dispersed throughout the world that the converts in jerusalem were not only of the meanest of the people but also few the three thousand added to the church in one day upon peters preaching in that city appearing to have been not inhabitants but strangers from all parts assembled to celebrate the feast of pentecost and that all the time of josephus and for several years after during a succession of fifteen bishops the christians at jerusalem observed the mosaic law sulp sever sacr hist l   and eusebius chron lib poster  and were consequently in outward appearance one people with the rest of the jews which must have made them less observable i would fain know what reason we have to suppose that the gospel which in its first propagation seemed to overlook the great or considerable men of this world might not also have been overlooked by them as a thing not suited to their apprehensions and way of thinking besides in those early times might not other learned jews as well as acts v gamaliel suspend their judgment of this new way as not knowing what to make or say of it being on one hand unable to quit the notions and traditions in which they were brought up and on the other not daring to resist or speak against the gospel lest they should be found to fight against god surely at all events it could never be expected that an unconverted jew should give the same account of the life miracles and doctrine of jesus christ as might become a christian to have given nor on the other hand was it at all improbable that a man of sense should beware to lessen or traduce what for ought he knew might have been a heavenly dispensation between which two courses the middle was to say nothing but pass it over in a doubtful or a respectful silence and it is observable that where this historian occasionally mentions jesus christ in his account of st jamess death he does it without any reflection or saying either good or bad though at the same time he shows a regard for the apostle it is observable i say that speaking of jesus his expression is who was called the christ not who pretended to be the christ or who was falsely called the christ but simply  jos ant l  0 c    it is evident josephus knew there was such a man as jesus and that he was said to be the christ and yet he condemns neither him nor his followers which to me seems an argument in their favor certainly if we suppose josephus to have known or been persuaded that he was an impostor it will be difficult to account for his not saying so in plain terms but if we suppose him in gamaliels way of thinking who suspended his judgment and was afraid of being found to fight against god it should seem natural for him to behave in that very manner which according to you makes against our faith but i verily think makes for it but what if josephus had been a bigot or even a sadducee an infidel an atheist what then we readily grant there might have been persons of rank politicians generals and men of letters then as well as now jews as well as englishmen who believed no revealed religion and that some such persons might possibly have heard of a man in low life who performed miracles by magic without informing themselves or perhaps ever inquiring about his mission and doctrine upon the whole i cannot comprehend why any man should conclude against the truth of the gospel from josephuss omitting to speak of it any more than from his omitting to embrace it had the first christians been chief priests and rulers or men of science and learning like philo and josephus it might perhaps with better color have been objected that their religion was of humane contrivance than now that it has pleased god by weak things to confound the strong this i think sufficiently accounts why in the beginning the gospel might overlook or be overlooked by men of a certain rank and character  xxvii alc and yet it seems an odd argument in proof of any doctrine that it was preached by simple people to simple people cri indeed if there was no other attestation to the truth of the christian religion this must be owned a very weak one but if a doctrine begun by instruments mean as to all humane advantages and making its first progress among those who had neither wealth nor art nor power to grace or encourage it should in a short time by it is own innate excellency the mighty force of miracles and the demonstration of the spirit not only without but against all worldly motives spread through the world and subdue men of all ranks and conditions of life would it not be very unreasonable to reject or suspect it for the want of humane means and might not this with much better reason be thought an argument of its coming from god alc but still an inquisitive man will want the testimony of men of learning and knowledge cri but from the first century onwards there was never wanting the testimony of such men who wrote learnedly in defense of the christian religion who lived many of them when the memory of things was fresh who had abilities to judge and means to know and who gave the clearest proofs of their conviction and sincerity alc but all the while these men were christians prejudiced christians and therefore their testimony is to be suspected cri it seems then you would have jews or heathens attest the truths of christianity alc that is the very thing i want cri but how can this be or if it could would not any rational man be apt to suspect such evidence and ask how it was possible for a man really to believe such things himself and not become a christian the apostles and first converts were themselves jews and brought up in a veneration for the law of moses and in all the prejudices of that people many fathers christian philosophers and learned apologists for the faith who had been bred gentiles were without doubt imbued with prejudices of education and if the finger of god and force of truth converted both the one and the other from judaism or gentilism in spite of their prejudices to christianity is not their testimony so much the stronger you have then the suffrages of both jews and gentiles attesting to the truth of our religion in the earliest ages but to expect or desire the attestation of jews remaining jews or of gentiles remaining gentiles seems unreasonable nor can it be imagined that the testimony of men who were not converted themselves should be the likeliest to convert others we have indeed the testimony of heathen writers to prove that about the time of our saviors birth there was a general expectation in the east of a messiah or prince who should found a new dominion that there were such people as christians that they were cruelly persecuted and put to death that they were innocent and holy in life and worship and that there did really exist in that time certain persons and facts mentioned in the new testament and for other points we have learned fathers several of whom had been as i already observed bred heathens to attest their truth alc for my part i have no great opinion of the capacity or learning of the fathers and many learned men especially of the reformed churches abroad are of the same mind which saves me the trouble of looking my self into their voluminous writings cri i shall not take upon me to say with the minute philosopher pomponatius lib de immortalitate animae  that origin basil augustine and diverse other fathers were equal to plato aristotle and the greatest of the gentiles in humane knowledge but if i may be allowed to make a judgment from what i have seen of their writings i should think several of them men of great parts eloquence and learning and much superior to these who seem to undervalue them without any affront to certain modern critics or translators erasmus may be allowed a man of fine taste and a fit judge of sense and good writing though his judgment in this point was very different from theirs some of our reformed brethern because the romanists attribute too much seem to have attributed too little to them from a very usual though no very judicious opposition which is apt to lead men to remark defects without making proper allowances and to say things which neither piety candor nor good sense require them to say  xxviii alc but though i should acknowledge that a concurring testimony of many learned and able men throughout the first ages of christianity may have its weight yet when i consider the great number of forgeries and heresies that sprung up in those times it very much weakens their credit cri pray alciphron would it be allowed a good argument in the mouth of a papist against the reformation that many absurd sects sprung up at the same time with it are we to wonder that when good seed is sowing the enemy should sow tares but at once to cut off several objections let us suppose in fact what you do not deny possible that there is a god a devil and a revelation from heaven committed to writing many centuries ago do but take a view of humane nature and consider what would probably follow upon such a supposition and whether it is not very likely there should be halfbelievers mistaken bigots holy frauds ambitious interested disputing conceited schismatical haeretical absurd men among the professors of such revealed religion as well as after a course of ages various readings omissions transpositions and obscurities in the text of the sacred oracles and if so i leave you to judge whether it be reasonable to make those events an objection against the being of a thing which would probably and naturally follow upon the supposal of its being alc after all say what you will this variety of opinions must needs shake the faith of a reasonable man where there are so many different opinions on the same point it is very certain they cannot all be true but it is certain they may all be false and the means to find out the truth when a man of sense sets about this inquiry he finds himself on a sudden startled and amused with hard words and knotty questions this makes him abandon the pursuit thinking the game not worth the chase cri but would not this man of sense do well to consider it must argue want of discernment to reject divine truths for the sake of humane follies use but the same candor and impartiality in treating of religion that you would think proper on other subjects we desire no more and expect no less in law in physic in politics wherever men have refined is it not evident they have been always apt to run into disputes and chicane but will that hinder you from admitting there are many good rules and just notions and useful truths in all those professions physicians may dispute perhaps vainly and unintelligibly about the animal system they may assign different causes of distempers some explaining them by the elementary qualities hot and cold moist and dry yet this does not hinder but the bark may be good for an ague and rhubarb for a flux nor can it others by chemical others by mechanical principles be inferred from the different sects which from time to time have sprung up in that profession the dogmatic for instance empiric methodic galenic paracelsian or the hard words and knotty questions and idle theories which have grown from them or been engrafted on them that therefore we should deny the circulation of the blood or reject their excellent rules about exercise air and diet alc it seems you would screen religion by the example of other professions all which have produced sects and disputes as well as christianity which may in itself be true and useful notwithstanding many false and fruitless notions engrafted on it by the wit of man certainly if this had been observed or believed by many acute reasoners they would never have made the multiplicity of religious opinions and controversies an argument against religion in general cri how such an obvious truth should escape men of sense and inquiry i leave you to account but i can very easily account for gross mistakes in those who pass for freethinkers without ever thinking or if if they do think whose meditations are employed on other points of a very different nature from a serious and impartial inquiry about religion  xxix but to return what or where is the profession of men who never split into schisms or never talk nonsense is it not evident that out of all the kinds of knowledge on which the humane mind is employed there grow certain excrescences which may be pared off like the clippings of hair or nails in the body and with no worse consequence whatever bigots or enthusiasts whatever notional or scholastic divines may say or think it is certain the faith derived from christ and his apostles was not a piece of empty sophistry they did not deliver and transmit down to us  but  to use the expression of a holy confessor socr histor eccles l    and to pretend to demolish their foundation for the sake of humane superstructure be it hay or stubble or what it will is no argument of just thought or reason any more than it is of fairness to suppose a doubtful sense fixed and argue from one side of the question in disputed points whether for instance the beginning of genesis is to be understood in a literal or allegorical sense whether the book of job be an history or a parable being points disputed between christians an infidel can have no right to argue from one side of the question in those or the like cases this or that tenet of a sect this or that contraverted notion is not what we contend for at present but the general faith taught by christ and his apostles and preserved by universal and perpetual tradition in all the churches down to our own times to tax or strike at this divine doctrine on account of things foreign and adventitious the speculations and disputes of curious men is in my mind an absurdity of the same kind as it would be to cut down a fine tree yielding fruit and shade because its leaves afforded nourishment to caterpillars or because spiders may now and then weave cobwebs among the branches alc to divide and distinguish would take time we have several gentlemen very capable of judging in the gross but that want of attention for irksome and dry studies or minute inquiries to which as it would be very hard to oblige men against their will so it must be a great wrong to the world as well as themselves to debar them from the right of deciding according to their natural sense of things cri it were to be wished those capable men would employ their judgment and attention on the same objects if theological inquiries are unpalatable the field of nature is wide how many discoveries to be made how many errors to be corrected in arts and sciences how many vices to be reformed in life and manners why do men single out such points as are innocent and useful when there are so many pernicious mistakes to be amended why set themselves to destroy the hopes of humane kind and encouragements to virtue why delight to judge where they disdain to inquire why not employ their noble talents on the longitude or perpetual motion alc i wonder you should not see the difference between points of curiosity and religion those employ only men of a genius or humor suited to them but all mankind have a right to censure and are concerned to judge of these except they will blindly submit to be governed by the stale wisdom of their ancestors and the established laws of their country cri it should seem if they are concerned to judge they are not less concerned to examine before they judge alc but after all the examination and inquiry that mortal man can make about revealed religion it is impossible to come at any rational sure footing  xxx there is indeed a deal of specious talk about faith founded upon miracles but when i examine this matter thoroughly and trace christian faith up to its original i find it rests upon much darkness and scruple and uncertainty instead of points evident or agreeable to humane reason i find a wonderful narrative of the son of god tempted in the wilderness by the devil a thing utterly unaccountable without any end or use or reason whatsoever i meet with strange histories of apparitions of angels and voices from heaven with surprising accounts of daemoniacs things quite out of the road of common sense or observation with several incredible feats said to have been done by divine power but more probably the inventions of men nor the less likely to be so because i cannot pretend to say with what view they were invented disigns deeply laid are dark and the less we know the more we suspect but admitting them for true i shall not allow them to be miraculous until i thoroughly know the power of what are called second causes and the force of magic cri you seem alciphron to analyze not faith but infidelity and trace it to its principles which from your own account i collect to be dark and doubtful scruples and surmises hastiness in judging and narrowness in thinking grounded on a fanciful notion which overrates the little scantling of your own experience and on real ignorance of the views of providence and of the qualities operations and mutual respects of the several kinds of beings which are or may be for ought you know in the universe thus obscure uncertain conceited and conjectural are the principles of infidelity whereas on the other hand the principles of faith seem to be points plain and clear it is a clear point that this faith in christ was spread abroad throughout the world soon after his death it is a clear point that this was not effected by humane learning politics or power it is a clear point that in the early times of the church there were several men of knowledge and integrity who embraced this faith not from any but against all temporal motives it is a clear point that the nearer they were to the fountainhead the more opportunity they had to satisfy themselves as to the truth of these facts which they believed it is a clear point that the less interest there was to persuade the more need there was of evidence to convince them it is a clear point that they relied on the authority of those who declared themselves eyewitnesses of the miracles and resurrection of christ it is a clear point that those professed eyewitnesses suffered much for this their attestation and finally sealed it with their blood it is a clear point that these witnesses weak and contemptible as they were overcame the world spread more light preached purer morals and did more benefit to mankind than all the philosophers and sages put together these points appear to me clear and sure and being allowed such they are plain just and reasonable motives of assent they stand upon no fallacious ground they contain nothing beyond our sphere neither supposing more knowledge nor other faculties than we are really masters of and if they should not be admitted for morally certain as i believe they will by fair and unprejudiced inquirers yet the allowing them to be only probable is sufficient to stop the mouth of an infidel these plain points i say are the pillars of our faith and not those obscure ones by you supposed which are in truth the unsound uncertain principles of infidelity to a rash prejudiced and assuming spirit to raise an argument or answer an objection from hidden powers of nature or magic is groping in the dark but by the evident light of sense men might be sufficiently certified of sensible effects and matters of fact such as the miracles and resurrection of christ and the testimony of such men may be transmitted to afterages with the same moral certainty as other historical narrations and those same miraculous facts compared by reason with the doctrines they were brought to prove do afford to an unbiassed mind strong indications of their coming from god or a superior principle whose goodness retrieved the moral world whose power commanded the natural and whose providence extended over both give me leave to say that nothing dark nothing incomprehensible or mysterious or unaccountable is the ground or motive the principle or foundation the proof or reason of our faith although it may be the object of it for it must be owned that if by clear and sure principles we are rationally led to believe a point less clear we do not therefore reject such point because it is mysterious to conceive or difficult to account for nor would it be right so to do as for jews and gentiles anciently attributing our saviors miracles to magic this is so far from being a proof against them that to me it seems rather a proof of the facts without disproving the cause to which we ascribe them as we do not pretend to know the nature and operations of demons the history laws and system of rational beings and the schemes or views of providence so far as to account for every action and appearance recorded in the gospel so neither do you know enough of those things to be able from that knowledge of yours to object against accounts so well attested it is an easy matter to raise scruples upon many authentic parts of civil history which requiring a more perfect knowledge of facts circumstances and councils than we can come at to explain them must be to us inexplicable and this is still more easy with respect to the history of nature in which if surmises were admitted for proofs against things odd strange and unaccountable if our scanty experience were made the rule and measure of truth and all those phenomenon rejected that we through ignorance of the principles and laws and system of nature could not explain we should indeed make discoveries but it would be only of our own blindness and presumption and why men that are so easily and so often gravelled in common points in things natural and visible should yet be so sharpsighted and dogmatical about the invisible world and its mysteries is to me a point utterly unaccountable by all the rules of logic and good sense upon the whole therefore i cannot help thinking there are points sufficiently plain and clear and full whereon a man may ground a reasonable faith in christ but that the attacks of minute philosophers against this faith are grounded upon darkness ignorance and presumption alc i doubt i shall still remain in the dark as to the proofs of the christian religion and always presume there is nothing in them  xxxi for how is it possible at this remote distance to arrive at any knowledge or frame any demonstration about it cri what then knowledge i grant in a strict sense cannot be had without evidence or demonstration but probable arguments are a sufficient ground of faith who ever supposed that scientifical proofs were necessary to make a christian faith alone is required and provided that in the main and upon the whole men are persuaded this saving faith may consist with some degrees of obscurity scruple and error for although the light of truth be unchangeable and the same in its eternal source the father of lights yet with respect to us it is variously weakened and obscured by passing through a long distance or gross medium where it is intercepted distorted or tinctured by the prejudices and passions of men but all this notwithstanding he that will use his eyes may see enough for the purposes either of nature or of grace though by a light dimmer indeed or clearer according to the place or the distance or the hour or the medium and it will be sufficient if such analogy appears between the dispensations of grace and nature as may make it probable although much should be unaccountable in both to suppose them derived from the same author and the workmanship of one and the same hand alc those who saw and touched and handled jesus christ after his resurrection if there were any such may be said to have seen by a clear light but to us the light is very dim and yet it is expected we should believe this point as well as they for my part i believe with spinosa that christs death was literal but his resurrection allegorical v spinosae epist ad oldenburgium  cri and for my part i can see nothing in this celebrated infidel that should make me desert matters of fact and moral evidence to adopt his notions though i must needs own i admit an allegorical resurrection that proves the real to wit a resurrection of christs disciples from weakness to resolution from fear to courage from despair to hope of which for ought i can see no rational account can be given but the sensible evidence that our lord was truly really and literally risen from the dead but as it cannot be denied that his disciples who were eyewitnesses of his miracles and resurrection had stronger evidence than we can have of those points so it cannot be denied that such evidence was then more necessary to induce men to embrace a new institution contrary to the whole system of their education their prejudices their passions their interests and every humane motive though to me it seems the moral evidence and probable arguments within our reach are abundantly sufficient to make prudent thinking men adhere to the faith handed down to us from our ancestors established by the laws of our country requiring submission in points above our knowledge and for the rest recommending doctrines the most agreeable to our interest and our reason and however strong the light might have been at the fountainhead yet its long continuance and propagation by such unpromising instruments throughout the world have been very wonderful we may now take a more comprehensive view of the connection order and progress of the divine dispensations and by a retrospect on a long series of past ages perceive a unity of design running throughout the whole a gradual disclosing and fulfilling the purposes of providence a regular progress from types to antitypes from things carnal to things spiritual from earth to heaven we may behold christ crucified that stumbling block to the jews and foolishness to the greeks putting a final period to the temple worship of the one and the idolatry of the other and that stone which was cut out of the mountain without hands and brake in pieces all other kingdoms become it self a great mountain  xxxii if a due reflection on these things be not sufficient to beget a reverence for the christian faith in the minds of men i should rather impute it to any other cause than a wise and cautious incredulity when i see their easiness of faith in the common concerns of life where there is no prejudice or appetite to bias or disturb their natural judgment when i see those very men that in religion will not stir a step without evidence and at every turn exspect demonstration trust their health to a physician and their lives to a sailor with an implicit faith i cannot think they deserve the honor of being thought more incredulous than other men or that they are more accustomed to know and for this reason less inclined to believe on the contrary one is tempted to suspect that ignorance has a greater share than science in our modern infidelity and that it proceeds more from a wrong head or an irregular will than from deep researches lys we do not it must be owned think that learning or deep researches are necessary to pass right judgments upon things i sometimes suspect that learning is apt to produce and justify whims and sincerely believe we should do better without it our sect are divided on this point but much the greater part think with me i have heard more than once very observing men remark that learning was the true humane means which preserved religion in the world and that if we had it in our power to prefer blockheads in the church all would soon be right cri men must be strangely in love with their opinions to put out their eyes rather than part with them but it has been often remarked by observing men that there are no greater bigots than infidels lys what a freethinker and a bigot impossible cri not so impossible neither that an infidel should be bigoted to his infidelity methinks i see a bigot wherever i see a man overbearing and positive without knowing why laying the greatest stress on points of smallest moment hasty to judge of the conscience thoughts and inward views of other men impatient of reasoning against his own opinions and choosing them with inclination rather than judgment an enemy to learning and attached to mean authorities how far our modern infidels agree with this description i leave to be considered by those who really consider and think for themselves lys we are no bigots we are men that discover difficulties in religion that tie knots and raise scruples which disturb the repose and interrupt the golden dreams of bigots who therefore cannot endure us cri they who cast about for difficulties will be sure to find or make them upon every subject but he that would upon the foot of reason erect himself into a judge in order to make a wise judgment on a subject of that nature will not only consider the doubtful and difficult parts of it but take a comprehensive view of the whole consider it in all its parts and relations trace it to its original examine its principles effects and tendencies its proofs internal and external he will distinguish between the clear points and the obscure the certain and the uncertain the essential and circumstantial between what is genuine and what foreign he will consider the different sorts of proof that belong to different things where evidence is to be expected where probability may suffice and where it is reasonable to suppose there should be doubts and scruples he will proportion his pains and exactness to the importance of the inquiry and check that disposition of his mind to conclude all those notions groundless prejudices with which it was imbued before it knew the reason of them he will silence his passions and listen to truth he will endeavor to untie knots as well as to tie them and dwell rather on the light parts of things than the obscure he will balance the force of his understanding with the difficulty of the subject and to render his judgment impartial hear evidence on all sides and so far as he is led by authority choose to follow that of the honestest and wisest men now it is my sincere opinion the christian religion may well stand the test of such an inquiry lys but such an inquiry would cost too much pains and time we have thought of another method the bringing religion to the test of wit and humor this we find a much shorter easier and more effectual way and as all enemies are at liberty to choose their weapons we make choice of those we are most expert at and we are the better pleased with this choice having observed that of all things a solid divine hates a jest to consider the whole of the subject to read and think on all sides to object plainly and answer directly upon the foot of dry reason and argument would be a very tedious and troublesome affair besides it is attacking pedants at their own weapons how much more delicate and artful is it to give a hint to cover ones self with an aenigma to drop a double entendre to keep it in ones power to recover and slip aside and leave his antagonist beating the air this has been practiced with great success and i believe it the top method to gain proselytes and confound pedants cri i have seen several things written in this way which i suppose were copied from the behavior of a sly sort of scorners one may sometimes meet with suppose a conceited man that would pass for witty tipping the wink upon one thrusting out his tongue at another one while waggishly smiling another with a grave mouth and ludicrous eyes often affecting the countenance of one who smothered a jest and sometimes bursting out in a horselaugh what a figure would this be i will not say in the senate or council but in a private visit among wellbred men and yet this is the figure that certain great authors who in this age would pass for models and do pass for models make in their polite and elaborate writings on the most weighty points alc i who profess my self an admirer an adorer of reason am obliged to own that in some cases the sharpness of ridicule can do more than the strength of argument but if we exert our selves in the use of mirth and humor it is not for want of other weapons it shall never be said that a freethinker was afraid of reasoning no crito we have reasons in store the best are yet to come and if we can find an hour for another conference before we set out to morrow morning i will undertake you shall be plied with reasons as clear and home and close to the point as you could wish  the seventh dialogue i christian faith impossible ii words stand for ideas iii no knowledge or

out for london next morning we assembled at break of day in the library alciphron began with a declaration of his sincerity assuring us he had very maturely and with a most unbiassed mind considered all that had been said the day before he added that upon the whole he could not deny several probable reasons were produced for embracing the christian faith but said he those reasons being only probable can never prevail against absolute certainty and demonstration if therefore i can demonstrate your religion to be a thing altogether absurd and inconsistent your probable arguments in its defense do from that moment lose their force and with it all right to be answered or considered the concurring testimony of sincere and able witnesses has without question great weight in humane affairs i will even grant that things odd and unaccountable to humane judgment or experience may sometimes claim our assent on that sole motive and i will also grant it possible for a tradition to be conveyed with moral evidence through many centuries but at the same time you will grant to me that a thing demonstrably and palpably false is not to be admitted on any testimony whatever which at best can never amount to demonstration to be plain no testimony can make nonsense sense no moral evidence can make contradictions consistent know then that as the strength of our cause does not depend upon so neither is it to be decided by any critical points of history chronology or languages you are not to wonder if the same sort of tradition and moral proof which governs our assent with respect to facts in civil or natural history is not admitted as a sufficient voucher for metaphysical absurdities and absolute impossibilities things obscure and unaccountable in humane affairs or the operations of nature may yet be possible and if well attested may be assented unto but religious assent or faith can be evidently shown in its own nature to be impracticable impossible and absurd this is the primary motive to infidelity this is our citadel and fortress which may indeed be graced with outworks of various erudition but if those are demolished remains in it self and of its own proper strength impregnable euph this it must be owned reduces our inquiry within a narrow compass do but make out this and i shall have nothing more to say alc know then that the shallow mind of the vulgar as it dwells only on the outward surface of things and considers them in the gross may be easily imposed on hence a blind reverence for religious faith and mystery but when an acute philosopher comes to dissect and analyze these points the imposture plainly appears and as he has no blindness so he has no reverence for empty notions or to speak more properly for mere forms of speech which mean nothing and are of no use to mankind  ii words are signs they do or should stand for ideas which so far as they suggest they are significant but words that suggest no ideas are insignificant he who annexeth a clear idea to every word he makes use of speaks sense but where such ideas are wanting the speaker utters nonsense in order therefore to know whether any mans speech be senseless and insignificant we have nothing to do but lay aside the words and consider the ideas suggested by them men not being able immediately to communicate their ideas one to another are obliged to make use of sensible signs or words the use of which is to raise those ideas in the hearer which are in the mind of the speaker and if they fail of this end they serve to no purpose he who really thinks has a train of ideas succeeding each other and connected in his mind and when he expresses himself by discourse each word suggests a distinct idea to the hearer or reader who by that means has the same train of ideas in his which was in the mind of the speaker or writer as far as this effect is produced so far the discourse is intelligible has sense and meaning hence it follows that whoever can be supposed to understand what he reads or hears must have a train of ideas raised in his mind correspondent to the train of words read or heard these plain truths to which men readily assent in theory are but little attended to in practice and therefore deserve to be enlarged on and inculcated however obvious and undeniable mankind are generally averse from thinking though apt enought to entertain discourse either in themselves or others the effect whereof is that their minds are rather stored with names than ideas the husk of science rather than the thing and yet these words without meaning do often make distinctions of parties the subject matter of their disputes and the object of their zeal this is the most general cause of error which does not influence ordinary minds alone but even those who pass for acute and learned philosophers are often employed about names instead of things or ideas and are supposed to know when they only pronounce hard words without a meaning  iii though it is evident that as knowledge is the perception of the connection or disagreement between ideas he who does not distinctly perceive the ideas marked by the terms so as to form a mental proposition answering to the verbal cannot possibly have knowledge no more can he be said to have opinion or faith which imply a weaker assent but still it must be to a proposition the terms of which are understood as clearly although the agreement or disagreement of the ideas may not be so evident as in the case of knowledge i say all degrees of assent whether founded on reason or authority more or less cogent are internal acts of the mind which alike terminate in ideas as their proper object without which there can be really no such thing as knowledge faith or opinion we may perhaps raise a dust and dispute about tenets purely verbal but what is this at bottom more than mere trifling all which will be easily admitted with respect to humane learning and science wherein it is an allowed method to expose any doctrine or tenet by stripping them of the words and examining what ideas are underneath or whether any ideas at all this is often found the shortest way to end disputes which might otherwise grow and multiply without end the litigants neither understanding one another nor themselves it were needless to illustrate what shines by its own light and is admitted by all thinking men my endeavor shall be only to apply it in the present case i suppose i need not be at any pains to prove that the same rules of reason and good sense which obtain in all other subjects ought to take place in religion as for those who consider faith and reason as two distinct provinces and would have us think good sense has nothing to do where it is most concerned i am resolved never to argue with such men but leave them in quiet possession of their prejudices and now for the particular application of what i have said i shall not single out any nice disputed points of school divinity or those that relate to the nature and essence of god which being allowed infinite you might pretend to screen them under the general notion of difficulties attending the nature of infinity  iv grace is the main point in the christian dispensation nothing is oftener mentioned or more considered throughout the new testament wherein it is represented as somewhat of a very particular kind distinct from any thing revealed to the jews or known by the light of nature this same grace is spoken of as the gift of god as coming by jesus christ as reigning as abounding as operating men are said to speak through grace to believe through grace mention is made of the glory of grace the riches of grace the stewards of grace christians are said to be heirs of grace to receive grace grow in grace be strong in grace to stand in grace and to fall from grace and lastly grace is said to justify and to save them hence christianity is styled the covenant of dispensation of grace and it is well known that no point has created more controversy in the church than this doctrine of grace what disputes about its nature extent and effects about universal efficacious sufficient preventing irrisistible grace have employed the pens of protestant as well as popish divines of jansenists and molinists of lutherans calvinists and arminians as i have not the least curiosity to know so i need not say it suffices to observe that there have been and are still subsisting great contests upon these points only one thing i should desire to be informed of to wit what is the clear and distinct idea marked by the word grace i presume a man may know the bare meaning of a term without going into the depth of all those learned inquiries this surely is an easy matter provided there is an idea annexed to such term and if there is not it can be neither the subject of a rational dispute nor the object of real faith men may indeed impose upon themselves or others and pretend to argue and believe when at bottom there is no argument or belief farther than mere verbal trifling grace taken in the vulgar sense either for beauty or favor i can easily understand but when it denotes an active vital ruling principle influencing and operating on the mind of man distinct from every natural power or motive i profess my self altogether unable to understand it or frame any distinct idea of it and therefore i cannot assent to any proposition concerning it nor consequently have any faith about it and it is a self evident truth that god obliges no man to impossibilities at the request of a philosophical friend i did cast an eye on the writings he showed me of some divines and talked with others on this subject but after all i had read or heard could make nothing of it having always found whenever i laid aside the word grace and looked into my own mind a perfect vacuity or privation of all ideas and as i am apt to think mens minds and faculties are made much alike i suspect that other men if they examined what they call grace with the same exactness and indifference would agree with me that there was nothing in it but an empty name this is not the only instance where a word often heard and pronounced is believed intelligible for no other reason but because it is familiar of the same kind are many other points reputed necessary articles of faith that which in the present case imposes upon mankind i take to be partly this men speak of this holy principle as of something that acts moves and determines taking their ideas from corporeal things from motion and the force or momentum of bodies which being of an obvious and sensible nature they substitute in place of a thing spiritual and incomprehensible which is a manifest delusion for though the idea of corporeal force be never so clear and intelligible it will not therefore follow that the idea of grace a thing perfectly incorporeal must be so too and though we may reason distinctly perceive assent and form opinions about the one it will by no means follow that we can do so of the other thus it comes to pass that a clear sensible idea of what is real produces or rather is made a pretense for an imaginary spiritual faith that terminates in no object a thing impossible for there can be no assent where there are no ideas and where there is no assent there can be no faith and what cannot be that no man is obliged to this is as clear as any thing in euclid  v the same method of reasoning may be applied by any man of sense to consute all other the most essential articles of the christian faith you are not therefore to wonder that a man who proceeds on such solid grounds such clear and evident principles should be deaf to all you can say from moral evidence or probable arguments which are nothing in the balance against demonstration euph the more light and force there is in this discourse the more you are to blame for not having produced it sooner for my part i should never have said one word against evidence but let me see whether i understand you rightly you say every word in an intelligible discourse must stand for an idea which ideas as far as they are clearly and distinctly apprehended so far the discourse has meaning without which it is useless and insignificant alc i do euph for instance when i hear the words man triangle color pronounced they must excite in my mind distinct ideas of those things whereof they are signs otherwise i cannot be said to understand them alc right euph and this is the only true use of language alc that is what i affirm euph but every time the word man occurs in reading or conversation i am not conscious that the particular distinct idea of a man is excited in my mind for instance when i read in st pauls epistle to the galatians these words if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing he deceives himself methinks i comprehend the force and meaning of this proposition although i do not frame to my self the particular distinst idea of a man alc it is very true you do not form in your mind the particular idea of peter james or john of a fair or a black a tall or a low a fat or a lean a straight or a crooked a wise or a foolish a sleeping or waking man but the abstract general idea of man prescinding from and exclusive of all particular shape size complexion passions faculties and every individual circumstance to explain this matter more fully you are to understand there is in the humane mind a faculty of contemplating the general nature of things separate from all those particularities which distinguish the individuals one from another for example in peter james and john you may observe in each a certain collection of stature figure color and other peculiar properties by which they are known asunder distinguished from all other men and if i may so say individuated now leaving out of the idea of a man that which is peculiar to the individual and retaining only that which is common to all men you form an abstract universal idea of man or humane nature which includes no particular stature shape color or other quality whether of mind or body after the same manner you may observe particular triangles to differ one from another as their sides are equal or unequal and their angles greater or lesser whence they are denominated aequilateral aequicrural or scalenum obtusangular acutangular or rectangular but the mind excluding out of its idea all these peculiar properties and distinctions frames the general abstract idea of a triangle which is neither aequilateral aequicrural nor scalenum neither obtusangular acutangular nor rectangular but all and none of these at once see lock on humane understanding b   c    the same may be said of the general abstract idea of color which is something distinct from and exclusive of blue red green yellow and every other particular color including only that general essence in which they all agree and what has been said of these three general names and the abstract general ideas they stand for may be applied to all others for you must know that particular things or ideas being infinite if each were marked or signified by a distinct proper name words must have been innumerable and language an endless impossible thing hence it comes to pass that appellative or general names stand immediately and properly not for particular but for abstract general ideas which they never fail to excite in the mind as often as they are used to any significant purpose and without this there could be no communication or enlargement of knowledge no such thing as universal science or theorems of any kind now for understanding any proposition or discourse it is sufficient that distinct ideas are thereby raised in your mind correspondent to those in the speakers whether the ideas so raised are particular or only abstract and general ideas forasmuch nevertheless as these are not so obvious and familiar to vulgar minds it happens that some men may think they have no idea at all when they have not a particular idea but the truth is you had the abstract general idea of man in the instance assigned wherein you thought you had none after the same manner when it is said that the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right ones or that color is the object of sight it is evident the words do not stand for this or that triangle or color but for abstract general ideas excluding every thing peculiar to the individuals and including only the universal nature common to the whole kind of triangles or of colors  vi euph tell me alciphron are those abstract general ideas clear and distinct alc they are above all others clear and distinct being the only proper object of science which is altogether conversant about universals euph and do you not think it very possible for any man to know whether he has this or that clear and distinct idea or no alc doubtless to know this he needs only examine his own thoughts and look into his own mind euph but upon looking into my own mind i do not find that i have or can have these general abstract ideas of a man or a triangle abovementioned or of color prescinded from all particular colors see the introduction to a treatise concerning the principles of humane knowledge printed in the year mdccx where the absurdity of abstract ideas is fully considered  though i shut mine eyes and use mine utmost efforts and reflect on all that passes in my own mind i find it utterly impossible to form such ideas alc to reflect with due attention and turn the mind inward upon it self is a difficult task and not every ones talent euph not to insist on what you allowed that every one might easily know for himself whether he has this or that idea or no i am tempted to think no body else can form those ideas any more than i can pray alciphron which are those things you would call absolutely impossible alc such as include a contradiction euph can you frame an idea of what includes a contradiction alc i cannot euph consequently whatever is absolutely impossible you cannot form an idea of alc this i grant euph but can a color or triangle such as you describe their abstract general ideas really exist alc it is absolutely impossible such things should exist in nature euph should it not follow then that they cannot exist in your mind or in other words that you cannot conceive or frame an idea of them alc you seem euphranor not to distinguish between pure intellect and imagination abstract general ideas i take to be the object of pure intellect which may conceive them although they cannot perhaps be imagined euph i do not perceive that i can by any faculty whether of intellect or imagination conceive or frame an idea of that which is impossible and includes a contradiction and i am very much at a loss to account for your admitting that in common instances which you would make an argument against divine faith and mysteries  vii alc there must be some mistake in this how is it possible there should be general knowledge without general propositions or these without general names which cannot be without general ideas by standing for which they become general euph but may not words become general by being made to stand indiscriminately for all particular ideas which from a mutual resemblance belong to the same kind without the intervention of any abstract general idea alc is there then no such thing as a general idea euph may we not admit general ideas though we should not admit them to be made by abstraction or though we should not allow of general abstract ideas to me it seems a particular idea may become general by being used to stand for or represent other ideas and that general knowledge is conversant about signs or general ideas made such by their signification and which are considered rather in their relative capacity and as substituted for others than in their own nature or for their own sake a black line for instance an inch long though in it self particular may yet become universal being used as a sign to stand for any line whatsoever alc it is your opinion then that words become general by representing an indefinite number of particular ideas euph it seems so to me alc whenever therefore i hear a general name it must be supposed to excite some one or other particular idea of that species in my mind euph i cannot say so neither pray alciphron does it seem to you necessary that as often as the word man occurs in reading or discourse you must form in your mind the idea of a particular man alc i own it does not and not finding particular ideas always suggested by the words i was led to think i had abstract general ideas suggested by them and this is the opinion of all thinking men who are agreed the only use of words is to suggest ideas and indeed what other use can we assign them  viii euph be the use of words or names what it will i can never think it is to do things impossible let us then inquire what it is and see if we can make sense of our daily practice words it is agreed are signs it may not therefore be amiss to examine the use of other signs in order to know that of words counters for instance at a cardtable are used not for their own sake but only as signs substituted for money as words are for ideas say now alciphron is it necessary every time these counters are used throughout the whole progress of a game to frame an idea of the distinct sum or value that each represents alc by no means it is sufficient the players at first agree on their respective values and at last substitute those values in their stead euph and in casting up a sum where the figures stand for pounds shillings and pence do you think it necessary throughout the whole progress of the operation in each step to form ideas of pounds shillings and pence alc i do not it will suffice if in the conclusion those figures direct our actions with respect to things euph from hence it seems to follow that words may not be insignificant although they should not every time they are used excite the ideas they signify in our minds it being sufficient that we have it in our power to substitute things or ideas for their signs when there is occasion it seems also to follow that there may be another use of words besides that of marking and suggesting distinct ideas to wit the influencing our conduct and actions which may be done either by forming rules for us to act by or by raising certain passions dispositions and emotions in our minds a discourse therefore that directs how to act or excites to the doing or forbearance of an action may it seems be useful and significant although the words whereof it is composed should not bring each a distinct idea into our minds alc it seems so euph pray tell me alciphron is not an idea altogether inactive alc it is euph an agent therefore an active mind or spirit cannot be an idea or like an idea whence it should seem to follow that those words which denote an active principle soul or spirit do not in a strict and proper sense stand for ideas and yet they are not insignificant neither since i understand what is signified by the term i or my self or know what it means although it be no idea nor like an idea but that which thinks and wills and apprehends ideas and operates about them alc what would you infer from this euph what has been inferred already that words may be significant although they do not stand for ideas see the principles of humane knowledge sect     and the introduction sect  0  the contrary whereof having been presumed seems to have produced the doctrine of abstract ideas alc will you not allow then that the mind can abstract euph i do not deny it may abstract in a certain sense inasmuch as those things that can really exist or be really perceived asunder may be conceived asunder or abstracted one from the other for instance a mans head from his body color from motion figure from weight but it will not thence follow that the mind can frame abstract general ideas which appear to be impossible alc and yet it is a current opinion that every substantive name marks out and exhibits to the mind one distinct idea separate from all others euph pray alciphron is not the word number such a substantive name alc it is euph do but try now whether you can frame an idea of number in abstract exclusive of all signs words and things numbered i profess for my own part i cannot alc can it be so hard a matter to form a simple idea of number the object of a most evident demonstrable science hold let me see if i cannot abstract the idea of number from the numeral names and characters and all particular numerable things upon which alciphron paused a while and then said to confess the truth i do not find that i can euph but though it seems neither you nor i can form distinct simple ideas of number we can nevertheless make a very proper and significant use of numeral names they direct us in the disposition and management of our affairs and are of such necessary use that we should not know how to do without them and yet if other mens faculties may be judged of by mine to attain a precise simple abstract idea of number is as difficult as to comprehend any mystery in religion  ix but to come to your own instance let us examine what idea we can frame of force abstracted from body motion and outward sensible effects for my self i do not find that i have or can have any such idea alc surely every one knows what is meant by force euph and yet i question whether every one can form a distinct idea of force let me entreat you alciphron be not amused by terms lay aside the word force and exclude every other thing from your thoughts and then see what precise idea you have of force alc force is that in bodies which produces motion and other sensible effects euph it is then something distinct from those effects alc it is euph be pleased now to exclude the consideration of its subject and effects and contemplate force it self in its own precise idea alc i profess i find it no such easy matter euph take your own advice and shut your eyes to assist your meditation upon this alciphron having closed his eyes and mused a few minutes declared he could make nothing of it and that replied euphranor which it seems neither you nor i can frame an idea of by your own remark of mens minds and faculties being made much alike we may suppose others have no more an idea of than we alc we may euph but notwithstanding all this it is certain there are many speculations reasonings and disputes refined subtilties and nice distinctions about this same force and to explain its nature and distinguish the several notions or kinds of it the terms gravity reaction vis inertiae vis insita vis impressa vis mortua vis viva impetus momentum solicitatio conatus and diverse other such like expressions have been used by learned men and no small controversies have arisen about the notions or definitions of these terms it had puzzled men to know whether force is spiritual or corporeal whether it remains after action how it is transferred from one body to another strange paradoxes have been framed about its nature properties and proportions for instance that contrary forces may at once subsist in the same quiescent body that the force of percussion in a small particle is infinite for which and other curiosities of the same sort you may consult berellus de vi percussionis the lezioni academiche of toricelli the exercitations of hermanus and other writers it is well known to the learned world what a controversy has been carried on between mathematicians particularly monsieur leibnitz and monsieur papin in the leipsic acta eruditorum about the proportion of forces whether they be each to other in a proportion compounded of the simple proportions of the bodies and the celerities or in one compounded of the simple proportion of the bodies and the duplicate proportion of the celerities a point it seems not yet agreed as indeed the reality of the thing it self is made a question leibnitz distinguishes between the nisus elementaris and the impetus which is formed by a repetition of the nisus elementaris and seems to think they do not exist in nature but are made only by an abstraction of the mind the same author treating of original active force to illustrate his subject has recourse to the substantial forms and entelecheia of aristotle and the ingenious toricelli says of force and impetus that they are subtle abstracts and spiritual quintessences and concerning the momentum and the velocity of heavy bodies falling he says they are un certo che and un non so che that is in plain english he knows not what to make of them upon the whole therefore may we not pronounce that excluding body time space motion and all its sensible measures and effects we shall find it as difficult to form an idea of force as of grace alc i do not know what to think of it  x euph and yet i presume you allow there are very evident propositions or theorems relating to force which contain useful truths for instance that a body with conjunct forces describes the diagonal of a parallelogram in the same time that it would the sides with separate is not this a principle of very extensive use does not the doctrine of the composition and resolution of forces depend upon it and in consequence thereof numberless rules and theorems directing men how to act and explaining phenomenon throughout the mechanics and mathematical philosophy and if by considering this doctrine of force men arrive at the knowledge of many inventions in mechanics and are taught to frame engines by means of which things difficult and otherwise impossible may be performed and if the same doctrine which is so beneficial here below serves also as a key to discover the nature of the celestial motions shall we deny that it is of use either in practice or speculation because we have no distinct idea of force or that which we admit with regard to force upon what pretense can we deny concerning grace if there are queries disputes perplexities diversity of notions and opinions about the one so there are about the other also if we can form no precise distinct idea of the one so neither can we of the other ought we not therefore by a parity of reason to conclude there may be diverse true and useful propositions concerning the one as well as the other and that grace may be an object of our faith and influence our life and actions as a principle destructive of evil habits and productive of good ones although we cannot attain a distinct idea of it separate or abstracted from god the author from man the subject and from virtue and piety its effects  xi shall we not admit the same method of arguing the same rules of logic reason and good sense to obtain in things spiritual and things corporeal in faith and science and shall we not use the same candor and make the same allowances in examining the revelations of god and the inventions of men for ought i see that philosopher cannot be free from bias and prejudice or be said to weigh things in an equal balance who shall maintain the doctrine of force and reject that of grace who shall admit the abstract idea of a triangle and at the same time ridicule the holy trinity but however partial or prejudiced other minute philosophers might be you have laid it down for a maxim that the same logic which obtains in other matters must be admitted in religion lys i think alciphron it would be more prudent to abide by the way of wit and humor than thus to try religion by the dry test of reason and logic alc fear not by all the rules of right reason it is absolutely impossible that any mystery and least of all the trinity should really be the object of mans faith euph i do not wonder you thought so as long as you maintained that no man could assent to a proposition without perceiving or framing in his mind distinct ideas marked by the terms of it but although terms are signs yet having granted that those signs may be significant though they should not suggest ideas represented by them provided they serve to regulate and influence our wills passions or conduct you have consequently granted that the mind of man may assent to propositions containing such terms when it is so directed or affected by them notwithstanding it should not perceive distinct ideas marked by those terms whence it seems to follow that a man may believe the doctrine of the trinity if he finds it revealed in holy scripture that the father the son and the holy ghost are god and that there is but one god although he does not frame in his mind any abstract or distinct ideas of trinity substance or personality provided that this doctrine of a creator redeemer and sanctifier makes proper impressions on his mind producing therein love hope gratitude and obedience and thereby becomes a lively operative principle influencing his life and actions agreeably to that notion of saving faith which is required in a christian this i say whether right or wrong seems to follow from your own principles and concessions but for further satisfaction it may not be amiss to inquire whether there be any thing parallel to this christian faith in the minute philosophy suppose a fine gentleman or lady of fashion who are too much employed to think for themselves and are only freethinkers at second hand have the advantage of being betimes initiated in the principles of your sect by conversing with men of depth and genius who have often declared it to be their opinion the world is governed either by fate or by chance it matters not which will you deny it possible for such persons to yield their assent to either of these propositions alc i will not euph and may not such their assent be properly called faith alc it may euph and yet it is possible those disciples of the minute philosophy may not dive so deep as to be able to frame any abstract or precise or any determinate idea whatsoever either of fate or of chance alc this too i grant euph so that according to you this same gentleman or lady may be said to believe or have faith where they have not ideas alc they may euph and may not this faith or persuasion produce real effects and show it self in the conduct and tenor of their lives freeing them from the fears of superstition and giving them a true relish of the world with a noble indolence or indifference about what comes after alc it may euph and may not christians with equal reason be allowed to believe the divinity of our savior or that in him god and man make one person and be verily persuaded thereof so far as for such faith or belief to become a real principle of life and conduct inasmuch as by virtue of such persuasion they submit to his government believe his doctrine and practice his precepts although they frame no abstract idea of the union between the divine and humane nature nor may be able to clear up the notion of person to the contentment of a minute philosopher to me it seems evident that if none but those who had nicely examined and could themselves explain the principle of individuation in man or untie the knots and answer the objections which may be raised even about humane personal identity would require of us to explain the divine mysteries we should not be often called upon for a clear and distinct idea of person in relation to the trinity nor would the difficulties on that head be often objected to our faith alc methinks there is no such mystery in personal identity euph pray in what do you take it to consist alc in consciousness euph whatever is possible may be supposed alc it may euph we will suppose now which is possible in the nature of things and reported to be fact that a person through some violent accident or distemper should fall into such a total oblivion as to lose all consciousness of his past life and former ideas i ask is he not still the same person alc he is the same man but not the same person indeed you ought not to suppose that a person loses its former consciousness for this is impossible though a man perhaps may but then he becomes another person in the same person it must be owned some old ideas may be lost and some new ones got but a total change is inconsistent with identity of person euph let us then suppose that a person has ideas and is conscious during a certain space of time which we will divide into three equal parts whereof the later terms are marked by the letters a b c in the first part of time the person gets a certain number of ideas which are retained in a during the second part of time he retains one half of his old ideas and loses the other half in place of which he acquires as many new ones so that in b his ideas are half old and half new and in the third part we suppose him to lose the remainder of the ideas acquired in the first and to get new ones in their stead which are retained in c together with those acquired in the second part of time is this a possible fair supposition alc it is euph upon these premises i am tempted to think one may demonstrate that personal identity does not consist in consciousness alc as how euph you shall judge but thus it seems to me the persons in a and b are the same being conscious of common ideas by supposition the person in b is for the same reason one and the same with the person in c therefore the person in a is the same with the person in c by that undoubted axiom quae convenient uni tertio convenient inter se but the person in c has no idea in common with the person in a therefore personal indentity does not consist in consciousness what do you think alciphron is not this a plain inference alc i tell you what i think you will never assist my faith by puzzling my knowledge  xii there is if i mistake not a practical faith or assent which shows it self in the will and actions of a man although his understanding may not be furnished with those abstract precise distinct ideas which whatever a philosopher may pretend are acknowledged to be above the talents of common men among whom nevertheless may be sound even according to your own concession many instances of such practical faith in other matters which do not concern religion what should hinder therefore but that doctrines relating to heavenly mysteries might be taught in this saving sense to vulgar minds which you may well think incapable of all teaching and faith in the sense you suppose which mistaken sense said crito has given occasion to much profane and misapplied raillery but all this may very justly be retorted on the minute philosophers themselves who confound scholasticism with christianity and impute to other men those perplexities chimaeras and inconsistent ideas which are often the workmanship of their own brains and proceed from their own wrong way of thinking who does not see that such an ideal abstracted faith is never thought of by the bulk of christians husbandmen for instance artisans or servants or what footsteps are there in the holy scripture to make us think that the wiredrawing of abstract ideas was a task injoined either jews or christians is there any thing in the law or the prophets the evangelists or apostles that looks like it every one whose understanding is not perverted by science falsely so called may see the saving faith of christians is quite of another kind a vital operative principle productive of charity and obedience alc what are we to think then of the disputes and decisions of the famous council of nice and so many subsequent councils what was the intention of those venerable fathers the homoousians and the homoiousians why did they disturb themselves and the world with hard words and subtle controversies cri whatever their intention was it could not be to beget nice abstracted ideas of mysteries in the minds of common christians this being evidently impossible nor does it appear that the bulk of christian men did in those days think it any part of their duty to lay aside the words shut their eyes and frame those abstract ideas any more than men now do of force time number or several other things about which they nevertheless believe know argue and dispute to me it seems that whatever was the source of these controversies and howsoever they were managed wherein humane infirmity must be supposed to have had its share the main end was not on either side to convey precise positive ideas to the minds of men by the use of those contested terms but rather a negative sense tending to exclude polytheism on the one hand and sabellianism on the other sozomen l   c    alc but what shall we say of so many learned and ingenious divines who from time to time have obliged the world with new explications of mysteries who having themselves professedly labored to acquire accurate ideas would recommend their discoveries and speculations to others for articles of faith cri to all such innovators in religion i would say with jerome why after so many centuries do you pretend to teach us what was untaught before why explain what neither peter nor paul thought necessary to be explained hieronym ad pammachium and oceanum de erroribus origenis and it must be owned that the explication of mysteries in divinity allowing the attempt as fruitless as the pursuit of the philosophers stone in chemistry or the perpetual motion in mechanics is no more than they chargeable on the profession it self but only on the wrongheaded professors of it  xiii it seems that what has been now said may be applied to other mysteries of our religion original sin for instance a man may find it impossible to form an idea of in abstract or of the manner of its transmission and yet the belief thereof may produce in his mind a salutary sense of his own unworthiness and the goodness of his redeemer from whence may follow good habits and from them good actions the genuine effects of faith which considered in its true light is a thing neither repugnant nor incomprehensible as some men would persuade us but suited even to vulgar capacities placed in the will and affections rather than in the understanding and producing holy lives rather than subtle theories faith i say is not an indolent perception but an operative persuasion of mind which ever works some suitable action disposition or emotion in those who have it as it were easy to prove and illustrate by innumerable instances taken from humane affairs and indeed while the christian religion is considered as an institution fitted to ordinary minds rather than to the nicer talents whether improved or puzzled of speculative men and our notions about faith are accordingly taken from the commerce of the world and practice of mankind rather than from the peculiar systems of refiners it will i think be no difficult matter to conceive and justify the meaning and use of our belief of mysteries against the most confident assertions and objections of the minute philosophers who are easily to be caught in those very snares which they have spun and spread for others and that humor of controversy the mother and nurse of heresies would doubtless very much abate if it was considered that things are to be rated not by the color shape or stamp so truly as by the weight if the moment of opinions had been by some litigious divines made the measure of their zeal it might have spared much trouble both to themselves and others certainly one that takes his notions of faith opinion and assent from common sense and common use and has maturely weighed the nature of signs and language will not be so apt to controvert the wording of a mystery or to break the peace of the church for the sake of retaining or rejecting a term  xiv alc it seems euphranor and you would persuade me into an opinion that there is nothing so singularly absurd as we are apt to think in the belief of mysteries and that a man need not renounce his reason to maintain his religion but if this were true how comes it to pass that in proportion as men abound in knowledge they dwindle in faith euph o alciphron i have learned from you that there is nothing like going to the bottom of things and analyzing them into their first principles i shall therefore make an essay of this method for clearing up the nature of faith with what success i shall leave you to determine for i dare not pronounce my self on my own judgment whether it be right or wrong but thus it seems to me the objections made to faith are by no means an effect of knowledge but proceed rather from an ignorance of what knowledge is which ignorance may possibly be sound even in those who pass for masters of this or that particular branch of knowledge science and faith agree in this that they both imply an assent of the mind and as the nature of the first is most clear and evident it should be first considered in order to cast a light on the other to trace things from their original it seems that the humane mind naturally furnished with the ideas of things particular and concrete and being designed not for the bare intuition of ideas but for action or operation about them and pursuing her own happiness therein stands in need of certain general rules or theorems to direct her operations in this pursuit the supplying which want is the true original reasonable end of studying the arts and sciences now these rules being general it follows that they are not to be obtained by the mere consideration of the original ideas or particular things but by the means of marks or signs which being so far forth universal become the immediate instruments and materials of science it is not therefore by mere contemplation of particular things and much less of their abstract general ideas that the mind makes her progress but by an apposite choice and skilful management of signs for instance force and number taken in concrete with there adjuncts subjects and signs are what every one knows and considered in abstract so as making precise ideas of themselves they are what no body can comprehend that their abstract nature therefore is not the foundation of science is plain and that barely considering their ideas in concrete is not the method to advance in the respective sciences is what every one that reflects may see nothing being more evident than that one who can neither write nor read in common use understands the meaning of numeral words as well as the best philosopher or mathematician  xv but here lies the difference the one who understands the notation of numbers by means thereof is able to express briefly and distinctly all the variety and degrees of number and to perform with ease and dispatch several arithmetical operations by the help of general rules of all which operations as the use in humane life is very evident so it is no less evident that the performing them depends on the aptness of the notation if we suppose rude mankind without the use of language it may be presumed they would be ignorant of arithmetic but the use of names by the repetition whereof in a certain order they might express endless degrees of number would be the first step toward that science the next step would be to devise proper marks of a permanent nature and visible to the eye the kind and order whereof must be chose with judgment and accommodated to the names which marking or notation would in proportion as it was apt and regular facilitate the invention and application of general rules to assist the mind in reasoning and judging in extending recording and communicating its knowledge about numbers in which theory and operations the mind is immediately occupied about the signs or notes by mediation of which it is directed to act about things or number in concrete as the logicians call it without ever considering the simple abstract intellectual general idea of number i imagine one need not think much to be convinced that the science of arithmetic in its rise operations rules and theorems is altogether conversant about the artificial use of signs names and characters these names and characters are universal inasmuch as they are signs the names are referred to things and the characters to names and both to operation the names being few and proceeding by a certain analogy the characters will be more useful the simpler they are and the more aptly they express this analogy hence the old notation by letters was more useful than words written at length and the modern notation by figures expressing the progression or analogy of the names by their simple places is much preferable to that for ease and expedition as the invention of algebraical symbols is to this for extensive and general use as arithmetic and algebra are sciences of great clearness certainty and extent which are immediately conversant about signs upon the skilful use and management whereof they entirely depend so a little attention to them may possibly help us to judge of the progress of the mind in other sciences which though differing in nature design and object may yet agree in the general methods of proof and inquiry  xvi if i mistake not all sciences so far as they are universal and demonstrable by humane reason will be found conversant about signs as their immediate object though these in the application are referred to things the reason whereof is not difficult to comprehend for as the mind is better acquainted with some sort of objects which are earlier suggested to it strike it more sensibly or are more easily comprehended than others it is naturally led to subtitute those objects for such as are more subtle fleeting or difficult to conceive nothing i say is more natural than to make the things we know a step toward those we do not know and to explain and represent things less familiar by others which are more so now it is certain we imagine before we reflect and we perceive by sense before we imagine and of all our senses the sight is the most clear distinct various agreeable and comprehensive hence it is natural to assist the intellect by the imagination the imagination by sense and the other senses by sight hence figures metaphors and types we illustrate spiritual things by corporeal we substitute sounds for thoughts and written letters for sounds emblems symbols and hieroglyphics for things too obscure to strike and too various or too fleeting to be retained we substitute things imaginable for things intelligible sensible things for imaginable smaller things for those that are too great to comprehend easily and greater things for such as are too small to be discerned distinctly present things for absent permanent for perishing and visible for invisible hence the use of models and diagrams hence right lines are substituted for time velocity and other things of very different natures hence we speak of spirits in a figurative style expressing the operations of the mind by allusions and terms borrowed from sensible things such as apprehend conceive reflect discourse and such like and hence those allegories which illustrate things intellectual by visions exhibited to the fancy plato for instance represents the mind presiding in her vehicle by the driver of a winged chariot which sometimes moults and droops this chariot is drawn by two horses the one good and of a good race the other of a contrary kind symbolically expressing the tendency of the mind toward the divinity as she soars or is born aloft by two instincts like wings the one in the intellect toward truth the other in the will toward excellence which instincts moult or are weakened by sensual inclinations expressing also her alternate elevations and depressions the struggles between reason and appetite like horses that go an unequal pace or draw different ways embarrassing the soul in her progress to perfection i am inclined to think the doctrine of signs a point of great importance and general extent which if duly considered would cast no small light upon things and afford a just and genuine solution of many difficulties  xvii thus much upon the whole may be said of all signs that they do not always suggest ideas signified to the mind that when they suggest ideas they are not general abstract ideas that they have other uses besides barely standing for and exhibiting ideas such as raising proper emotions producing certain dispositions or habits of mind and directing our actions in pursuit of that happiness which is the ultimate end and design the primary spring and motive that sets rational agents at work that the true end of speech reason science faith assent in all its different degrees is not merely or principally or always the imparting or acquiring of ideas but rather something of an active operative nature tending to a conceived good which may sometimes be obtained not only although the ideas marked are not offered to the mind but even although there should be no possibility of offering or exhibiting any such idea to the mind for instance the algebraic mark which denotes the root of a negative square has its use in logistic operations although it be impossible to form an idea of any such quantity and what is true of algebraic signs is also true of words or language modern algebra being in fact a more short apposite and artificial sort of language and it being possible to express by words at length though less conveniently all the steps of an algebraical process and it must be confessed that even the mathematical sciences themselves which above all others are reckoned the most clear and certain if they are considered not as instruments to direct our practice but as speculations to employ our curiosity will be found to fall short in many instances of those clear and distinct ideas which it seems the minute philosophers of this age whether knowingly or ignorantly expect and insist upon in the mysteries of religion  xviii be the science or subject what it will whenever men quit particulars for generalities things concrete for abstractions when they forsake practical views and the useful purposes of knowledge for barren speculation considering means and instruments as ultimate ends and laboring to attain precise ideas which they suppose indiscriminately annexed to all terms they will be sure to embarrass themselves with difficulties and disputes such are those which have sprung up in geometry about the nature of the angle of contact the doctrine of proportions of indivisibles infinitesimals and diverse other points notwithstanding all which that science is very rightly esteemed an excellent and useful one and is really sound to be so in many occasions of humane life wherein it governs and directs the actions of men so that by the aid or influence thereof those operations become just and accurate which would otherwise be faulty and uncertain and from a parity of reason we should not conclude any other doctrines which govern influence or direct the mind of man to be any more than that the less true or excellent because they afford matter of controversy and useless speculation to curious and licentious wits particularly those articles of our christian faith which in proportion as they are believed persuade and as they persuade influence the lives and actions of men as to the perplexity of contradictions and abstracted notions in all parts whether of humane science or divine faith cavillers may equally object and unwary persons incur while the judicious avoid it there is no need to depart from the received rules of reasoning to justify the belief of christians and if any pious men think otherwise it may be supposed an effect not of religion or of reason but only of humane weakness if this age be singularly productive of infidels i shall not therefore conclude it to be more knowing but only more presuming than former ages and their conceit i doubt is not the effect of consideration to me it seems that the more thoroughly and extensively any man shall consider and scan the principles objects and methods of proceeding in arts and sciences the more he will be convinced there is no weight in those plausible objections that are made against the mysteries of faith which it will be no difficult matter for him to maintain or justify in the received method of arguing on the common principles of logic and by numberless avowed parallel cases throughout the several branches of humane knowledge in all which the supposition of abstract ideas creates the same difficulties  xix alc i will allow euphranor this reasoning of yours to have all the force you meant it should have i freely own there may be mysteries that we may believe where we do not understand and that faith may be of use although its object is not distinctly apprehended in a word i grant their may be faith and mysteries in other things but not in religion and that for this plain reason because it is absurd to suppose there should be any such thing as religion and if there be no religion it follows there cannot be religious faith or mysteries religion it is evident implies the worship of a god which worship supposes rewards and punishments which suppose merits and demerits actions good and evil and these suppose humane liberty a thing impossible and consequently religion a thing built thereon must be an unreasonable absurd thing there can be no rational hopes or fears where there is no guilt nor any guilt where there is nothing done but what unavoidably follows from the structure of the world and the laws of motion corporeal objects strike on the organs of sense whence ensues a vibration in the nerves which being communicated to the soul or animal spirit in the brain or root of the nerves produces therein that motion called volition and this produces a new determination in the spirits causing them to flow into such nerves as must necessarily by the laws of mechanism produce such certain actions this being the case it follows that those things which vulgarly pass for humane actions are to be esteemed mechanical and that they are falsely ascribed to a free principle there is therefore no foundation for praise or blame fear or hope reward or punishment nor consequently for religion which as i observed before is built upon and supposes those things euph you imagine alciphron if i rightly understand you that man is a sort of organ played on by outward objects which according to the different shape and texture of the nerves produce different motions and effects therein alc man may indeed be fitly compared to an organ but a puppet is the very thing you must know that certain particles issuing forth in right lines from all sensible objects compose so many rays or filaments which drive draw and actuate every part of the soul and body of man just as threads or wires do the joints of that little wooden machine vulgarly called a puppet with this only difference that the latter are gross and visible to common eyes whereas the former are too fine and subtle to be discerned by any but a sagacious freethinker this admirably accounts for all those operations which we have been taught to ascribe to a thinking principle within us euph this is an ingenious thought and must be of great use in freeing men from all anxiety about moral notions as it transfers the principle of action from the humane soul to things outward and foreign but i have my scruples about it for you suppose the mind in a literal sense to be moved and its volitions to be mere motions now if another should affirm as it is not impossible some or other may that the soul is incorporeal and that motion is one thing and volition another i would fain know how you could make your point clear to such a one it must be owned very clear to those who admit the soul to be corporeal and all her acts to be but so many motions upon this supposition indeed the light wherein you place humane nature is no less true than it is fine and new but let any one deny this supposition which is easily done and the whole superstructure falls to the ground if we grant the abovementiond points i will not deny a fatal necessity must ensue but i see no reason for granting them on the contrary it seems plain that motion and thought are two things as really and as manifestly distinct as a triangle and a sound it seems therefore that in order to prove the necessity of humane actions you suppose what wants proof as much as the very point to be proved  xx alc but supposing the mind incorporeal i shall nevertheless be able to prove my point not to amuse you with far fetched arguments i shall only desire you to look into your own breast and observe how things pass there when an object offers it self to the mind first the understanding considers it in the next place the judgment decrees about it as a thing to be chosen or rejected to be omitted or done in this or that manner and this decree of the judgment does necessarily determine the will whose office is merely to execute what is ordained by another faculty consequently there is no such thing as freedom of the will for that which is necessary cannot be free in freedom there should be an indifference to either side of the question a power to act or not to act without perscription or control and without this indifference and this power it is evident the will cannot be free but it is no less evident that the will is not indifferent in its actions being absolutely determined and governed by the judgment now whatever moves the judgment whether the greatest present uneasiness or the greatest apparent good or whatever else it be it is all one to the point in hand the will being ever concluded and controlled by the judgment is in all cases alike under necessity there is indeed throughout the whole of humane nature nothing like a principle of freedom every faculty being determined in all its acts by something foreign to it the understanding for instance cannot alter its idea but must necessarily see it such as it presents it self the appetites by a natural necessity are carried toward their respective objects reason cannot infer indifferently any thing from any thing but is limited by the nature and connection of things and the eternal rules of reasoning and as this is confessedly the case of all other faculties so it equally holds with respect to the will it self as has been already shown and if we may credit the divine characterizer of our times this above all others must be allowed the most slavish faculty appetite says that noble writer which is elder brother to reason being the lad of stronger growth is sure on every contest to take the advantage of drawing all to his own side and will so highly boasted is but at best a football or top between those youngsters who prove very unfortunately matched till the youngest instead of now and then a kick or lash bestowed to little purpose forsakes the ball or top it self and begins to lay about his elder brother cri this beautiful parable for style and manner might equal those of a known english writer in low life renowned for allegory were it not a little incorrect making the weaker lad find his account in laying about the stronger alc this is helped by supposing the stronger lad the greater coward but be that as it will so far as it relates to the point in hand this is a clear state of the case the same point may be also proved from the prescience of god that which is certainly foreknown will certainly be and what is certain is necessary and necessary actions cannot be the effect of free will thus you have this fundamental point of our freethinking philosophy demonstrated different ways euph tell me alciphron do you think it implies a contradiction that god should make a man free alc i do not euph it is then possible there may be such a thing alc this i do not deny euph you can therefore conceive and suppose such a free agent alc admitting that i can what then euph would not such an one think that he acted alc he would euph and condemn himself for some actions and approve himself for others alc this too i grant euph would he not think he deserved reward or punishment alc he would euph and are not all these characters actually found in man alc they are euph tell me now what other character of your supposed free agent may not actually be found in man for if there is none such we must conclude that man has all the marks of a free agent alc let me see i was certainly overseen in granting it possible even for almighty power to make such a thing as a free humane agent i wonder how i came to make such an absurd concession after what had been as i observed before demonstrated so many different ways euph o alciphron it is vulgarly observed that men judge of others by themselves but in judging of me by this rule you may be mistaken many things are plain to one of your sagacity which are not so to me who am often bewildered rather than enlightened by those very proofs that with you pass for clear and evident and indeed be the inference never so just yet so long as the premises are not clear i cannot be thoroughly convinced you must give me leave therefore to propose some questions the solution of which may perhaps show what at present i am not able to discern alc i shall leave what has been said with you to consider and ruminate upon it is now time to set out on our journey there is therefore no room for a long string of question and answer  xxi euph i shall then only beg leave in a summary manner to make a remark or two on what you have advanced in the first place i observe you take that for granted which i cannot grant when you assert whatever is certain the same to be necessary to me certain and necessary seem very different there being nothing in the former notion that implies constraint nor consequently which may not consist with a mans being accountable for his actions if it is foreseen that such an action shall be done may it not also be foreseen that it shall be an effect of humane choice and liberty in the next place i observe that you very nicely abstract and distinguish the actions of the mind judgment and will that you make use of such terms as power faculty act determination indifference freedom necessity and the like as if they stood for distinct abstract ideas and that this supposition seems to ensnare the mind into the same perplexities and errors which in all other instances are observed to attend the doctrine of abstraction it is self evident that there is such a thing as motion and yet there have been found philosophers who by refined reasoning would undertake to prove there was no such thing walking before them was thought the proper way to confute those ingenious men it is no less evident that man is a free agent and though by abstracted reasonings you should puzzle me and seem to prove the contrary yet so long as i am conscious of my own actions this inward evidence of plain fact will bear me up against all your reasonings however subtle and refined the confuting plain points by obscure ones may perhaps convince me of the ability of your philosophers but never of their tenets i cannot conceive why the acute cratylus should suppose a power of acting in the appetite and reason and none at all in the will allowing i say the distinction of three such beings in the mind i do not see how this could be true but if i cannot abstract and distinguish so many beings in the soul of man so accurately as you do i do not find it necessary since it is evident to me in the gross and concrete that i am a free agent nor will it avail to say the will is governed by the judgment or determined by the object while in every sudden common case i cannot discern nor abstract the decree of the judgment from the command of the will while i know the sensible object to be absolutely inert and lastly while i am conscious that i am an active being who can and do determine my self if i should suppose things spiritual to be corporeal or refine things actual and real into general abstracted notions or by metaphysical skill split things simple and individual into manifold parts i do not know what may follow but if i take things as they are and ask any plain untutored man whether he acts or is free in this or that particular action he readily assents and i as readily believe him from what i find within and thus by an induction of particulars i may conclude man to be a free agent although i may be puzzled to define or conceive a notion of freedom in general and abstract and if man be free he is plainly accountable but if you shall define abstract suppose and it shall follow that according to your definitions abstractions and suppositions there can be no freedom in man and you shall thence infer that he is not accountable i shall make bold to depart from your metaphysical abstracted sense and appeal to the common sense of mankind  xxii if we consider the notions that obtain in the world of guilt and merit praise and blame accountable and unaccountable we shall find the common question in order to applaud or censure acquit or condemn a man is whether he did such an action and whether he was himself when he did it which comes to the same thing it should seem therefore that in the ordinary commerce of mankind any person is esteemed accountable simply as he is an agent and though you should tell me that man is inactive and that the sensible objects act upon him yet my own experience assures me of the contrary i know i act and what i act i am accountable for and if this be true the foundation of religion and morality remains unshaken religion i say is concerned no farther than that man should be accountable and this he is according to my sense and the common sense of the world if he acts and that he does act is self evident the grounds therefore and ends of religion are secured whether your philosophic notion of liberty agrees with mans actions or no and whether his actions are certain or contingent the question being not whether he did it with a free will or what determined his will not whether it was certain or foreknown that he would do it but only whether he did it wilfully as what must entitle him to the guilt or merit of it alc but still the question recurs whether man be free euph to determine this question ought we not first to determine what is meant by the word free alc we ought euph in my opinion a man is said to be free so far forth as he can do what he will is this so or is it not alc it seems so euph man therefore acting according to his will is to be accounted free alc this i admit to be true in the vulgar sense but a philosopher goes higher and inquires whether man be free to will euph that is whether he can will as he wills i know not how philosophical it may be to ask this question but it seems very unintelligible the notions of guilt and merit justice and reward are in the minds of men antecedent to all metaphysical disquisitions and according to those received natural notions it is not doubted that man is accountable that he acts and is selfdetermined  xxiii but a minute philosopher shall in virtue of wrong suppositions confound things most evidently distinct body for instance with spirit motion with volition certainty with necessity and an abstracter or refiner shall so analyze the most simple instantaneous act of the mind as to distinguish therein diverse faculties and tendencies principles and operations causes and effects and having abstracted supposed and reasoned upon principles gratuitous and obscure such a one he will conclude it is no act at all and man no agent but a puppet or an organ played on by outward objects and his will a top or a football and this passes for philosophy and freethinking perhaps this may be what it passes for but it by no means seems a natural or just way of thinking to me it seems that if we begin from things particular and concrete and thence proceed to general notions and conclusions there will be no difficulty in this matter but if we begin with generalities and lay our foundation in abstract ideas we shall find our selves entangled and lost in a labyrinth of our own making i need not observe what every one must see the ridicule of proving man no agent and yet pleading for free thought and action of setting up at once for advocates of liberty and necessity i have hastily thrown together these hints or remarks on what you call a fundamental article of the minute philosophy and your method of proving it which seems to furnish an admirable specimen of the sophistry of abstract ideas if in this summary way i have been more dogmatical than became me you must excuse what you occasioned by declining a joint and leisurely examination of the truth alc i think we have examined matters sufficiently cri to all you have said against humane liberty it is a sufficient answer to observe that your arguments proceed upon an erroneous supposition either of the souls being corporeal or of abstract ideas and on the other hand there is not need of much inquiry to be convinced of two points than which none are more evident more obvious and more universally admitted by men of all sorts learned or unlearned in all times and places to wit that man acts and is accountable for his actions whatever abstracters refiners or men prejudiced to a false hypothesis may pretend it is if i mistake not evident to every thinking man of common sense that humane minds are so far from being engines or footballs acted upon and bandied about by corporeal objects without any inward principle of freedom or action that the only original true notions that we have of freedom agent or action are obtained by reflecting on our selves and the operations of our own minds the singularity and credulity of minute philosophers who suffer themselves to be abused by the paralogisms of three or four eminent patriarchs of infidelity in the last age is i think not to be matched there being no instance of bigoted superstition the ringleaders whereof have been able to seduce their followers more openly and more widely from the plain dictates of nature and common sense  xxiv alc it has been always an objection against the discoverers of truth that they depart from received opinions the character of singularity is a tax on freethinking and as such we most willingly bear it and glory in it a genuine philosopher is never modest in a false sense to the preferring authority before reason or an old and common opinion before a true one which false modesty as it discourages men from treading in untrodden paths or striking out new light is above all other qualities the greatest enemy to freethinking cri authority in disputable points will have its weight with a judicious mind which yet will follow evidence wherever it leads without preferring we may allow it a good second to reason your gentlemen therefore of the minute philosophy may spare a world of common place upon reason and light and discoveries we are not attached to authority against reason nor afraid of untrodden paths that lead to truth and are ready to follow a new light when we are sure it is no ignis fatuus reason may oblige a man to believe against his inclinations but why should a man quit salutary notions for others not less unreasonable than pernicious your schemes and principles and boasted demonstrations have been at large proposed and examined you have shifted your notions successively retreated from one scheme to another and in the end renounced them all your objections have been treated in the same manner and with the same event if we except all that relates to the particular errors and faults of private persons and difficulties which from the nature of things we are not obliged to explain it is surprising to see after such magnificent threats how little remains that can amount to a pertinent objection against the christian religion what you have produced has been tried by the fair test of reason and though you should hope to prevail by ridicule when you cannot by reason yet in the upshot i apprehend you will find it impracticable to destroy all sense of religion make your countrymen ever so vicious ignorant and profane men will still be disposed to look up to a supreme being religion right or wrong will subsist in some shape or other and some worship there will surely be either of god or the creature as for your ridicule can any thing be more ridiculous than to see the most unmeaning men of the age set up for freethinkers men so strong in assertion and yet so weak in argument advocates for freedom introducing a fatality patriots trampling on the laws of their country and pretenders to virtue destroying the motives of it let any impartial man but cast an eye on the opinions of the minute philosophers and then say if any thing can be more ridiculous than to believe such things and at the same time laugh at credulity  xxv lys say what you will we have the laughers on our side and as for your reasoning i take it to be another name for sophistry cri and i suppose by the same rule you take your own sophisms for arguments to speak plainly i know no sort of sophism that is not employed by minute philosophers against religion they are guilty of a petitio principii in taking for granted that we believe contradictions of non causa pro causa in affirming that uncharitable feuds and discords are the effects of christianity of ignoratio elenchi in expecting demonstration where we pretend only to faith if i was not afraid to offend the delicacy of polite ears nothing were easier than to assign instances of every kind of sophism which would show how skilful your own philosophers are in the practice of that sophistry you impute to others euph for my own part if sophistry be the art or faculty of deceiving other men i must acquit these gentlemen of it they seem to have led me a progress through atheism libertinism enthusiasm fatalism not to convince me of the truth of any of them so much as to confirm me in my own way of thinking they have exposed their fairy ware not to cheat but divert us as i know them to be professed masters of ridicule so in a serious sense i know not what to make of them alc you do not know what to make of us i should be sorry you did he must be a superficial philosopher that is soon fathomed  xxvi cri the ambiguous character is it seems the sure way to fame and esteem in the learned world as it stands constituted at present when the ingenious reader is at a loss to determine whether his author be atheist or deist or polytheist stoic or epicurean skeptic or dogmatist infidel or enthusiast in jest or in earnest he concludes him without hesitation to be aenigmatical and profound in fact it is true of the most admired writers of the age that no man alive can tell what to make of them or what they would be at alc we have among us moles that dig deep under ground and eagles that soar out of sight we can act all parts and become all opinions putting them on or off with great freedom of wit and humor euph it seems then you are a pair of inscrutable unfathomable fashionable philosophers alc it cannot be denied euph but i remember you set out with an open dogmatical air and talked of plain principles and evident reasoning promised to make things as clear as noonday to extirpate wrong notions and plant right in their stead soon after you began to recede from you first notions and adopt others you advanced one while and retreated another yielded and retracted said and unsaid and after having followed you through so many untrodden paths and intricate mazes i find my self never the nearer alc did we not tell you the gentlemen of our sect are great proficients in raillery euph but methinks it is a vain attempt for a plain man of any settled belief or principles to engage with such slippery fugitive changeable philosophers if seems as it a man should stand still in the same place while his adversary chooses and changes his situation has full range and liberty to traverse the field and attack him on all sides and in all shapes from a nearer or farther distance on horseback or on foot in light or heavy armor in close fight or with missive weapons alc it must be owned a gentleman has great advantage over a straitlaced pedant or bigot euph but after all what am i the better for the conversation of two such knowing gentlemen i hoped to have unlearned my errors and to have learned truths from you but to my great disappointment i do not find that i am either untaught or taught alc to unteach men their prejudices is a difficult task and this must first be done before we can pretend to teach them the truth besides we have at present no time to prove and argue euph but suppose my mind white paper and without being at any pains to extirpate my opinions or prove your own only say what you would write thereon or what you would teach me in case i were teacheable be for once in earnest and let me know some one conclusion of yours before we part or i shall entreat crito to violate the laws of hospitality toward those who have violated the laws of philosophy by hanging out false lights to one benighted in ignorance and error i appeal to you said he turning to crito whether these philosophical knighterrants should not be confined in this castle of yours till they make reparation euphranor has reason said crito and my sentence is that you remain here in durance till you have done something toward satisfying the engagement i am under having promised he should know your opinions from your selves which you also agreed to  xxvii alc since it must be so i will now reveal what i take to be the sum and substance the grand arcanum and ultimate conclusion of our sect and that in two words  cri you are then a downright skeptic but skeptic as you are you own it probable there is a god certain that the christian religion is useful possible it may be true certain that if it be the minute philosophers are in a bad way this being the case how can it be questioned what course a wise man should take whether the principles of christians or infidels are truest may be made a question but which are safest can be none certainly if you doubt of all opinions you must doubt of your own and then for ought you know the christian may be true the more doubt the more room there is for faith a skeptic of all men having the least right to demand evidence but whatever uncertainty there may be in other points thus much is certain either there is or is not a god there is or is not a revelation man either is or is not an agent the soul is or is not immortal if the negatives are not sure the affirmatives are possible if the negatives are improbable the affirmatives are probable in proportion as any of your ingenious men finds himself unable to prove any one of these negatives he has grounds to suspect he may be mistaken a minute philosopher therefore that would act a consistent part should have the diffidence the modesty and the timidity as well as the doubts of a skeptic not pretend to an ocean of light and then lead us to an abyss of darkness if i have any notion of ridicule this is most ridiculous but your ridiculing what for ought you know may be true i can make no sense of it is neither acting as a wise man with regard to your own interest nor as a good man with regard to that of your country  xxviii tully says somewhere aut undique religionem toll aut usquequaque conserva either let us have no religion at all or let it be respected if any single instance can be shown of a people that ever prospered without some religion or if there be any religion better than the christian propose it in the grand assembly of the nation to change our constitution and either live without religion or introduce that new religion a skeptic as well as other men is member of a community and can distinguish between god and evil natural or political be this then his guide as a patriot though he be no christian or if he does not pretend even to this discernment let him not pretend to correct or alter what he knows nothing of neither let him that only doubts behave as if he could demonstrate timagoras is wont to say i find my country in possession of certain tenets they appear to have an useful tendency and as such are encouraged by the legislature they make a main part of our constitution i do not find these innovators can disprove them or substitute things more useful and certain in their stead out of regard therefore to the good of mankind and the laws of my country i shall acquiesce in them i do not say timagoras is a christian but i reckon him a patriot not to inquire in a point of so great concern is folly but it is still a higher degree of folly to condemn without inquiring lysicles seemed heartily tired of this conversation it is now late said he to alciphron and all things are ready for our departure every one has his own way of thinking and it is as impossible for me to adopt another mans as to make his complexion and features mine alciphron pleaded that having complied with euphranors conditions they were now at liberty and euphranor answered that all he desired having been to know their tenets he had nothing further to pretend  xxix the philosophers being gone i observed to crito how unaccountable it was that men so easy to confute should yet be so difficult to convince this said crito is accounted for by aristotle who tells us that arguments have not an effect on all men but only on them whose minds are prepared by education and custom as land is for seed ethic ad nicom l  0 c    make a point never so clear it is great odds that a man whose habits and the bent of whose mind lie a contrary way shall be unable to comprehend it so weak a thing is reason in competition with inclination i replied this answer might hold with respect to other persons and other times but when the question was of inquisitive men in an age wherein reason was so much cultivated and thinking so much in vogue it did not seem satisfactory i have known it remarked said crito by a man of much observation that in the present age thinking is more talked of but less practiced than in ancient times and that since the revival of learning men have read much and wrote much but thought little insomuch that with us to think closely and justly is the least part of a learned man and none at all of a polite man the freethinkers it must be owned make great pretensions to thinking and yet they show but little exactness in it a lively man said he and what the world calls a man of sense are often destitute of this talent which is not a mere gift of nature but must be improved and perfected by much attention and exercise on very different subjects a thing of more pains and time than the hasty men of parts in our age care to take such were the sentiments of a judicious friend of mine and if you are not already sufficiently convinced of these truths you need only cast an eye on the dark and confused but nevertheless admired writers of this famous sect and then you will be able to judge whether those who are led by men of such wrong heads can have very good ones of their own such for instance was spinosa the great leader of our modern infidels in whom are to be found many schemes and notions much admired and followed of late years such as undermining religion under the pretense of vindicating and explaining it the maintaining it not necessary to believe in christ according to the flesh the persuading men that miracles are to be understood only in a spiritual and allegorical sense that vice is not so bad a thing as we are apt to think that men are mere machines impelled by fatal necessity i have heard said i spinosa represented as a man of close argument and demonstration he did replied crito demonstrate but it was after such a manner as any one may demonstrate any thing allow a man the privilege to make his own definitions of common words and it will be no hard matter for him to infer conclusions which in one sense shall be true and in another false at once seeming paradoxes and manifest truisms for example let but spinosa define natural right to be natural power and he will easily demonstrate that whatever a man can do he has a right to do tractat politic c    nothing can be plainer than the folly of this proceeding but our pretenders to the lumen siccum are often so passionately prejudiced against religion as to swallow the grossest nonsense and sophistry of weak and wicked writers for demonstration  xxx and so great a noise do these men make with their thinking reasoning and demonstrating as to prejudice some wellmeaning persons against all use and improvement of reason honest demea having seen a neighbor of his ruined by the vices of a freethinking son contracted such a prejudice against thinking that he would not suffer his own to read euclid being told it might teach him to think till a friend convinced him the epidemical distemper was not thinking but only the want and affectation of it i know an eminent freethinker who never goes to bed without a gallon of wine in his belly and is sure to replenish before the fumes are off his brain by which means he has not had one sober thought these seven years another that would not for the world lose the privilege and reputation of freethinking who games all night and lies in bed all day and as for the outside or appearance of thought in that meagre minute philosopher ibycus it is an effect not of thinking but of carking cheating and writing in an office strange said he that such men should set up for freethinkers but it is yet more strange that other men should be out of conceit with thinking and reasoning for the sake of such pretenders i answered that some good men conceived an opposition between reason and religion faith and knowledge nature and grace and that consequently the way to promote religion was to quench the light of nature and discourage all rational inquiry  xxxi how right the intentions of these men may be replied crito i shall not say but surely their notions are very wrong can any thing be more dishonorable to religion than the representing it as an unreasonable unnatural ignorant institution god is the father of all lights whether natural or revealed natural concupiscence is one thing and the light of nature another you cannot therefore argue from the former against the latter neither can you from science falsely so called against real knowledge whatever therefore is said of the one in holy scripture is not to be interpreted of the other i insisted that humane learning in the hands of divines had from time to time created great disputes and divisions in the church as abstracted metaphysics replied crito have always had a tendency to produce disputes among christians as well as other men so it should seem that genuine truth and knowledge would allay this humor which makes men sacrifice the undisputed duties of peace and charity to disputable notions after all said i whatever may be said for reason it is plain the skeptics and infidels of the age are not to be cured by it i will not dispute this point said crito in order to cure a distemper you should consider what produced it had men reasoned themselves into a wrong opinion one might hope to reason them out of it but this is not the case the infidelity of most minute philosophers seeming an effect of very different motives from thought and reason little incidents vanity disgust humor inclination without the least assistance from reason are often known to make infidels where the general tendency of a doctrine is disagreeable the mind is prepared to relish and improve every thing that with the least pretense seems to make against it hence the coarse manners of a country curate the polite ones of a chaplain the wit of a minute philosopher a jest a song a tale can serve instead of a reason for infidelity bupalus preferred a rake in the church and then made use of him as an argument against it vice indolence faction and fashion produce minute philosophers and mere petulancy not a few who then can expect a thing so irrational and capricious should yield to reason it may nevertheless be worth while to argue against such men and expose their fallacies if not for their own sake yet for the sake of others as it may lessen their credit and prevent the growth of their sect by removing a prejudice in their favor which sometimes inclines others as well as themselves to think they have made a monopoly of humane reason  xxxii the most general pretext which looks like reason is taken from the variety of opinions about religion this is a resting stone to a lazy and superficial mind but one of more spirit and a juster way of thinking makes it a step whence he looks about and proceeds to examine and compare the differing institutions of religion he will observe which of these is the most sublime and rational in its doctrines most venerable in its mysteries most useful in its precepts most decent in its worship which creates the noblest hopes and most worthy views he will consider their rise and progress which owes least to humane arts or arms which flatters the senses and gross inclinations of men which adorns and improves the most excellent part of our nature which has been propagated in the most wonderful manner which has surmounted the greatest difficulties or showed the most disinterested zeal and sincerity in its professors he will inquire which best accords with nature and history he will consider what savours of the world and what looks like wisdom from above he will be careful to separate humane allay from that which is divine and upon the whole form his judgment like a reasonable freethinker but instead of taking such a rational course one of these hasty skeptics shall conclude without demurring there is no wisdom in politics no honesty in dealings no knowledge in philosophy no truth in religion and all by one and the same sort of inference from the numerous examples of folly knavery ignorance and error which are to be met with in the world but as those who are unknowing in every thing else imagine themselves sharpsighted in religion this learned sophism is oftenest levelled against christianity  xxxiii in my opinion he that would convince an infidel who can be brought to reason ought in the first place clearly to convince him of the being of a god it seeming to me that any man who is really a theist cannot be an enemy to the christian religion and that the ignorance or disbelief of this fundamental point is that which at bottom constitutes the minute philosopher i imagine they who are acquainted with the great authors in the minute philosophy need not be told of this the being of a god is capable of clear proof and a proper object of humane reason whereas the mysteries of his nature and indeed whatever there is of mystery in religion to endeavor to explain and prove by reason is a vain attempt it is sufficient if we can show there is nothing absurd or repugnant in our belief of those points and instead of framing hypotheses to explain them we use our reason only for answering the objections brought against them but on all occasions we ought to distinguish the serious modest ingenuous man of sense who has scruples about religion and behaves like a prudent man in doubt from the minute philosophers those profane and conceited men who must needs proselyte others to their own doubts when one of this stamp presents himself we should consider what species he is of whether a first or a secondhand philosopher a libertine scorner or skeptic each character requiring a peculiar treatment some men are too ignorant to be humble without which there can be no docility but though a man must in some degree have thought and considered to be capable of being convinced yet it is possible the most ignorant may be laughed out of his opinions i knew a woman of sense reduce two minute philosophers who had long been a nuisance to the neighborhood by taking her cue from their predominant affectations the one set up for being the most incredulous man upon earth the other for the most unbounded freedom she observed to the first that he who had credulity sufficient to trust the most valuable things his life and fortune to his apothecary and lawyer ridiculously affected the character of incredulous by refusing to trust his soul a thing in his own account but a mere trifle to his parish priest the other being what you call a beau she made sensible how absolute a slave he was in point of dress to him the most important thing in the world while he was earnestly contending for a liberty of thinking with which he never troubled his head and how much more it concerned and became him to assert an independency on fashion and obtain scope for his genius where it was best qualified to exert it self the minute philosophers at first hand are very few and considered in themselves of small consequence but their followers who pin their faith upon them are numerous and not less confident than credulous there being something in the air and manner of these secondhand philosophers very apt to disconcert a man of gravity and argument and much more difficult to be born than the weight of their objections  xxxiv crito having made an end euphranor declared it to be his opinion that it would much conduce to the public benefit if instead of discouraging freethinking there was erected in the midst of this free country a dianoetic academy or seminary for freethinkers provided with retired chambers and galleries and shady walks and groves where after seven years spent in silence and meditation a man might commence a genuine freethinker and from that time forward have license to think what he pleased and a badge to distinguish him from counterfeits in good earnest said crito i imagine that thinking is the great desideratum of the present age and that the real cause of whatever is amiss may justly be reckoned the general neglect of education in those who need it most the people of fashion what can be expected where those who have the most influence have the least sense and those who are sure to be followed set the worst example where youth so uneducated are yet so forward where modesty is esteemed pufillanimity and a deference to years knowledge religion laws want of sense and spirit such untimely growth of genius would not have been valued or encouraged by the wise men of antiquity whose sentiments on this point are so ill suited to the genius of our times that it is to be feared modern ears could not bear them but however ridiculous such maxims might seem to our british youth who are so capable and so forward to try experiments and mend the constitution of their country i believe it will be admitted by men of sense that if the governing part of mankind would in these days for experiments sake consider themselves in that old homerical light as pastors of the people whose duty it was to improve their flock they would soon find that this is to be done by an education very different from the modern and otherguess maxims than those of the minute philosophy if our youth were really inured to thought and reflection and an acquaintance with the excellent writers of antiquity we should soon see that licentious humor vulgarly called freethinking banished from the presence of gentlemen together with ignorance and ill taste which as they are inseparable from vice so men follow vice for the fake of pleasure and fly from virtue through an abhorrence of pain their minds therefore betimes should be formed and accustomed to receive pleasure and pain from proper objects or which is the same thing to have their inclinations and aversions rightly placed  this according to plato and aristotle was the  the right education plato in protag and aristot ethic ad nicom l   c   and l  0 c    and those who in their own minds their health or their fortunes feel the cursed effects of a wrong one would do well to consider they cannot better make amends for what was amiss in themselves than by preventing the same in their posterity while crito was saying this company came in which put an end to our conversation  an essay toward a new theory of vision  first

  proper objects of vision the language of the author of nature     in it there is much admirable and deserving our attention     question proposed concerning the object of geometry   0 at first view we are apt to think visible extension the object of geometry     visible extension shown not to be the object of geometry     words may as well be thought the object of geometry as visible extension     it is proposed to inquire what progress an intelligence that could see but not feel might make in geometry     he cannot understand those parts which relate to solids and their surfaces and lines generated by their section     nor even the elements of plain geometry     the proper objects of sight incapable of being managed as geometrical figures     the opinion of those who hold plain figures to be the immediate objects of sight considered     plains no more the immediate objects of sight than solids     difficult to enter precisely into the thoughts of the abovementioned intelligence an essay toward a new theory of vision i my design is to show the manner wherein we perceive by sight the distance magnitude and situation of objects also to consider the difference there is betwixt the ideas of sight and touch and whether there be any idea common to both senses  ii it is i think agreed by all that distance of it self and immediately cannot be seen for distance being a line directed endwise to the eye it projects only one point in the fund of the eye which point remains invariably the same whether the distance be longer or shorter  iii i find it also acknowledged that the estimate we make of the distance of objects considederably remote is rather an act of judgment grounded on experience than of sense for example when i perceive a great number of intermediate objects such as houses fields rivers and the like which i have experienced to take up a considerable space i thence form a judgment or conclusion that the object i see beyond them is at a great distance again when an object appears faint and small which at a near distance i have experienced to make a vigorous and large appearance i instantly conclude it to be far off and this it is evident is the result of experience without which from the faintness and littleness i should not have inferred any thing concerning the distance of objects  iv but when an object is placed at so near a distance as that the interval between the eyes bears any sensible proportion to it the opinion of speculative men is that the two optic axes the fancy that we see only with one eye at once being exploded concurring at the object do there make an angle by means of which according as it is greater or lesser the object is perceived to be nearer or farther off see what descartes and others have written on this subject   v betwixt which and the foregoing manner of estimating distance there is this remarkable difference that whereas there was no apparent necessary connection between small distance and a large and strong appearance or between great distance and little and faint appearance there appears a very necessary connection between an obtuse angle and near distance and an acute angle and farther distance it does not in the least depend upon experience but may be evidently known by any one before he had experienced it that the nearer the concurrence of the optic axes the greater the angle and the remoter their concurrence is the lesser will be the angle comprehended by them  vi there is another way mentioned by optic writers whereby they will have us judge of those distances in respect of which the breadth of the pupil has any sensible bigness and that is the greater or lesser divergency of the rays which issuing from the visible point do fall on the pupil that point being judged nearest which is seen by most diverging rays and that remoter which is seen by less diverging rays and so on the apparent distance still increasing as the divergency of the rays decreases till at length it becomes infinite when the rays that fall on the pupil are to sense parallel and after this manner it is said we perceive distance when we look only with one eye  vii in this case also it is plain we are not beholding to experience it being a certain necessary truth that the nearer the direct rays falling on the eye approach to parallelism the farther off is the point of their intersection or the visible point from whence they flow  viii now though the accounts here given of perceiving near distance by sight are received for true and accordingly made use of in determining the apparent places of objects they do nevertheless seem very unsatisfactory and that for these following reasons  ix it is evident that when the mind perceives any idea not immediately and of it self it must be by the means of some other idea thus for instance the passions which are in the mind of another are of themselves to me invisible i may nevertheless perceive them by sight though not immediately yet by means of the colors they produce in the countenance we often see shame or fear in the looks of a man by perceiving the changes of his countenance to red or pale  x moreover it is evident that no idea which is not it self perceived can be the means of perceiving any other idea if i do not perceive the redness or paleness of a mans face themselves it is impossible i should perceive by them the passions which are in his mind  xi now from sect ii it is plain that distance is in its own nature imperceptible and yet it is perceived by sight it remains therefore that it be brought into view by means of some other idea that is it self immediately perceived in the act of vision  xii but those lines and angles by means whereof some men pretend to explain the perception of distance are themselves not at all perceived nor are they in truth ever thought of by those unskilful in optics i appeal to any ones experience whether upon sight of an object he computes its distance by the bigness of the angle made by the meeting of the two optic axes or whether he ever thinks of the greater or lesser divergency of the rays which arrive from any point to his pupil every one is himself the best judge of what he perceives and what not in vain shall any man tell me that i perceive certain lines and angles which introduce into my mind the various ideas of distance so long as i my self am conscious of no such thing  xiii since therefore those angles and lines are not themselves perceived by sight it follows from sect x that the mind does not by them judge of the distance of objects  xiv the truth of this assertion will be yet farther evident to any one that considers those lines and angles have no real existence in nature being only an hypothesis framed by the mathematicians and by them introduced into optics that they might treat of that science in a geometrical way  xv the last reason i shall give for rejecting that doctrine is that though we should grant the real existence of those optic angles etc and that it was possible for the mind to perceive them yet these principles would not be found sufficient to explain the phoenomena of distance as shall be shown hereafter  xvi now it being already shown that distance is suggested to the mind by the mediation of some other idea which is it self perceived in the act of seeing it remains that we inquire what ideas or sensations there be that attend vision unto which we may suppose the ideas of distance are connected and by which they are introduced into the mind and first it is certain by experience that when we look at a near object with both eyes according as it approaches or recedes from us we alter the disposition of our eyes by lessening or widening the interval between the pupils this disposition or turn of the eyes is attended with a sensation which seems to me to be that which in this case brings the idea of greater or lesser distance into the mind  xvii not that there is any natural or necessary connection between the sensation we perceive by the turn of the eyes and greater or lesser distance but because the mind has by constant experience found the different sensations corresponding to the different dispositions of the eyes to be attended each with a different degree of distance in the object there has grown an habitual or customary connection between those two sorts of ideas so that the mind no sooner perceives the sensation arising from the different turn it gives the eyes in order to bring the pupils nearer or farther asunder but it withal perceives the different idea of distance which was wont to be connected with that sensation just as upon hearing a certain sound the idea is immediately suggested to the understanding which custom had united with it  xviii nor do i see how i can easily be mistaken in this matter i know evidently that distance is not perceived of it self that by consequence it must be perceived by means of some other idea which is immediately perceived and varies with the different degrees of distance i know also that the sensation arising from the turn of the eyes is of it self immediately perceived and various degrees thereof are connected with different distances which never fail to accompany them into my mind when i view an object distinctly with both eyes whose distance is so small that in respect of it the interval between the eyes has any considerable magnitude  xix i know it is a received opinion that by altering the disposition of the eyes the mind perceives whether the angle of the optic axes or the lateral angles comprehended between the interval of the eyes and the optic axes are made greater or lesser and that accordingly by a kind of natural geometry it judges the point of their intersection to be nearer or farther off but that this is not true i am convinced by my own experience since i am not conscious that i make any such use of the perception i have by the turn of my eyes and for me to make those judgments and draw those conclusions from it without knowing that i do so seems altogether incomprehensible  xx from all which it follows that the judgment we make of the distance of an object viewed with both eyes is entirely the result of experience if we had not constantly found certain sensations arising from the various disposition of the eyes attended with certain degrees of distance we should never make those sudden judgments from them concerning the distance of objects no more than we would pretend to judge of a mans thoughts by his pronouncing words we had never heard before  xxi secondly an object placed at a certain distance from the eye to which the breadth of the pupil bears a considerable proportion being made to approach is seen more confusedly and the nearer it is brought the more confused appearance it makes and this being found constantly to be so there arises in the mind an habitual connection between the several degrees of confusion and distance the greater confusion still employing the lesser distance and the lesser confusion the greater distance of the object  xxii this confused appearance of the object does therefore seem to be the medium whereby the mind judges of distance in those cases wherein the most approved writers of optics will have it judge by the different divergency with which the rays flowing from the radiating point fall on the pupil no man i believe will pretend to see or feel those imaginary angles that the rays are supposed to form according to their various inclinations on his eye but he cannot choose seeing whether the object appear more or less confused it is therefore a manifest consequence from what has been demonstrated that instead of the greater or lesser divergency of the rays the mind makes use of the greater or lesser confusedness of the appearance thereby to determine the apparent place of an object  xxiii nor does it avail to say there is not any necessary connection between confused vision and distance great or small for i ask any man what necessary connection he sees between the redness of a blush and shame and yet no sooner shall he behold that color to arise in the face of another but it brings into his mind the idea of that passion which has been observed to accompany it  xxiv what seems to have misled the writers of optics in this matter is that they imagine men judge of distance as they do of a conclusion in mathematics betwixt which and the premises it is indeed absolutely requisite there be an apparent necessary connection but it is far otherwise in the sudden judgments men make of distance we are not to think that brutes and children or even grown reasonable men whenever they perceive an object to approach or depart from them do it by virtue of geometry and demonstration  xxv that one idea may suggest another to the mind it will suffice that they have been observed to go together without any demonstration of the necessity of their coexistence or without so much as knowing what it is that makes them so to coexist of this there are innumerable instances of which no one can be ignorant  xxvi thus greater confusion having been constantly attended with nearer distance no sooner is the former idea perceived but it suggests the latter to our thoughts and if it had been the ordinary course of nature that the farther off an object were placed the more confused it should appear it is certain the very same perception that now makes us think an object approaches would then have made us to imagine it went farther off that perception abstracting from custom and experience being equally fitted to produce the idea of great distance or small distance or no distance at all  xxvii thirdly an object being placed at the distance above specified and brought nearer to the eye we may nevertheless prevent at least for some time the appearances growing more confused by straining the eye in which case that sensation supplys the place of confused vision in aiding the mind to judge of the distance of the object it being esteemed so much the nearer by how much the effort or straining of the eye in order to distinct vision is greater  xxviii i have here set down those sensations or ideas that seem to be the constant and general occasions of introducing into the mind the different ideas of near distance it is true in most cases that diverse other circumstances contribute to frame our idea of distance to wit the particular number size kind etc of the things seen concerning which as well as all other the forementioned occasions which suggest distance i shall only observe they have none of them in their own nature any relation or connection with it nor is it possible they should ever signify the various degrees thereof otherwise than as by experience they have been found to be connected with them  xxix i shall proceed upon these principles to account for a phenomenon which has hitherto strangely puzzled the writers of optics and is so far from being accounted for by any of their theories of vision that it is by their own confession plainly repugnant to them and of consequence if nothing else could be objected were alone sufficient to bring their credit in question the whole difficulty i shall lay before you in the words of the learned dr barrow with which he concludes his optic lectures  haec sunt quae circa pantem opticae praecipue

vobis itaque nodum hunc utinam feliciore conatu resolvendum committo  in english as follows  i have here delivered what my thoughts have suggested to me concerning that part of optics which is more properly mathematical as for the other parts of that science which being rather physical do consequently abound with plausible conjectures instead of certain principles there has in them scarce any thing occurred to my observation different from what has been already said by kepler scheinerus descartes and others and methinks i had better say nothing at all than repeat that which has been so often said by others i think it therefore high time to take my leave of this subject but before i quit it for good and all the fair and ingenuous dealing that i owe both to you and to truth obliges me to acquaint you with a certain untoward difficulty which seems directly opposite to the doctrine i have been hitherto inculcating at least admits of no solution from it in short it is this before the double unequal glass or concave speculum e b f let the point a be placed at such a distance that the rays proceeding from a after refraction or reflection be brought to unite somewhere in the ax a b and suppose the point of union i e the image of the point a as has been already set forth to be z between which and b the vertex of the glass or speculum conceive the eye to be any where placed the question now is where the point a ought to appear experience shows that it does not appear behind at the point z and it were contrary to nature that it should since all the impression which affects the sense comes from toward a but from our tenets it should seem to follow that it would appear before the eye at a vast distance off so great as should in some sort surpass all sensible distance for since if we exclude all anticipations and prejudices every object appears by so much the farther off by how much the rays it sends to the eye are less diverging and that object is thought to be most remote from which parallel rays proceed unto the eye reason would make one think that object should appear at yet a greater distance which is seen by converging rays moreover it may in general be asked concerning this case what it is that determines the apparent place of the point a and makes it to appear after a constant manner sometimes nearer at other times farther off to which doubt i see nothing that can be answered agreeable to the principles we have laid down except only that the point a ought always to appear extremely remote but on the contrary we are assured by experience that the point a appears variously distant according to the different situations of the eye between the points b and z and that it does almost never if at all seem farther off than it would if it were beheld by the naked eye but on the contrary it does sometimes appear much nearer nay it is even certain that by how much the rays falling on the eye do more converge by so much the nearer does the object seem to approach for the eye being placed close to the point b the object a appears nearly in its own natural place if the point b is taken in the glass or at the same distance if in the speculum the eye being brought back to o the object seems to draw near and being come to p it beholds it still nearer and so on by little and little till at length the eye being placed somewhere suppose at q the object appearing extremely near begins to vanish into mere confusion all which does seem repugnant to our principles at least not rightly to agree with them nor is our tenet alone struck at by this experiment but likewise all others that ever came to my knowledge are every whit as much endangered by it the ancient one especially which is most commonly received and comes nearest to mine seems to be so effectually overthrown thereby that the most learned tacquet has been forced to reject that principle as false and uncertain on which alone he had built almost his whole catoptrics and consequently by taking away the foundation has himself pulled down the superstructure he had raised on it which nevertheless i do not believe he would have done had he but considered the whole matter more thoroughly and examined the difficulty to the bottom but as for me neither this nor any other difficulty shall have so great an influence on me as to make me renounce that which i know to be manifestly agreeable to reason especially when as it here falls out the difficulty is founded in the peculiar nature of a certain odd and particular case for in the present case something peculiar lies hid which being involved in the subtilty of nature will perhaps hardly be discovered till such time as the manner of vision is more perfectly made known concerning which i must own i have hitherto been able to find out nothing that has the least show of probability not to mention certainty i shall therefore leave this knot to be untied by you wishing you may have better success in it than i have had  xxx the ancient and received principle which dr barrow here mentions as the main foundation of tacquets catoptrics is that every visible point seen by reflection from a speculum shall appear placed at the intersection of the reflected ray and the perpendicular of incidence which intersection in the present case happening to be behind the eye it greatly shakes the authority of that principle where on the aforementioned author proceeds throughout his whole catoptrics in determining the apparent place of objects seen by reflection from any kind of speculum  xxxi let us now see how this phenomenon agrees with our tenets the eye the nearer it is placed to the point b in the foregoing figures the more distinct is the appearance of the object but as it recedes to o the appearance grows more confused and at p it sees the object yet more confused and so on till the eye being brought back to z sees the object in the greatest confusion of all wherefore by sect xxi the object should seem to approach the eye gradually as it recedes from the point b that is at o it should in consequence of the principle i have laid down in the aforesaid section seem nearer than it did at b and at p nearer than at o and at q nearer than at p and so on till it quite vanishes at z which is the very matter of fact as any one that pleases may easily satisfy himself by experiment  xxxii this case is much the same as if we should suppose an englishman to meet a foreigner who used the same words with the english but in a direct contrary signification the englishman would not fail to make a wrong judgment of the ideas annexed to those sounds in the mind of him that used them just so in the present case the object speaks if i may so say with words that the eye is well acquainted with that is confusions of appearance but whereas heretofore the greater confusions were always wont to signify nearer distances they have in this case a direct contrary signification being connected with the greater distances whence it follows that the eye must unavoidably be mistaken since it will take the confusions in the sense it has been used to which is directly opposed to the true  xxxiii this phenomenon as it entirely subverts the opinion of those who will have us judge of distance by lines and angles on which supposition it is altogether inexplicable so it seems to me no small confirmation of the truth of that principle whereby it is explained but in order to a more full explication of this point and to show how far the hypothesis of the minds judging by the various divergency of rays may be of use in determining the apparent place of an object it will be necessary to premise some few things which are already well known to those who have any skill in dioptrics  xxxiv first any radiating point is then distinctly seen when the rays proceeding from it are by the refractive power of the crystalline accurately reunited in the retina or fund of the eye but if they are reunited either before they arrive at the retina or after they have past it then there is confused vision  xxxv secondly suppose in the adjacent figures np represent an eye duly framed and retaining fig   fig   fig   its natural figure in fig   the rays falling nearly parallel on the eye are by the crystalline ab refracted so as their focus or point of union f falls exactly on the retina but if the rays fall sensibly diverging on the eye as in fig   then their focus falls beyond the retina or if the rays are made to converge by the lens qs before they come at the eye as in fig   their focus f will fall before the retina in which two last cases it is evident from the foregoing section that the appearance of the point z is confused and by how much the greater is the convergency or divergency of the rays falling on the pupil by so much the farther will the point of their reunion be from the retina either before or behind it and consequently the point z will appear by so much the more confused and this by the bye may show us the difference between confused and faint vision confused vision is when the rays proceeding from each distinct point of the object are not accurately recollected in one corresponding point on the retina but take up some space thereon so that rays from different points become mixed and confused together this is opposed to a distinct vision and attends near objects faint vision is when by reason of the distance of the object or grossness of the interjacent medium few rays arrive from the object to the eye this is opposed to vigorous or clear vision and attends remote objects but to return  xxxvi the eye or to speak truly the mind perceiving only the confusion it self without ever considering the cause from which it proceeds does constantly annex the same degree of distance to the same degree of confusion whether that confusion be occasioned by converging or by diverging rays it matters not whence it follows that the eye viewing the object z through the glass qs which by refraction causes the rays zq zs etc to converge should judge it to be at such a nearness at which if it were placed it would radiate on the eye with rays diverging to that degree as would produce the same confusion which is now produced by converging rays i e would cover a portion of the retina equal to dc vid fig   supra but then this must be understood to use dr barrows phrase seclusis praenotionibus and praejudiciis in case we abstract from all other circumstances of vision such as the figure size faintness etc of the visible objects all which do ordinarily concur to form our idea of distance the mind having by frequent experience observed their several sorts or degrees to be connected with various distances  xxxvii it plainly follows from what has been said that a person perfectly purblind i e that could not see an object distinctly but when placed close to his eye would not make the same wrong judgment that others do in the forementioned case for to him greater confusions constantly suggesting greater distances he must as he recedes from the glass and the object grows more confused judge it to be at a farther distance contrary to what they do who have had the perception of the objects growing more confused connected with the idea of approach  xxxviii hence also it does appear there may be good use of computation by lines and angles in optics not that the mind judges of distance immediately by them but because it judges by somewhat which is connected with them and to the determination whereof they may be subservient thus the mind judging of the distance of an object by the confusedness of its appearance and this confusedness being greater or lesser to the naked eye according as the object is seen by rays more or less diverging it follows that a man may make use of the divergency of the rays in computing the apparent distance though not for its own sake yet on account of the confusion with which it is connected but so it is the confusion it self is entirely neglected by mathematicians as having no necessary relation with distance such as the greater or lesser angles of divergency are conceived to have and these especially for that they fall under mathematical computation are alone regarded in determining the apparent places of objects as though they were the sole and immediate cause of the judgments the mind makes of distance whereas in truth they should not at all be regarded in themselves or any otherwise than as they are supposed to be the cause of confused vision  xxxix the not considering of this has been a fundamental and perplexing oversight for proof whereof we need go no farther than the case before us it having been observed that the most diverging rays brought into the mind the idea of nearest distance and that still as the divergency decreased the distance increased and it being thought the connection between the various degrees of divergency and distance was immediate this naturally leads one to conclude from an ill grounded analogy that converging rays shall make an object appear at an immense distance and that as the convergency increases the distance if it were possible should do so likewise that this was the cause of dr barrows mistake is evident from his own words which we have quoted whereas had the learned doctor observed that diverging and converging rays how opposite soever they may seem do nevertheless agree in producing the same effect to wit confusedness of vision greater degrees whereof are produced indifferently either as the divergency or convergency of the rays increases and that it is by this effect which is the same in both that either the divergency or convergency is perceived by the eye i say had he but considered this it is certain he would have made a quite contrary judgment and rightly concluded that those rays which fall on the eye with greater degrees of convergency should make the object from whence they proceed appear by so much the nearer but it is plain it was impossible for any man to attain to a right notion of this matter so long as he had regard only to lines and angles and did not apprehend the true nature of vision and how far it was of mathematical consideration  xl before we dismiss this subject it is fit we take notice of a query relating thereto proposed by the ingenious mr molyneux in his treatise of dioptrics par i prop    sect    where speaking of this difficulty he has these words and so he i e dr barrow leaves this difficulty to the solution of others which i after so great an example shall do likewise but with the resolution of the same admirable author of not quitting the evident doctrine which we have before laid down for determining the locus objecti on account of being pressed by one difficulty which seems inexplicable till a more intimate knowledge of the visive faculty be obtained by mortals in the mean time i propose it to the consideration of the ingenious whether the locus apparens of an object placed as in this  th section be not as much before the eye as the distinct base is behind the eye to which query we may venture to answer in the negative for in the present case the rule for determining the distance of the distinct base or respective focus from the glass is this as the difference between the distance of the object and focus is to the focus or focal length so the distance of the object from the glass is to the distance of the respective focus or distinct base from the glass molyneux dioptr par i prop    let us now suppose the object to be placed at the distance of the focal length and one half of the focal length from the glass and the eye close to the glass hence it will follow by the rule that the distance of the distinct base behind the eye is double the true distance of the object before the eye if therefore mr molyneuxs conjecture held good it would follow that the eye should see the object twice as far off as it really is and in other cases at three or four times its due distance or more but this manifestly contradicts experience the object never appearing at farthest beyond its due distance what ever therefore is built on this supposition vid corol   prop    ibid comes to the ground along with it  xli from what has been premised it is a manifest consequence that a man born blind being made to see would at first have no idea of distance by sight the sun and stars the remotest objects as well as the nearer would all seem to be in his eye or rather in his mind the objects intromitted by sight would seem to him as in truth they are no other than a new set of thoughts or sensations each whereof is as near to him as the perceptions of pain or pleasure or the most inward passions of his soul for our judging objects perceived by sight to be at any distance or without the mind is vid sect xxviii entirely the effect of experience which one in those circumstances could not yet have attained to  xlii it is indeed otherwise upon the common supposition that men judge of distance by the angle of the optic axes just as one in the dark or a blindman by the angle comprehended by two sticks one whereof he held in each hand for if this were true it would follow that one blind from his birth being made to see should stand in need of no new experience in order to perceive distance by sight but that this is false has i think been sufficiently demonstrated  xliii and perhaps upon a strict inquiry we shall not find that even those who from their birth have grown up in a continued habit of seeing are irrecoverably prejudiced on the other side to wit in thinking what they see to be at a distance from them for at this time it seems agreed on all hands by those who have had any thoughts of that matter that colors which are the proper and immediate object of sight are not without the mind but then it will be said by sight we have also the ideas of extension and figure and motion all which may well be thought without and at some distance from the mind though color should not in answer to this i appeal to any mans experience whether the visible extension of any object does not appear as near to him as the color of that object nay whether they do not both seem to be in the very same place is not the extension we see colored and is it possible for us so much as in thought to separate and abstract color from extension now where the extension is there surely is the figure and there the motion too i speak of those which are perceived by sight  xliv but for a fuller explication of this point and to show that the immediate objects of sight are not so much as the ideas or resemblances of things placed at a distance it is requisite that we look nearer into the matter and carefully observe what is meant in common discourse when one says that which he sees is at a distance from him suppose for example that looking at the moon i should say it were fifty or sixty semidiameters of the earth distant from me let us see what moon this is spoken of it is plain it cannot be the visible moon or any thing like the visible moon or that which i see which is only a round luminous plain of about thirty visible points in diameter for in case i am carried from the place where i stand directly toward the moon it is manifest the object varies still as i go on and by the time that i am advanced fifty or sixty semidiameters of the earth i shall be so far from being near a small round luminous flat that i shall perceive nothing like it this object having long since disappeared and if i would recover it it must be by going back to the earth from whence i set out again suppose i perceive by sight the faint and obscure idea of something which i doubt whether it be a man or a tree or a tower but judge it to be at the distance of about a mile it is plain i cannot mean that what i see is a mile off or that it is the image or likeness of any thing which is a mile off since that every step i take toward it the appearance alters and from being obscure small and faint grows clear large and vigorous and when i come to the miles end that which i saw first is quite lost neither do i find any thing in the likeness of it  xlv in these and the like instances the truth of the matter stands thus having of a long time experienced certain ideas perceivable by touch as distance tangible figure and solidity to have been connected with certain ideas of sight i do upon perceiving these ideas of sight forthwith conclude what tangible ideas are by the wonted ordinary course of nature like to follow looking at an object i perceive a certain visible figure and color with some degree of faintness and other circumstances which from what i have formerly observed determine me to think that if i advance forward so many paces or miles i shall be affected with such and such ideas of touch so that in truth and strictness of speech i neither see distance it self nor any thing that i take to be at a distance i say neither distance nor things placed at a distance are themselves or their ideas truly perceived by sight this i am persuaded of as to what concerns my self and i believe whoever will look narrowly into his own thoughts and examine what he means by saying he sees this or that thing at a distance will agree with me that what he sees only suggests to his understanding that after having passed a certain distance to be measured by the motion of his body which is perceivable by touch he shall come to perceive such and such tangible ideas which have been usually connected with such and such visible ideas but that one might be deceived by these suggestions of sense and that there is no necessary connection between visible and tangible ideas suggested by them we need go no farther than the next lookingglass or picture to be convinced note that when i speak of tangible ideas i take the word idea for any the immediate object of sense or understanding in which large signification it is commonly used by the moderns  xlvi from what we have shown it is a manifest consequence that the ideas of space outness and things placed at a distance are not strictly speaking the object of sight they are not otherwise perceived by the eye than by the ear sitting in my study i hear a coach drive along the street i look through the casement and see it i walk out and enter into it thus common speech would incline one to think i heard saw and touched the same thing to wit the coach it is nevertheless certain the ideas intromitted by each sense are widely different and distinct from each other but having been observed constantly to go together they are spoken of as one and the same thing by the variation of the noise i perceive the different distances of the coach and know that it approaches before i look out thus by the ear i perceive distance just after the same manner as i do by the eye  xlvii i do not nevertheless say i hear distance in like manner as i say that i see it the ideas perceived by hearing not being so apt to be confounded with the ideas of touch as those of sight are so likewise a man is easily convinced that bodies and external things are not properly the object of hearing but only sounds by the mediation whereof the idea of this or that body or distance is suggested to his thoughts but then one is with more difficulty brought to discern the difference there is betwixt the ideas of sight and touch though it be certain a man no more sees or feels the same thing than he hears and feels the same thing  xlviii one reason of which seems to be this it is thought a great absurdity to imagine that one and the same thing should have any more than one extension and one figure but the extension and figure of a body being let into the mind two ways and that indifferently either by sight or touch it seems to follow that we see the same extension and the same figure which we feel  xlix but if we take a close and accurate view of things it must be acknowledged that we never see and feel one and the same object that which is seen is one thing and that which is felt is another if the visible figure and extension be not the same with the tangible figure and extension we are not to infer that one and the same thing has diverse extensions the true consequence is that the objects of sight and touch are two distinct things it may perhaps require some thought rightly to conceive this distinction and the difficulty seems not a little increased because the combination of visible ideas has constantly the same name as the combination of tangible ideas wherewith it is connected which does of necessity arise from the use and end of language  l in order therefore to treat accurately and unconfusedly of vision we must bear in mind that there are two sorts of objects apprehended by the eye the one primarily and immediately the other secondarily and by intervention of the former those of the first sort neither are nor appear to be without the mind or at any distance off they may indeed grow greater or smaller more confused or more clear or more faint but they do not cannot appraoch or recede from us whenever we say an object is at a distance whenever we say it draws near or goes farther off we must always mean it of the latter sort which properly belong to the touch and are not so truly perceived as suggested by the eye in like manner as thoughts by the ear  li no sooner do we hear the words of a familiar language pronounced in our ears but the ideas corresponding thereto present themselves to our minds in the very same instant the sound and the meaning enter the understanding so closely are they united that it is not in our power to keep out the one except we exclude the other also we even act in all respects as if we heard the very thoughts themselves so likewise the secondary objects or those which are only suggested by sight do often more strongly affect us and are more regarded than the proper objects of that sense along with which they enter into the mind and with which they have a far more strict connection than ideas have with words hence it is we find it so difficult to discriminate between the immediate and mediate objects of sight and are so prone to attribute to the former what belongs only to the latter they are as it were most closely twisted blended and incorporated together and the prejudice is confirmed and riveted in our thoughts by a long tract of time by the use of language and want of reflection however i believe any one that shall attentively consider what we have already said and shall say upon this subject before we have done especially if he pursue it in his own thoughts may be able to deliver himself from that prejudice sure i am it is worth some attention to whoever would understand the true nature of vision  lii i have now done with distance and proceed to show how it is that we perceive by sight the magnitude of objects it is the opinion of some that we do it by angles or by angles in conjunction with distance but neither angles nor distance being perceivable by sight and the things we see being in truth at no distance from us it follows that as we have shown lines and angles not to be the medium the mind makes use of in apprehending the apparent place so neither are they the medium whereby it apprehends the apparent magnitude of objects  liii it is well known that the same extension at a near distance shall subtend a greater angle and at a farther distance a lesser angle and by this principle we are told the mind estimates the magnitude of an object comparing the angle under which it is seen with its distance and thence inferring the magnitude thereof what inclines men to this mistake beside the humor of making one see by geometry is that the same perceptions or ideas which suggest distance do also suggest magnitude but if we examine it we shall find they suggest the latter as immediately as the former i say they do not first suggest distance and then leave it to the judgment to use that as a medium whereby to collect the magnitude but they have as close and immediate a connection with the magnitude as with the distance and suggest magnitude as independently of distance as they do distance independently of magnitude all which will be evident to whoever considers what has been already said and what follows  live it has been shown there are two sorts of objects apprehended by sight each whereof has its distinct magnitude or extension the one properly tangible i e to be perceived and measured by touch and not immediately falling under the sense of seeing the other properly and immediately visible by mediation of which the former is brought in view each of these magnitudes are greater or lesser according as they contain in them more or fewer points they being made up of points or minimums for whatever may be said of extension in abstract it is certain sensible extension is not infinitely divisible there is a minimum tangibile and a minimum visibile beyond which sense cannot perceive this every ones experience will inform him  lv the magnitude of the object which exists without the mind and is at a distance continues always invariably the same but the visible object still changing as you approach to or recede from the tangible object it has no fixed and determinate greatness whenever therefore we speak of the magnitude of any thing for instance a tree or a house we must mean the tangible magnitude otherwise there can be nothing steady and free from ambiguity spoken of it but though the tangible and visible magnitude in truth belong to two distinct objects i shall nevertheless especially since those objects are called by the same name and are observed to coexist to avoid tediousness and singularity of speech sometimes speak of them as belonging to one and the same thing  lvi now in order to discover by what means the magnitude of tangible objects is perceived by sight i need only reflect on what passes in my own mind and observe what those things be which introduce the ideas of greater or lesser into my thoughts when i look on any object and these i find to be first the magnitude or extension of the visible object which being immediately perceived by sight is connected with that other which is tangible and placed at a distance secondly the confusion or distinctness and thirdly the vigorousness or faintness of the aforesaid visible appearance caeteris paribus by how much the greater or lesser the visible object is by so much the greater or lesser do i conclude the tangible object to be but be the idea immediately perceived by sight never so large yet if it be withal confused i judge the magnitude of the thing to be but small if it be distinct and clear i judge it greater and if it be faint i apprehend it to be yet greater what is here meant by confusion and faintness has been explained in sect xxxv  lvii moreover the judgments we make of greatness do in like manner as those of distance depend on the disposition of the eye also on the figure number and situation of objects and other circumstances that have been observed to attend great or small tangible magnitudes thus for instance the very same quantity of visible extension which in the figure of a tower does suggest the idea of great magnitude shall in the figure of a man suggest the idea of much smaller magnitude that this is owing to the experience we have had of the usual bigness of a tower and a man no one i suppose need be told  lviii it is also evident that confusion or faintness have no more a necessary connection with little or great magnitude than they have with little or great distance as they suggest the latter so they suggest the former to our minds and by consequence if it were not for experience we should no more judge a faint or confused appearance to be connected with great or little magnitude than we should that it was connected with great or little distance  lix nor will it be found that great or small visible magnitude has any necessary relation to great or small tangible magnitude so that the one may certainly be inferred from the other but before we come to the proof of this it is fit we consider the difference there is betwixt the extension and figure which is the proper object of touch and that other which is termed visible and how the former is principally though not immediately taken notice of when we look at any object this has been before mentioned but we shall here inquire into the cause thereof we regard the objects that environ us in proportion as they are adapted to benefit or injure our own bodies and thereby produce in our minds the sensations of pleasure or pain now bodies operating on our organs by an immediate application and the hurt or advantage arising therefrom depending altogether on the tangible and not at all on the visible qualities of any object this is a plain reason why those should be regarded by us much more than these and for this end the visive sense seems to have been bestowed on animals to wit that by the perception of visible ideas which in themselves are not capable of affecting or any wise altering the frame of their bodies they may be able to foresee from the experience they have had what tangible ideas are connected with such and such visible ideas the damage or benefit which is like to ensue upon the application of their own bodies to this or that body which is at a distance which foresight how necessary it is to the preservation of an animal every ones experience can inform him hence it is that when we look at an object the tangible figure and extension thereof are principally attended to whilst there is small heed taken of the visible figure and magnitude which though more immediately perceived do less concern us and are not fitted to pruduce any alteration in our bodies  lx that the matter of fact is true will be evident to any one who considers that a man placed at ten foot distance is thought as great as if he were placed at the distance only of five foot which is true not with relation to the visible but tangible greatness of the object the visible magnitude being far greater at one station than it is at the other  lxi inches feet etc are settled stated lengths whereby we measure objects and estimate their magnitude we say for example an object appears to be six inches or six foot long now that this cannot be meant of visible inches etc is evident because a visible inch is it self no constant determinate magnitude and cannot therefore serve to mark out and determine the magnitude of any other thing take an inch marked upon a ruler view it successively at the distance of half a foot a foot a foot and a half etc from the eye at each of which and at all the intermediate distances the inch shall have a different visible extension i e there shall be more or fewer points discerned in it now i ask which of all these various extensions is that stated determinate one that is agreed on for a common measure of other magnitudes no reason can be assigned why we should pitch on one more than another and except there be some invariable determinate extension fixed on to be marked by the word inch it is plain it can be used to little purpose and to say a thing contains this or that number of inches shall imply no more than that it is extended without bringing any particular idea of that extension into the mind farther an inch and a foot from different distances shall both exhibit the same visible magnitude and yet at the same time you shall say that one seems several times greater than the other from all which it is manifest that the judgments we make of the magnitude of objects by sight are altogether in reference to their tangible extension whenever we say an object is great or small of this or that determinate measure i say it must be meant of the tangible and not the visible extension which though immediately perceived is nevertheless little taken notice of  lxii now that there is no necessary connection between these two distinct extensions is evident from hence because our eyes might have been framed in such a manner as to be able to see nothing but what were less than the minimum tangibile in which case it is not impossible we might have perceived all the immediate objects of sight the very same that we do now but unto those visible appearances there would not be connected those different tangible magnitudes that are now which shows the judgments we make of the magnitude of things placed at a distance from the various greatness of the immediate objects of sight do not arise from any essential or necessary but only a customary tie which has been observed between them  lxiii moreover it is not only certain that any idea of sight might not have been connected with this or that idea of touch which we now observe to accompany it but also that the greater visible magnitudes might have been connected with and introduced into our minds lesser tangible magnitudes and the lesser visible magnitudes greater tangible magnitudes nay that it actually is so we have daily experience that object which makes a strong and large appearance not seeming near so great as another the visible magnitude whereof is much less but more faint and the appearance upper or which is the same thing painted lower on the retina which faintness and situation suggest both greater magnitude and greater distance  lxiv from which and from sect lvii and lviii it is manifest that as we do not perceive the magnitudes of objects immediately by sight so neither do we perceive them by the mediation of any thing which has a necessary connection with them those ideas that now suggest unto us the various magnitudes of external objects before we touch them might possibly have suggested no such thing or they might have signified them in a direct contrary manner so that the very same ideas on the perception whereof we judge an object to be small might as well have served to make us conclude it great those ideas being in their own nature equally fitted to bring into our minds the idea of small or great or no size at all of outward objects just as the words of any language are in their own nature indifferent to signify this or that thing or nothing at all  lxv as we see distance so we see magnitude and we see both in the same way that we see shame or anger in looks of a man those passions are themselves invisible they are nevertheless let in by the eye along with colors and alterations of countenance which are the immediate object of vision and which signify them for no other reason than barely because they have been observed to accompany them without which experience we should no more have taken blushing for a sign of shame than of gladness  lxvi we are nevertheless exceeding prone to imagine those things which are perceived only by the mediation of others to be themselves the immediate objects of sight or at least to have in their own nature a fitness to be suggested by them before ever they had been experienced to coexist with them from which prejudice every one perhaps will not find it easy to emancipate himself by any the clearest convictions of reason and there are some grounds to think that if there was one only invariable and universal language in the world and that men were born with the faculty of speaking it it would be the opinion of many that the ideas in other mens minds were properly perceived by the ear or had at least a necessary and inseparable tie with the sounds that were affixed to them all which seems to arise from want of a due application of our discerning faculty thereby to discriminate between the ideas that are in our understandings and consider them apart from each other which would preserve us from confounding those that are different and make us fee what ideas do and what do not include or imply this or that other idea  lxvii there is a celebrated phenomenon the solution whereof i shall attempt to give by the principles that have been laid down in reference to the manner wherein we apprehend by sight the magnitude of objects the apparent magnitude of the moon when placed in the horizon is much greater than when it is in the meridian though the angle under which the diameter of the moon is seen be not observed greater in the former case than in the latter and the horizontal moon does not constantly appear of the same bigness but at some times seems far greater than at others  lxviii now in order to explain the reason of the moons appearing greater than ordinary in the horizon it must be observed that the particles which compose our atmosphere intercept the rays of light proceeding from any object to the eye and by how much the greater is the portion of atmosphere interjacent between the object and the eye by so much the more are the rays intercepted and by consequence the appearance of the object rendered more faint every object appearing more vigorous or more faint in proportion as it sends more or fewer rays into the eye now between the eye and the moon when situated in the horizon there lies a far greater quantity of atmosphere than there does when the moon is in the meridian whence it comes to pass that the appearance of the horizontal moon is fainter and therefore by sect lvi it should be thought bigger in that situation than in the meridian or in any other elevation above the horizon  lxix farther the air being variously impregnated sometimes more and sometimes less with vapors and exhalations fitted to retund and intercept the rays of light it follows that the appearance of the horizontal moon has not always an equal faintness and by consequence that luminary though in the very same situation is at one time judged greater than at another  lxx that we have here given the true account of the phenomenon of the horizontal moon will i suppose be farther evident to any one from the following considerations first it is plain that which in this case suggests the idea of greater magnitude must be something which is it self perceived for that which is unperceived cannot suggest to our perception any other thing secondly it must be something that does not constantly remain the same but is subject to some change or variation since the appearance of the horizontal moon varies being at one time greater than at another and yet thirdly it cannot be the visible figure or magnitude since that remains the same or is rather lesser by how much the moon is nearer to the horizon it remains therefore that the true cause is that affection or alteration of the visible appearance which proceeds from the greater paucity of rays arriving at the eye and which i term faintness since this answers all the forementioned conditions and i am not conscious of any other perception that does  lxxi add to this that in misty weather it is a common observation that the appearance of the horizontal moon is far larger than usual which greatly conspires with and strengthens our opinion neither would it prove in the least irreconcilable with what we have said if the horizontal moon should chance sometimes to seem enlarged beyond its usual extent even in more screne weather for we must not only have regard to the mist which happens to be in the place where we stand we ought also to take into our thoughts the whole sum of vapors and exhalations which lie betwixt the eye and the moon all which cooperating to render the appearance of the moon more faint and thereby increase its magnitude it may chance to appear greater than it usually does even in the horizontal position at a time when though there be no extraordinary fog or haziness just in the place where we stand yet the air between the eye and the moon taken altogether may be loaded with a greater quantity of interspersed vapors and exhalations than at other times  lxxii it may be objected that in consequence of our principles the interposition of a body in some degree opaque which may intercept a great part of the rays of light should render the appearance of the moon in the meridian as large as when it is viewed in the horizon to which i answer it is not faintness any how applied that suggests greater magnitude there being no necessary but only an experimental connection between those two things it follows that the faintness which enlarges the appearance must be applied in such sort and with such circumstances as have been observed to attend the vision of great magnitudes when from a distance we behold great objects the particles of the intermediate air and vapors which are themselves unperceivable do interrupt the rays of light and thereby render the appearance less strong and vivid now faintness of appearance caused in this sort has been experienced to coexist with great magnitude but when it is caused by the interposition of an opaque sensible body this circumstance alters the case so that a faint appearance this way caused does not suggest greater magnitude because it has not been experienced to coexist with it  lxxiii faintness as well as all other ideas or perceptions which suggest magnitude or distance does it in the same way that words suggest the notions to which they are annexed now it is known a word pronounced with certain circumstances or in a certain context with other words has not always the same import and signification that it has when pronounced in some other circumstances or different context of words the very same visible appearance as to faintness and all other respects if placed on high shall not suggest the same magnitude that it would if it were seen at an equal distance on a level with the eye the reason whereof is that we are rarely accustomed to view objects at a great height our concerns lie among things situated rather before than above us and accordingly our eyes are not placed on the top of our heads but in such a position as is most convenient for us to see distant objects standing in our way and this situation of them being a circumstance which usually attends the vision of distant objects we may from hence account for what is commonly observed an objects appearing of different magnitude even with respect to its horizontal extension on the top of a steeple for example an hundred feet high to one standing below from what it would if placed at an hundred feet distance on a level with his eye for it has been shown that the judgment we make on the magnitude of a thing depends not on the visible appearance alone but also on diverse other circumstances any one of which being omitted or varied may suffice to make some alteration in our judgment hence the circumstance of viewing a distant object in such a situation as is usual and suits with the ordinary posture of the head and eyes being omitted and instead thereof a different situation of the object which requires a different posture of the head taking place it is not to be wondered at if the magnitude be judged different but it will be demanded why an high object should constantly appear less than an equidistant low object of the same dimensions for so it is observed to be it may indeed be granted that the variation of some circumstances may vary the judgment made on the magnitude of high objects which we are less used to look at but it does not hence appear why they should be judged less rather than greater i answer that in case the magnitude of distant objects was suggested by the extent of their visible appearance alone and thought proportional thereto it is certain they would then be judged much less than now they seem to be vide sect lxxix but several circumstances concurring to form the judgment we make on the magnitude of distant objects by means of which they appear far larger than others whose visible appearance has an equal or even greater extension it follows that upon the change or omission of any of those circumstances which are wont to attend the vision of distant objects and so come to influence the judgments made on their magnitude they shall proportionably appear less than otherwise they would for any of those things that caused an object to be thought greater than in proportion to its visible extension being either omitted or applied without the usual circumstances the judgment depends more entirely on the visible extension and consequently the object must be judged less thus in the present case the situation of the thing seen being different from what it usually is in those objects we have occasion to view and whose magnitude we observe it follows that the very same object being an hundred feet high should seem less than if it was an hundred feet off on or nearly on a level with the eye what has been here set forth seems to me to have no small share in contributing to magnify the appearance of the horizontal moon and deserves not to be passed over in the explication of it  lxxiv if we attentively consider the phenomenon before us we shall find the not discerning between the mediate and immediate objects of sight to be the chief cause of the difficulty that occurs in the explication of it the magnitude of the visible moon or that which is the proper and immediate object of vision is no greater when the moon is in the horizon than when it is in the meridian how comes it therefore to seem greater in one situation than the other what is it can put this cheat on the understanding it has no other perception of the moon than what it gets by sight and that which is seen is of the same extent i say the visible appearance has the same or rather a less magnitude when the moon is viewed in the horizontal than when in the meridional position and yet it is esteemed greater in the former than in the latter herein consists the difficulty which does vanish and admit of a most easy solution if we consider that as the visible moon is not greater in the horizon than in the meridian so neither is it thought to be so it has been already shown that in any act of vision the visible object absolutely or in it self is little taken notice of the mind still carrying its view from that to some tangible ideas which have been observed to be connected with it and by that means come to be suggested by it so that when a thing is said to appear great or small or whatever estimate be made of the magnitude of any thing this is meant not of the visible but of the tangible object this duly considered it will be no hard matter to reconcile the seeming contradiction there is that the moon should appear of a different bigness the visible magnitude thereof remaining still the same for by sect lvi the very same visible extension with a different faintness shall suggest a different tangible extension when therefore the horizontal moon is said to appear greater than the meridional moon this must be understood not of a greater visible extension but of a greater tangible or real extension which by reason of the more than ordinary faintness of the visible appearance is suggested to the mind along with it  lxxv many attempts have been made by learned men to account for this appearance gassendus descartes hobbes and several others have emplowed their thoughts on that subject but how fruitless and unsatisfactory their endeavors have been is sufficiently shown in the philosophical transactions phil trans number     p      where you may see their several opinions at large set forth and confuted not without some surprise at the gross blunders that ingenious men have been forced into by endeavoring to reconcile this appearance with the ordinary principles of optics since the writing of which there has been published in the transactions number     p     another paper relating to the same affair by the celebrated dr wallis wherein he attempts to account for that phenomenon which though it seems not to contain any thing new or different from what had been said before by others i shall nevertheless consider in this place  lxxvi his opinion in short is this we judge not of the magnitude of an object by the visual angle alone but by the visual angle in conjunction with the distance hence though the angle remain the same or even become less yet if withal the distance seem to have been increased the object shall appear greater now one way whereby we estimate the distance of any thing is by the number and extent of the intermediate objects when therefore the moon is seen in the horizon the variety of fields houses etc together with the large prospect of the wide extended land or sea that lies between the eye and the utmost limb of the horizon suggest unto the mind the idea of greater distance and consequently magnify the appearance and this according to dr wallis is the true account of the extraordinary largeness attributed by the mind to the horizontal moon at a time when the angle subtended by its diameter is not one jot greater than it used to be  lxxvii with reference to this opinion not to repeat what has been already said concerning distance i shall only observe first that if the prospect of interjacent objects be that which suggests the idea of farther distance and this idea of farther distance be the cause that brings into the mind the idea of greater magnitude it should hence follow that if one looked at the horizontal moon from behind a wall it would appear no bigger than ordinary for in that case the wall interposing cuts off all that prospect of sea and land etc which might otherwise increase the apparent distance and thereby the apparent magnitude of the moon nor will it suffice to say the memory does even then suggest all that extent of land etc which lies within the horizon which suggestion occasions a sudden judgment of sense that the moon is farther off and larger than usual for ask any man who from such a station beholding the horizontal moon shall think her greater than usual whether he has at that time in his mind any idea of the intermediate objects or long tract of land that lies between his eye and the extreme edge of the horizon and whether it be that idea which is the cause of his making the aforementioned judgment he will i suppose reply in the negative and declare the horizontal moon shall appear greater than the meridional though he never thinks of all or any of those things that lie between him and it secondly it seems impossible by this hypothesis to account for the moons appearing in the very same situation at one time greater than at another which nevertheless has been shown to be very agreeable to the principles we have laid down and receives a most easy and natural explication from them for the further clearing up of this point it is to be observed that what we immediately and properly see are only lights and colors in sundry situations and shades and degrees of faintness and clearness confusion and distinctness all which visible objects are only in the mind nor do they suggest ought external whether distance or magnitude otherwise than by habitual connection as words do things we are also to remark that beside the straining of the eyes and beside the vivid and faint the distinct and confused appearances which bearing some proportion to lines and angles have been substituted instead of them in the foregoing part of this treatise there are other means which suggest both distance and magnitude particularly the situation of visible points or objects as upper or lower the former suggesting a farther distance and greater magnitude the latter a nearer distance and lesser magnitude all which is an effect only of custom and experience there being really nothing intermediate in the line of distance between the uppermost and lowermost which are both aequidistant or rather at no distance from the eye as there is also nothing in upper or lower which by necessary connection should suggest greater or lesser magnitude now as these customary experimental means of suggesting distance do likewise suggest magnitude so they suggest the one as immediately as the other i say they do not vide sect liii first suggest distance and then leave the mind from thence to infer or compute magnitude but suggest magnitude as immediately and directly as they suggest distance  lxxviii this phenomenon of the horizontal moon is a clear instance of the insufficiency of lines and angles for explaining the way wherein the mind perceives and estimates the magnitude of outward objects there is nevertheless a use of computation by them in order to determine the apparent magnitude of things so far as they have a connection with and are proportional to those other ideas or perceptions which are the true and immediate occasions that suggest to the mind the apparent magnitude of things but this in general may i think be observed concerning mathematical computation in optics that it can never be very precise and exact since the judgments we make of the magnitude of external things do often depend on several circumstances which are not proportionable to or capable of being defined by lines and angles  lxxix from what has been said we may safely deduce this consequence to wit that a man born blind and made to see would at first opening of his eyes make a very different judgment of the magnitude of objects intromitted by them from what others do he would not consider the ideas of sight with reference to or as having any connection with the ideas of touch his view of them being entirely terminated within themselves he can no otherwise judge them great or small than as they contain a greater or lesser number of visible points now it being certain that any visible point can cover or exclude from view only one other visible point it follows that whatever object intercepts the view of another has an equal number of visible points with it and consequently they shall both be thought by him to have the same magnitude hence it is evident one in those circumstances would judge his thumb with which he might hide a tower or hinder its being seen equal to that tower or his hand the interposition whereof might conceal the firmament from his view equal to the firmament how great an inequality soever there may in our apprehensions seem to be betwixt those two things because of the customary and close connection that has grown up in our minds between the objects of sight and touch whereby the very different and distinct ideas of those two senses are so blended and confounded together as to be mistaken for one and the same thing out of which prejudice we cannot easily extricate our selves  lxxx for the better explaining the nature of vision and setting the manner wherein we perceive magnitudes in a due light i shall proceed to make some observations concerning matters relating thereto whereof the want of reflection and duly separating between tangible and visible ideas is apt to create in us mistaken and confused notions and first i shall observe that the minimum visibile is exactly equal in all beings whatsoever that are endowed with the visive faculty no exquisite formation of the eye no peculiar sharpness of sight can make it less in one creature than in another for it not being distinguishable into parts nor in any wise consisting of them it must necessarily be the same to all for suppose it otherwise and that the minimum visibile of a mite for instance be less than the minimum visibile of a man the latter therefore may by detraction of some part be made equal to the former it does therefore consist of parts which is inconsistent with the notion of a minimum visibile or point  lxxxi it will perhaps be objected that the minimum visibile of a man does really and in it self contain parts whereby it surpasses that of a mite though they are not perceivable by the man to which i answer the minimum visibile having in like manner as all other the proper and immediate objects of sight been shown not to have any existence without the mind of him who sees it it follows there cannot be any part of it that is not actually perceived and therefore visible now for any object to contain several distinct visible parts and at the same time to be a minimum visibile is a manifest contradiction  lxxxii of these visible points we see at all times an equal number it is every whit as great when our view is contracted and bounded by near objects as when it is extended to larger and remoter for it being impossible that one minimum visibile should obscure or keep out of sight more than one other it is a plain consequence that when my view is on all sides bounded by the walls of my study i see just as many visible points as i could in case that by the removal of the studywalls and all other obstructions i had a full prospect of the circumjacent fields mountains sea and open firmament for so long as i am shut up within the walls by their interposition every point of the external objects is covered from my view but each point that is seen being able to cover or exclude from sight one only other corresponding point it follows that whilst my sight is confined to those narrow walls i see as many points or minima visibilia as i should were those walls away by looking on all the external objects whose prospect is intercepted by them whenever therefore we are said to have a greater prospect at one time than another this must be understood with relation not to the proper and immediate but the secondary and mediate objects of vision which as has been shown properly belong to the touch  lxxxiii the visive faculty considered with reference to its immediate objects may be found to labor of two defects first in respect of the extent or number of visible points that are at once perceivable by it which is narrow and limited to a certain degree it can take in at one view but a certain determinate number of minima visibilia beyond which it cannot extend its prospect secondly our sight is defective in that its view is not only narrow but also for the most part confused of those things that we take in at one prospect we can see but a few at once clearly and unconfusedly and the more we fix our sight on any one object by so much the darker and more indistinct shall the rest appear  lxxxiv corresponding to these two defects of sight we may imagine as many perfections to wit  st that of comprehending in one view a greater number of visible points  dly of being able to view them all equally and at once with the utmost clearness and distinction that those perfections are not actually in some intelligences of a different order and capacity from ours it is impossible for us to know  lxxxv in neither of those two ways do microscopes contribute to the improvement of sight for when we look through a microscope we neither see more visible points nor are the collateral points more distinct than when we look with the naked eye at objects placed in a due distance a microscope brings us as it were into a new world it presents us with a new scene of visible objects quite different from what we behold with the naked eye but herein consists the most remarkable difference to wit that whereas the objects perceived by the eye alone have a certain connection with tangible objects whereby we are taught to foresee what will ensue upon the approach or application of distant objects to the parts of our own body which much conduces to its preservation there is not the like connection between things tangible and those visible objects that are perceived by help of a fine microscope  lxxxvi hence it is evident that were our eyes turned into the nature of microscopes we should not be much benefited by the change we should be deprived of the forementioned advantage we at present receive by the visive faculty and have left us only the empty amusement of seeing without any other benefit arising from it but in that case it will perhaps be said our sight would be endued with a far greater sharpness and penetration than it now has but i would fain know wherein consists that sharpness which is esteemed so great an excellency of sight it is certain from what we have already shown that the minimum visibile is never greater or lesser but in all cases constantly the same and in the case of microscopical eyes i see only this difference to wit that upon the ceasing of a certain observable connection betwixt the diverse perceptions of sight and touch which before enabled us to regulate our actions by the eye it would now be rendered utterly unserviceable to that purpose  lxxxvii upon the whole it seems that if we consider the use and end of sight together with the present state and circumstances of our being we shall not find any great cause to complain of any defect or imperfection in it or easily conceive how it could be mended with such admirable wisdom is that faculty contrived both for the pleasure and convenience of life  lxxxviii having finished what i intended to say concerning the distance and magnitude of objects i come now to treat of the manner wherein the mind perceives by sight their situation among the discoveries of the last age it is reputed none of the least that the manner of vision has been more clearly explained than ever it had been before there is at this day no one ignorant that the pictures of external objects are painted on the retina or fund of the eye that we can see nothing which is not so painted and that according as the picture is more distinct or confused so also is the perception we have of the object but then in this explication of vision there occurs one mighty difficulty the objects are painted in an inverted order on the bottom of the eye the upper part of any object being painted on the lower part of the eye and the lower part of the object on the upper part of the eye and so also as to right and left since therefore the pictures are thus inverted it is demanded how it comes to pass that we see the objects erect and in their natural posture  lxxxix in answer to this difficulty we are told that the mind perceiving an impulse of a ray of light on the upper part of the eye considers this ray as coming in a direct line from the lower part of the object and in like manner tracing the ray that strikes on the lower part of the eye it is directed to the upper part of the object thus in the adjacent figure c the lower point of the object a b c is projected on c the upper part of the eye so likewise the highest point a is projected on a the lowest part of the eye which makes the representation c b a inverted but the mind considering the stroke that is made on c as coming in the straight line c c from the lower end of the object and the stroke or impulse on a as coming in the line a a from the upper end of the object is directed to make a right judgment of the situation of the object a b c notwithstanding the picture of it is inverted this is illustrated by conceiving a blind man who holding in his hands two sticks that cross each other does with them touch the extremities of an object placed in a perpendicular situation it is certain this man will judge that to be the upper part of the object which he touches with the stick held in the undermost hand and that to be the lower part of the object which he touches with the stick in his uppermost hand this is the common explication of the erect appearance of objects which is generally received and acquiesced in being as mr molyneux tells us diopt par   c   p      allowed by all men as satisfactory  xc but this account to me does not seem in any degree true did i perceive those impulses decussations and directions of the rays of light in like manner as has been set forth then indeed it would not at first view be altogether void of probability and there might be some pretense for the comparison of the blindman and his cross sticks but the case is far otherwise i know very well that i perceive no such thing and of consequence i cannot thereby make an estimate of the situation of objects i appeal to any ones experience whether he be conscious to himself that he thinks on the intersection made by the radious pencils or pursues the impulses they give in right lines whenever he perceives by sight the position of any object to me it seems evident that crossing and tracing of the rays is never thought on by children idiots or in truth by any other save only those who have applied themselves to the study of optics and for the mind to judge of the situation of objects by those things without perceiving them or to perceive them without knowing it is equally beyond my comprehension add to this that the explaining the manner of vision by the example of cross sticks and hunting for the object along the axes of the radious pencils does suppose the proper objects of sight to be perceived at a distance from us contrary to what has been demonstrated  xci it remains therefore that we look for some other explication of this difficulty and i believe it not impossible to find one provided we examine it to the bottom and carefully distinguish between the ideas of sight and touch which cannot be too often inculcated in treating of vision but more especially throughout the consideration of this affair we ought to carry that distinction in our thoughts for that from want of a right understanding thereof the difficulty of explaining erect vision seems chiefly to arise  xcii in order to disentangle our minds from whatever prejudices we may entertain with relation to the subject in hand nothing seems more apposite than the taking into our thoughts the case of one born blind and afterward when grown up made to see and though perhaps it may not be an easy task to divest our selves entirely of the experience received from sight so as to be able to put our thoughts exactly in the posture of such a ones we must nevertheless as far as possible endeavor to frame true conceptions of what might reasonably be supposed to pass in his mind  xciii it is certain that a man actually blind and who had continued so from his birth would by the sense of feeling attain to have ideas of upper and lower by the motion of his hand he might discern the situation of any tangible object placed within his reach that part on which he felt himself supported or toward which he perceived his body to gravitate he would term lower and the contrary to this upper and accordingly denominate whatsoever objects he touched  xciv but then whatever judgments he makes concerning the situation of objects are confined to those only that are perceivable by touch all those things that are intangible and of a spiritual nature his thoughts and desires his passions and in general all the modifications of his soul to these he would never apply the terms upper and lower except only in a metaphorical sense he may perhaps by way of allusion speak of high or low thoughts but those terms in their proper signification would never be applied to any thing that was not conceived to exist without the mind for a man born blind and remaining in the same state could mean nothing else by the words higher and lower than a greater or lesser distance from the earth which distance he would measure by the motion or application of his hand or some other part of his body it is therefore evident that all those things which in respect of each other would by him be thought higher or lower must be such as were conceived to exist without his mind in the ambient space  xcv whence it plainly follows that such a one if we suppose him made to see would not at first sight think that any thing he saw was high or low erect or inverted for it has been already demonstrated in sect xli that he would not think the things he perceived by sight to be at any distance from him or without his mind the objects to which he had hitherto been used to apply the terms up and down high and low were such only as affected or were some way perceived by his touch but the proper objects of vision make a new set of ideas perfectly distinct and different from the former and which can in no sort make themselves perceived by touch there is therefore nothing at all that could induce him to think those terms applicable to them nor would he ever think it till such time as he had observed their connection with tangible objects and the same prejudices began to insinuate it self into his understanding which from their infancy had grown up in the understandings of other men  xcvi to set this matter in a clearer light i shall make use of an example suppose the abovementioned blind person by his touch perceives a man to stand erect let us inquire into the manner of this by the application of his hand to the several parts of a humane body he had perceived different tangible ideas which being collected into sundry complex ones have distinct names annexed to them thus one combination of a certain tangible figure bulk and consistency of parts is called the head another the hand a third the foot and so of the rest all which complex ideas could in his understanding be made up only of ideas perceivable by touch he had also by his touch obtained an idea of earth or ground toward which he perceives the parts of his body to have a natural tendency now by erect nothing more being meant than that perpendicular position of a man wherein his feet are nearest to the earth if the blind person by moving his hand over the parts of the man who stands before him perceives the tangible ideas that compose the head to be farthest from and those that compose the feet to be nearest to that other combination of tangible ideas which he calls earth he will denominate that man erect but if we suppose him on a sudden to receive his sight and that he behold a man standing before him it is evident in that case he would neither judge the man he sees to be erect nor inverted for he never having known those terms applied to any other save tangible things or which existed in the space without him and what he sees neither being tangible nor perceived as existing without he could not know that in propriety of language they were applicable to it  xcvii afterward when upon turning his head or eyes up and down to the right and left he shall observe the visible objects to change and shall also attain to know that they are called by the same names and connected with the objects perceived by touch then indeed he will come to speak of them and their situation in the same terms that he has been used to apply to tangible things and those that he perceives by turning up his eyes he will call upper and those that by turning down his eyes he will call lower  xcviii and this seems to me the true reason why he should think those objects uppermost that are painted on the lower part of his eye for by turning the eye up they shall be distinctly seen as likewise those that are painted on the highest part of the eye shall be distinctly seen by turning the eye down and are for that reason esteemed lowest for we have shown that to the immediate objects of sight considered in themselves he would not attribute the terms high and low it must therefore be on account of some circumstances which are observed to attend them and these it is plain are the actions of turning the eye up and down which suggest a very obvious reason why the mind should denominate the objects of sight accordingly high or low and without this motion of the eye this turning it up and down in order to discern different objects doubtless erect inverse and other the like terms relating to the position of tangible objects would never have been transferred or in any degree apprehended to belong to the ideas of sight the mere act of seeing including nothing in it to that purpose whereas the different situations of the eye naturally direct the mind to make a suitable judgment of the situation of objects intromitted by it  xcix farther when he has by experience learned the connection there is between the several ideas of sight and touch he will be able by the perception he has of the situation of visible things in respect of one another to make a sudden and true estimate of the situation of outward tangible things corresponding to them and thus it is he shall perceive by sight the situation of external objects which do not properly fall under that sense  c i know we are very prone to think that if just made to see we should judge of the situation of visible things as we do now but we are also as prone to think that at first sight we should in the same way apprehend the distance and magnitude of objects as we do now which has been shown to be a false and groundless persuasion and for the like reasons the same censure may be past on the positive assurance that most men before they have thought sufficiently of the matter might have of their being able to determine by the eye at first view whether objects were erect or inverse  ci it will perhaps be objected to our opinion that a man for instance being thought erect when his feet are next the earth and inverted when his head is next the earth it does hence follow that by the mere act of vision without any experience or altering the situation of the eye we should have determined whether he were erect or inverted for both the earth it self and the limbs of the man who stands thereon being equally perceived by sight one cannot choose seeing what part of the man is nearest the earth and what part farthest from it i e whether he be erect or inverted  cii to which i answer the ideas which constitute the tangible earth and man are entirely different from those which constitute the visible earth and man nor was it possible by virtue of the visive faculty alone without superadding any experience of touch or altering the position of the eye ever to have known or so much as suspected there had been any relation or connection between them hence a man at first view would not denominate any thing he saw earth or head or foot and consequently he could not tell by the mere act of vision whether the head or feet were nearest the earth nor indeed would we have thereby any thought of earth or man erect or inverse at all which will be made yet more evident if we nicely observe and make a particular comparison between the ideas of both senses  ciii that which i see is only variety of light and colors that which i feel is hard or soft hot or cold rough or smooth what similitude what connection have those ideas with these or how is it possible that any one should see reason to give one and the same name to combinations of ideas so very different before he had experienced their coexistence we do not find there is any necessary connection betwixt this or that tangible quality and any color whatsoever and we may sometimes perceive colors where there is nothing to be felt all which does make it manifest that no man at first receiving of his sight would know there was any agreement between this or that particular object of his sight and any object of touch he had been already acquainted with the colors therefore of the head would to him no more suggest the idea of head than they would the idea of foot  civ farther we have at large shown vid sect lxiii and lxiv there is no dicoverable necessary connection between any given visible magnitude and any one particular tangible magnitude but that it is entirely the result of custom and experience and depends on foreign and accidental circumstances that we can by the perception of visible extension inform our selves what may be the extension of any tangible object connected with it hence it is certain that neither the visible magnitude of head or foot would bring along with them into the mind at first opening of the eyes the respective tangible magnitudes of those parts  cv by the foregoing section it is plain the visible figure of any part of the body has no necessary connection with the tangible figure thereof so as at first sight to suggest it to the mind for figure is the termination of magnitude whence it follows that no visible magnitude having in its own nature an aptness to suggest any one particular tangible magnitude so neither can any visible figure be inseparably connected with its corresponding tangible figure so as of it self and in a way prior to experience it might suggest it to the understanding this will be farther evident if we consider that what seems smooth and round to the touch may to sight if viewed through a microscope seem quite otherwise  cvi from all which laid together and duly considered we may clearly deduce this inference in the first act of vision no idea entering by the eye would have a perceivable connection with the ideas to which the names earth man head foot etc were annexed in the understanding of a person blind from his birth so as in any sort to introduce them into his mind or make themselves be called by the same names and reputed the same things with them as afterward they come to be  cvii there does nevertheless remain one difficulty which perhaps may seem to press hard on our opinion and deserve not to be passed over for though it be granted that neither the color size nor figure of the visible feet have any necessary connection with the ideas that compose the tangible feet so as to bring them at first sight into my mind or make me in danger of confounding them before i had been used to and for some time experienced their connection yet thus much seems undeniable namely that the number of the visible feet being the same with that of the tangible feet i may from hence without any experience of sight reasonably conclude that they represent or are connected with the feet rather than the head i say it seems the idea of two visible feet will sooner suggest to the mind the idea of two tangible feet than of one head so that the blind man upon first reception of the visive faculty might know which were the feet or two and which the head or one  cviii in order to get clear of this seeming difficulty we need only observe that diversity of visible objects does not necessarily infer diversity of tangible objects corresponding to them a picture painted with great variety of colors affects the touch in one uniform manner it is therefore evident that i do not by any necessary consecution independent of experience judge of the number of things tangible from the number of things visible i should not therefore at first opening my eyes conclude that because i see two i shall feel two how therefore can i before experience teaches me know that the visible legs because two are connected with the tangible legs or the visible head because one is connected with the tangible head the truth is the things i see are so very different and heterogeneous from the things i feel that the perception of the one would never have suggested the other to my thoughts or enabled me to pass the least judgment thereon until i had experienced their connection  cix but for a fuller illustration of this matter it ought to be considered that number however some may reckon it amongst the primary qualities is nothing fixed and settled really existing in things themselves it is entirely the creature of the mind considering either an idea by it self or any combination of ideas to which it gives one name and so makes it pass for an unite according as the mind variously combines its ideas the unite varies and as the unite so the number which is only a collection of unites does also vary we call a window one a chimney one and yet a house in which there are many windows and many chimneys has an equal right to be called one and many houses go to the making of one city in these and the like instances it is evident the unite constantly relates to the particular draughts the mind makes of its ideas to which it affixes names and wherein it includes more or less as best suits its own ends and purposes whatever therefore the mind considers as one that is an unite every combination of ideas is considered as one thing by the mind and in token thereof is marked by one name now this naming and combining together of ideas is perfectly arbitrary and done by the mind in such sort as experience shows it to be most convenient without which our ideas had never been collected into such sundry distinct combinations as they now are  cx hence it follows that a man born blind and afterward when grown up made to see would not in the first act of vision parcel out the ideas of sight into the same distinct collections that others do who have experienced which do regularly coexist and are proper to be bundled up together under one name he would not for example make into one complex idea and thereby esteem and unite all those particular ideas which constitute the visible head or foot for there can be no reason assigned why he should do so barely upon his seeing a man stand upright before him there crowd into his mind the ideas which compose the visible man in company with all the other ideas of sight perceived at the same time but all these ideas offered at once to his view he would not distribute into sundry distinct combinations till such as by observing the motion of the parts of the man and other experiences he comes to know which are to be separated and which to be collected together  cxi from what has been premised it is plain the objects of sight and touch make if i may so say two sets of ideas which are widely different from each other to objects of either kind we indifferently attribute the terms high and low right and left and such like denoting the position or situation of things but then we must well observe that the position of any object is determined with respect only to objects of the same sense we say any object of touch is high or low according as it is more or less distant from the tangible earth and in like manner we denominate any object of sight high or low in proportion as it is more or less distant from the visible earth but to define the situation of visible things with relation to the distance they bear from any tangible thing or vice versa this were absurd and perfectly untintelligible for all visible things are equally in the mind and take up no part of the external space and consequently are equidistant from any tangible thing which exists without the mind  cxii or rather to speak truly the proper objects of sight are at no distance neither near nor far from any tangible thing for if we inquire narrowly into the matter we shall find that those things only are compared together in respect of distance which exist after the same manner or appertain unto the same sense for by the distance between any two points nothing more is meant than the number of intermediate points if the given points are visible the distance between them is marked out by the number of the interjacent visible points if they are tangible the distance between them is a line consisting of tangible points but if they are one tangible and the other visible the distance between them does neither consist of points perceivable by sight nor by touch i e it is utterly inconceivable this perhaps will not find an easy admission into all mens understanding however i should gladly be informed whether it be not true by any one who will be at the pains to reflect a little and apply it home to his thoughts  cxiii the not observing what has been delivered in the two last sections seems to have occasioned no small part of the difficulty that occurs in the business of erect appearances the head which is painted nearest the earth seems to be farthest from it and on the other hand the feet which are painted farthest from the earth are thought nearest to it herein lies the difficulty which vanishes if we express the thing more clearly and free from ambiguity thus how comes it that to the eye the visible head which is nearest the tangible earth seems farthest from the earth and the visible feet which are farthest from the tangible earth seem nearest the earth the question being thus proposed who sees not the difficulty is founded on a supposition that the eye or visive faculty or rather the soul by means thereof should judge of the situation of visible objects with reference to their distance from the tangible earth whereas it is evident the tangible earth is not perceived by sight and it has been shown in the two last preceding sections that the location of visible objects is determined only by the distance they bear from one another and that it is nonsense to talk of distance far or near between a visible and tangible thing  cxiv if we confine our thoughts to the proper objects of sight the whole is plain and easy the head is painted farthest from and the feet nearest to the visible earth and so they appear to be what is there strange or unaccountable in this let us suppose the pictures in the fund of the eye to be the immediate objects of the sight the consequence is that things should appear in the same posture they are painted in and is it not so the head which is seen seems farthest from the earth which is seen and the feet which are seen seem nearest to the earth which is seen and just so they are painted  cxv but say you the picture of the man is inverted and yet the appearance is erect i ask what mean you by the picture of the man or which is the same thing the visible mans being inverted you tell me it is inverted because the heels are uppermost and the head undermost explain me this you say that by the heads being undermost you mean that it is nearest to the earth and by the heels being uppermost that they are farthest from the earth i ask again what earth you mean you cannot mean the earth that is painted on the eye or the visible earth for the picture of the head is farthest from the picture of the earth and the picture of the feet nearest to the picture of the earth and accordingly the visible head is farthest from the visible earth and the visible feet nearest to it it remains therefore that you mean the tangible earth and so determine the situation of visible things with respect to tangible things contrary to what has been demonstrated in sect cxi and cxii the two distinct provinces of sight and touch should be considered apart and as if their objects had no intercourse no manner of relation to one another in point of distance or position  cxvi farther what greatly contributes to make us mistake in this matter is that when we think of the pictures in the fund of the eye we imagine our selves looking on the fund of anothers eye or another looking on the fund of our own eye and beholding the pictures painted thereon suppose two eyes a and b a from some distance looking on the pictures in b sees them inverted and for that reason concludes they are inverted in b but this is wrong there are projected in little on the bottom of a the images of the pictures of suppose man earth etc which are painted on b and besides these the eye b it self and the objects which environ it together with another earth are projected in a larger size on a now by the eye a these larger images are deemed the true objects and the lesser only pictures in miniature and it is with respect to those greater images that it determines the situation of the smaller images so that comparing the little man with the great earth a judges him inverted or that the feet are farthest from and the head nearest to the great earth whereas if a compare the little man with the little earth then he will appear erect i e his head shall seem farthest from and his feet nearest to the little earth but we must consider that b does not see two earths as a does it sees only what is represented by the little pictures in a and consequently shall judge the man erect for in truth the man in b is not inverted for there the feet are next the earth but it is the representation of it in a which is inverted for there the head of the representation of the picture of the man in b is next the earth and the feet farthest from the earth meaning the earth which is without the representation of the pictures in b for if you take the little images of the pictures in b and consider them by themselves and with respect only to one another they are all erect and in their natural posture  cxvii farther there lies a mistake in our imagining that the pictures of external objects are painted on the bottom of the eye it has been shown there is no resemblance between the ideas of sight and things tangible it has likewise been demonstrated that the proper objects of sight do not exist without the mind whence it clearly follows that the pictures painted on the bottom of the eye are not the pictures of external objects let any one consult his own thoughts and then say what affinity what likeness there is between that certain variety and disposition of colors which constitute the visible man or picture of a man and that other combination of far different ideas sensible by touch which compose the tangible man but if this be the case how come they to be accounted pictures or images since that supposes them to copy or represent some originals or other  cxviii to which i answer in the forementioned instance the eye a takes the little images included within the representation of the other eye b to be pictures or copies whereof the archetypes are not things existing without but the larger pictures projected on its own fund and which by a are not thought pictures but the originals or true things themselves though if we suppose a third eye c from a due distance to behold the fund of a then indeed the things projected thereon shall to c seem pictures or images in the same sense that those projected on b do to a  cxix rightly to conceive this point we must carefully distinguish between the ideas of sight and touch between the visible and tangible eye for certainly on the tangible eye nothing either is or seems to be painted again the visible eye as well as all other visible objects has been shown to exist only in the mind which perceiving its own ideas and comparing them together calls some pictures in respect of others what has been said being rightly comprehended and laid together does i think afford a full and genuine explication of the erect appearance of objects which phenomenon i must confess i do not see how it can be explained by any theories of vision hitherto made public  cxx in treating of these things the use of language is apt to occasion some obscurity and confusion and create in us wrong ideas for language being accommodated to the common notions and prejudices of men it is scarce possible to deliver the naked and precise truth without great circumlocution impropriety and to an unwary reader seeming contradictions i do therefore once for all desire whoever shall think it worth his while to understand what i have written concerning vision that he would not stick in this or that phrase or manner of expression but heartily collect my meaning from the whole sum and tenor of my discourse and laying aside the words as much as possible consider the bare notions themselves and then judge whether they are agreeable to truth and his own experience or no  cxxi we have shown the way wherein the mind by mediation of visible ideas does perceive or apprehend the distance magnitude and situation of tangible objects i come now to inquire more particularly concerning the difference between the ideas of sight and touch which are called by the same names and see whether there be any idea common to both senses from what we have at large set forth and demonstrated in the foregoing parts of this treatise it is plain there is no one self same numerical extension perceived both by sight and touch but that the particular figures and extensions perceived by sight however they may be called by the same names and reputed the same things with those perceived by touch are nevertheless different and have an existence distinct and separate from them so that the question is not now concerning the same numerical ideas but whether there be any one and the same sort or species of ideas equally perceiveable to both senses or in other words whether extension figure and motion perceived by sight are not specifically distinct from extension figure and motion perceived by touch  cxxii but before i come more particularly to discuss this matter i find it proper to consider extension in abstract for of this there is much talk and i apt to think that when men speak of extension as being an idea common to two senses it is with a secret supposition that we can single out extension from all other tangible and visible qualities and form thereof an abstract idea which idea they will have common both to sight and touch we are therefore to understand by extension in abstract an idea of extension for instance a line or surface entirely stripped of all other sensible qualities and circumstances that might determine it to any particular existence it is neither black nor white nor red nor has it any color at all or any tangible quality whatsoever and consequently it is of no finite determinate magnitude for that which bounds or distinguishes one extension from another is some quality or circumstance wherein they disagree  cxxiii now i do not find that i can perceive imagine or any wise frame in my mind such an abstract idea as is here spoken of a line or surface which is neither black nor white nor blue nor yellow etc nor long nor short nor rough nor smooth nor square nor round etc is perfectly incomprehensible this i am sure of as to my self how far the faculties of other men may reach they best can tell  cxxiv it is commonly said that the object of geometry is abstract extension but geometry contemplates figures now figure is the termination of magnitude but we have shown that extension in abstract has no finite determinate magnitude whence it clearly follows that it can have no figure and consequently is not the object of geometry it is indeed a tenet as well of the modern as of the ancient philosophers that all general truths are concerning universal abstract ideas without which we are told there could be no science no demonstration of any general proposition in geometry but it were no hard matter did i think it necessary to my present purpose to show that propositions and demonstrations in geometry might be universal though they who make them never think of abstract general ideas of triangles or circles  cxxv after reiterated endeavors to apprehend the general idea of a triangle i have found it altogether incomprehensible and surely if any one were able to introduce that idea into my mind it must be the author of the essay concerning humane understanding he who has so far distinguished himself from the generality of writers by the clearness and significancy of what he says let us therefore see how this celebrated author describes the general or abstract idea of a triangle it must be says he neither oblique nor rectangular neither equilateral equicrural nor scalenum but all and none of these at once in effect it is somewhat imperfect that cannot exist an idea wherein some parts of several different and inconsistent ideas are put together essay on hum understanding b iv c   s   this is the idea which he thinks needful for the enlargement of knowledge which is the subject of mathematical demonstration and without which we could never come to know any general proposition concerning triangles that author acknowledges it does require some pains and skill to form this general idea of a triangle ibid but had he called to mind what he says in another place to wit that ideas of mixed modes wherein any inconsistent ideas are put together cannot so much as exist in the mind i e be conceived vid b iii c  0 s    ibid i say had this occurred to his thoughts it is not improbable he would have owed it above all the pains and skill he was master of to form the abovementioned idea of a triangle which is made up of manifest staring contradictions that a man who thought so much and laid so great a stress on clear and determinate ideas should nevertheless talk at this rate seems very surprising but the wonder will lessen if it be considered that the source whence this opinion flows is the prolific womb which has brought forth innumerable errors and difficulties in all parts of philosophy and in all the sciences but this matter taken in its full extent were a subject too vast and comprehensive to be insisted on in this place and so much for extension in abstract  cxxvi some perhaps may think pure space vacuum or trine dimension to be equally the object of sight and touch but though we have a very great propension to think the ideas of outness and space to be the immediate object of sight yet if i mistake not in the foregoing parts of this essay that has been clearly demonstrated to be a mere delusion arising from the quick and sudden suggestion of fancy which so closely connects the idea of distance with those of sight that we are apt to think it is it self a proper and immediate object of that sense till reason corrects the mistake  cxxvii it having been shown that there are no abstract ideas of figure and that it is impossible for us by any precision of thought to frame an idea of extension separate from all other visible and tangible qualities which shall be common both to sight and touch the question now remaining is whether the particular extensions figures and motions perceived by sight be of the same kind with the particular extensions figures and motions perceived by touch in answer to which i shall venture to lay down the following proposition the extension figures and motions perceived by sight are specifically distinct from the ideas of touch called by the same names nor is there any such thing as one idea or kind of idea common to both senses this proposition may without much difficulty be collected from what has been said in several places of this essay but because it seems so remote from and contrary to the received notions and settled opinion of mankind i shall attempt to demonstrate it more particularly and at large by the following arguments  cxxviii when upon perception of an idea i range it under this or that sort it is because it is perceived after the same manner or because it has a likeness or conformity with or affects me in the same way as the ideas of the sort i rank it under in short it must not be entirely new but have something in it old and already perceived by me it must i say have so much at least in common with the ideas i have before known and named as to make me give it the same name with them but it has been if i mistake not clearly made out that a man born blind would not at first reception of his sight think the things he saw were of the same nature with the objects of touch or had any thing in common with them but that they were a new set of ideas perceived in a new manner and entirely different from all he had ever perceived before so that he would not call them by the same name nor repute them to be of the same sort with any thing he had hitherto known  cxxix secondly light and colors are allowed by all to constitute a sort or species entirely different from the ideas of touch nor will any man i presume say they can make themselves perceived by that sense but there is no other immediate object of sight besides light and colors it is therefore a direct consequence that there is no idea common to both senses  cxxx it is a prevailing opinion even amongst those who have thought and writ most accurately concerning our ideas and the ways whereby they enter into the understanding that something more is perceived by sight than barely light and colors with their variations mr lock terms sight the most comprehensive of all our senses conveying to our minds the ideas of light and colors which are peculiar only to that sense and also the far different ideas of space figure and motion essay on human understand b ii c   s   space or distance we have shown is no otherwise the object of sight than of hearing vid sect xlvi and as for figure and extension i leave it to any one that shall calmly attend to his own clear and distinct ideas to decide whether he has any idea intromitted immediately and properly by sight save only light and colors or whether it be possible for him to frame in his mind a distinct abstract idea of visible extension or figure exclusive of all color and on the other hand whether he can conceive color without visible extension for my own part i must confess i am not able to attain so great a nicety of abstraction in a strict sense i see nothing but light and colors with their several shades and variations he who beside these does also perceive by sight ideas far different and distinct from them has that faculty in a degree more perfect and comprehensive than i can pretend to it must be owned that by the mediation of light and colors other far different ideas are suggested to my mind but so they are by hearing which beside sounds which are peculiar to that sense does by their mediation suggest not only space figure and motion but also all other ideas whatsoever that can be signified by words  cxxxi thirdly it is i think an axiom universally received that quantities of the same kind may be added together and make one entire sum mathematicians add lines together but they do not add a line to a solid or conceive it as making one sum with a surface these three kinds of quantity being thought incapable of any such mutual addition and consequently of being compared together in the several ways of proportion are by them esteemed entirely disparate and heterogeneous now let any one try in his thoughts to add a visible line or surface to a tangible line or surface so as to conceive them making one continued sum or whole he that can do this may think them homogeneous but he that cannot must by the foregoing axiom think them heterogeneous a blue and a red line i can conceive added together into one sum and making one continued line but to make in my thoughts one continued line of a visible and tangible line added together is i find a task far more difficult and even insurmountable and i leave it to the reflection and experience of every particular person to determine for himself  cxxxii a farther confirmation of our tenet may be drawn from the solution of mr molyneuxs problem published by mr lock in his essay which i shall set down as it there lies together with mr lockes opinion of it suppose a man born blind and now adult and taught by his touch to distinguish between a cube and a sphere of the same metal and nighly of the same bigness so as to tell when he felt one and the other which is the cube and which the sphere suppose then the cube and sphere placed on a table and the blind man to be made to see quaere whether by his sight before he touched them he could now distinguish and tell which is the globe which the cube to which the acute and judicious proposer answers not for though he has obtained the experience of how a globe how a cube affects his touch yet he has not yet attained the experience that what affects his touch so or so must affect his sight so or so or that a protuberant angle in the cube that pressed his hand unequally shall appear to his eye as it does in the cube i agree with this thinking gentleman whom i am proud to call my friend in his answer to this his problem and am of opinion that the blind man at first sight would not be able with certainty to say which was the globe which the cube whilst he only saw them essay on human understanding b ii c   s    cxxxiii now if a square surface perceived by touch be of the same sort with a square surface perceived by sight it is certain the blind man here mentioned might know a square surface as soon as he saw it it is no more but introduced into his mind by a new inlet an idea he has been already well acquainted with since therefore he is supposed to have known by his touch that a cube is a body terminated by square surfaces and that a sphere is not terminated by square surfaces upon the supposition that a visible and tangible square differ only in numero it follows that he might know by the unerring mark of the square surfaces which was the cube and which not while he only saw them we must therefore allow either that visible extension and figures are specifically distinct from tangible extension and figures or else that the solution of this problem given by those two thoughtful and ingenious men is wrong  cxxxiv much more might be laid together in proof of the proposition i have advanced but what has been said is if i mistake not sufficient to convince any one that shall yield a reasonable attention and as for those that will not be at the pains of a little thought no multiplication of words will ever suffice to make them understand the truth or rightly conceive my meaning  cxxxv i cannot let go the abovementioned problem without some reflection on it it has been made evident that a man blind from his birth would not at first sight denominate any thing he saw by the names he had been used to appropriate to ideas of touch vid sect cvi cube sphere table are words he has known applied to things perceivable by touch but to things perfectly intangible he never knew them applied those words in their wonted application always marked out to his mind bodies or solid things which were perceived by the resistance they gave but there is no solidity no resistance or protrusion perceived by sight in short the ideas of sight are all new perceptions to which there be no names annexed in his mind he cannot therefore understand what is said to him concerning them and to ask of the two bodies he saw placed on the table which was the sphere which the cube were to him a question downright bantering and unintelligible nothing he sees being able to suggest to his thoughts the idea of body distance or in general of any thing he had already known  cxxxvi it is a mistake to think the same thing affects both sight and touch if the same angle or square which is the object of touch be also the object of vision what should hinder the blind man at first sight from knowing it for though the manner wherein it affects the sight be different from that wherein it affected his touch yet there being beside this manner or circumstance which is new and unknown the angle or figure which is old and known he cannot choose but discern it  cxxxvii visible figure and extension having been demonstrated to be of a nature entirely different and heterogeneous from tangible figure and extension it remains that we inquire concerning motion now that visible motion is not of the same sort with tangible motion seems to need no farther proof it being an evident corollary from what we have shown concerning the difference there is between visible and tangible extension but for a more full and express proof hereof we need only observe that one who had not yet experienced vision would not at first sight know motion whence it clearly follows that motion perceivable by sight is of a sort distinct from motion perceivable by touch the antecedent i prove thus by touch he could not perceive any motion but what was up or down to the right or left nearer or farther from him besides these and their several varieties or complications it is impossible he should have any idea of motion he would not therefore think any thing to be motion or give the name motion to any idea which he could not range under some or other of those particular kinds thereof but from sect xcv it is plain that by the mere act of vision he could not know motion upwards or downwards to the right or left or in any other possible direction from which i conclude he would not know motion at all at first sight as for the idea of motion in abstract i shall not waste paper about it but leave it to my reader to make the best he can on it to me it is perfectly unintelligible  cxxxviii the consideration of motion may furnish a new field for inquiry but since the manner wherein the mind apprehends by sight the motion of tangible objects with the various degrees thereof may be easily collected from what has been said concerning the manner wherein that sense does suggest their various distances magnitudes and situations i shall not enlarge any farther on this subject but proceed to inquire what may be alleged with greatest appearance of reason against the proposition we have shown to be true for where there is so much prejudice to be encountered a bare and naked demonstration of the truth will scarce suffice we must also satisfy the scruples that men may raise in favor of their preconceived notions show whence the mistake arises how it came to spread and carefully disclose and root out those false persuasions that an early prejudice might have implanted in the mind  cxxxix first therefore it will be demanded how visible extension and figures come to be called by the same name with tangible extension and figures if they are not of the same kind with them it must be something more than humor or accident that could occasion a custom so constant and universal as this which has obtained in all ages and nations of the world and amongst all ranks of men the learned as well as the illiterate  cxl to which i answer we can no more argue a visible and tangible square to be of the same species from their being called by the same name than we can that a tangible square and the monosyllable consisting of six letters whereby it is marked are of the same species because they are both called by the same name it is customary to call written words and the things they signify by the same name for words not being regarded in their own nature or otherwise than as they are marks of things it had been superfluous and beside the design of language to have given them names distinct from those of the things marked by them the same reason holds here also visible figures are the marks of tangible figures and from sect lix it is plain that in themselves they are little regarded or upon any other score than for their connection with tangible figures which by nature they are ordained to signify and because this language of nature does not vary in different ages or nations hence it is that in all times and places visible figures are called by the same names as the respective tangible figures suggested by them and not because they are alike or of the same sort with them  cxli but say you surely a tangible square is liker to a visible square than to a visible circle it has four angles and as many sides so also has the visible square but the visible circle has no such thing being bounded by one uniform curve without right lines or angles which makes it unfit to represent the tangible square but very fit to represent the tangible circle whence it clearly follows that visible figures are patrons of or of the same species with the respective tangible figures represented by them that they are like unto them and of their own nature fitted to represent them as being of the same sort and that they are in no respect arbitrary signs as words  cxlii i answer it must be acknowledged the visible square is fitter than the visible circle to represent the tangible square but then it is not because it is liker or more of a species with it but because the visible square contains in it several distinct parts whereby to mark the several distinct corresponding parts of a tangible square whereas the visible circle does not the square perceived by touch has four distinct equal sides so also has it four distinct equal angles it is therefore necessary that the visible figures which shall be most proper to mark it contain four distinct equal parts corresponding to the four sides of the tangible square as likewise four other distinct and equal parts whereby to denote the four equal angles of the tangible square and accordingly we see the visible figures contain in them distinct visible parts answering to the distinct tangible parts of the figures signified or suggested by them  cxliii but it will not hence follow that any visible figure is like unto or of the same species with its corresponding tangible figure unless it be also shown that not only the number but also the kind of the parts be the same in both to illustrate this i observe that visible figures represent tangible figures much after the same manner that written words do sounds now in this respect words are not arbitrary it not being indifferent what written word stands for any sound but it is requisite that each word contain in it so many distinct characters as there are variations in the sound in stands for thus the single letter a is proper to mark one simple uniform sound and the word adultery is accommodated to represent the sound annexed to it in the formation whereof there being eight different collisions or modifications of the air by the organs of speech each of which produces a difference of sound it was fit the word representing it should consist of as many distinct characters thereby to mark each particular difference or part of the whole sound and yet no body i presume will say the single letter a or the word adultery are like unto or of the same species with the respective sounds by them represented it is indeed arbitrary that in general letters of any language represent sounds at all but when that is once agreed it is not arbitrary what combination of letters shall represent this or that particular sound i leave this with the reader to pursue and apply it in his own thoughts  cxliv it must be confessed that we are not so apt to confound other signs with the things signified or to think them of the same species as we are visible and tangible ideas but a little consideration will show us how this may be without our supposing them of a like nature these signs are constant and universal their connection with tangible ideas has been learnt at our first entrance into the world and ever since almost every moment of our lives it has been occurring to our thoughts and fastening and striking deeper on our minds when we observe that signs are variable and of humane institution when we remember there was a time they were not connected in our minds with those things they now so readily suggest but that their signification was learned by the slow steps of experience this preserves us from confounding them but when we find the same signs suggest the same things all over the world when we know they are not of humane institution and cannot remember that we ever learned their signification but think that at first sight they would have suggested to us the same things they do now all this persuades us they are of the same species as the things respectively represented by them and that it is by a natural resemblance they suggest them to our minds  cxlv add to this that whenever we make a nice survey of any object successively directing the optic axis to each point thereof there are certain lines and figures described by the motion of the head or eye which being in truth perceived by feeling do nevertheless so mix themselves as it were with the ideas of sight that we can scarce think but they appertain to that sense again the ideas of sight enter into the mind several at once more distinct and unmingled than is usual in the other senses beside the touch sounds for example perceived at the same instant are apt to coalesce if i may so say into one sound but we can perceive at the same time great variety of visible objects very separate and distinct from each other now tangible extension being made up of several distinct coexistent parts we may hence gather another reason that may dispose us to imagine a likeness or analogy between the immediate objects of sight and touch but nothing certainly does more contribute to blend and confound them together than the strict and close connection they have with each other we cannot open our eyes but the ideas of distance bodies and tangible figures are suggested by them so swift and sudden and unperceived is the transition from visible to tangible ideas that we can scarce forbear thinking them equally the immediate object of vision  cxlvi the prejudice which is grounded on these and whatever other causes may be assigned thereof sticks so fast that it is impossible without obstinate striving and labor of the mind to get entirely clear of it but then the reluctance we find in rejecting any opinion can be no argument of its truth to whoever considers what has been already shown with regard to the prejudices we entertain concerning the distance magnitude and situation of objects prejudices so familiar to our minds so confirmed and inveterate as they will hardly give way to the clearest demonstration  cxlvii upon the whole i think we may fairly conclude that the proper objects of vision constitute an universal language of the author of nature whereby we are instructed how to regulate our actions in order to attain those things that are necessary to the preservation and wellbeing of our bodies as also to avoid whatever may be hurtful and destructive of them it is by their information that we are principally guided in all the transactions and concerns of life and the manner wherein they signify and mark unto us the objects which are at a distance is the same with that of languages and signs of humane appointment which do not suggest the things signified by any likeness or indentity of nature but only by an habitual connection that experience has made us to observe between them  cxlviii suppose one who had always continued blind be told by his guide that after he has advanced so many steps he shall come to the brink of a precipice or be stopped by a wall must not this to him seem very admirable and surprising he cannot conceive how it is possible for mortals to frame such predictions as these which to him would seem as strange and unaccountable as prophesy does to others even they who are blessed with the visive faculty may though familiarity make it less observed find therein sufficient cause of admiration the wonderful art and contrivance wherewith it is adjusted to those ends and purposes for which it was apparently designed the vast extent number and variety of objects that are at once with so much ease and quickness and pleasure suggested by it all these afford subject for much and pleasing speculation and may if any thing give us some glimmering analogous praenotion of things which are placed beyond the certain discovery and comprehension of our present state  cxlix i do not design to trouble my self with drawing corollaries from the doctrine i have hitherto laid down if it bears the test others may so far as they shall think convenient employ their thoughts in extending it farther and applying it to whatever purposes it may be subservient to only i cannot forbear making some inquiry concerning the object of geometry which the subject we have been upon does naturally lead one to we have shown there is no such idea as that of extension in abstract and that there are two kinds of sensible extension and figures which are entirely distinct and heterogeneous from each other now it is natural to inquire which of these is the object of geometry  cl some things there are which at first sight incline one to think geometry conversant about visible extension the constant use of the eyes both in the practical and speculative parts of that science does very much induce us thereto it would without doubt seem odd to a mathematician to go about to convince him the diagrams he saw upon paper were not the figures or even the likeness of the figures which make the subject of the demonstration the contrary being held an unquestionable truth not only by mathematicians but also by those who apply themselves more particularly to the study of logic i mean who consider the nature of science certainty and demonstration it being by them assigned as one reason of the extraordinary clearness and evidence of geometry that in this science the reasonings are free from those inconveniences which attend the use of arbitrary signs the very ideas themselves being copied out and exposed to view upon paper but by the bye how well this agrees with what they likewise assert of abstract ideas being the object of geometrical demonstration i leave to be considered  cli to come to a resolution in this point we need only observe what has been said in sect lix lx lxi where it is shown that visible extensions in themselves are little regarded and have no settled determinate greatness and that men measure altogether by the application of tangible extension to tangible extension all which makes it evident that visible extension and figures are not the object of geometry  clii it is therefore plain that visible figures are of the same use in geometry that words are and the one may as well be accounted the object of that science as the other neither of them being any otherwise concerned therein than as they represent or suggest to the mind the particular tangible figures connected with them there is indeed this difference between the signification of tangible figures by visible figures and of ideas by words that whereas the latter is variable and uncertain depending altogether on the arbitrary appointment of men the former is fixed and immutably the same in all times and places a visible square for instance suggests to the mind the same tangible figure in europe that it does in america hence it is that the voice of the author of nature which speaks to our eyes is not liable to that misinterpretation and ambiguity that languages of humane contrivance are unavoidably subject to  cliii though what has been said may suffice to show what ought to be determined with relalation to the object of geometry i shall nevertheless for the fuller illustration thereof consider the case of an intelligence or unbodied spirit which is supposed to see perfectly well i e to have a clear perception of the proper and immediate objects of sight but to have no sense of touch whether there be any such being in nature or no is beside my purpose to inquire it suffices that the supposition contains no contradiction in it let us now examine what proficiency such a one may be able to make in geometry which speculation will lead us more clearly to see whether the ideas of sight can possibly be the object of that science  cliv first then it is certain the aforesaid intelligence could have no idea of a solid or quantity of three dimensions which follows from its not having any idea of distance we indeed are prone to think that we have by sight the ideas of space and solids which arises from our imagining that we do strictly speaking see distance and some parts of an object at a greater distance than others which has been demonstrated to be the effect of the experience we have had what ideas of touch are connected with such and such ideas attending vision but the intelligence here spoken of is supposed to have no experience of touch he would not therefore judge as we do nor have any idea of distance outness or profundity nor consequently of space or body either immediately or by suggestion whence it is plain he can have no notion of those parts of geometry which relate to the mensuration of solids and their unequal or concave surfaces and contemplate the properties of lines generated by the section of a solid the conceiving of any part whereof is beyond the reach of his faculties  clv farther he cannot comprehend the manner wherein geometers describe a right line or circle the rule and compass with their use being things of which it is impossible he should have any notion nor is it an easier matter for him to conceive the placing of one plain or angle on another in order to prove their equality since that supposes some idea of distance or external space all which makes it evident our pure intelligence could never attain to know so much as the first elements of plain geometry and perhaps upon a nice inquiry it will be found he cannot even have an idea of plain figures any more than he can of solids since some idea of distance is necessary to form the idea of a geometrical plain as will appear to whoever shall reflect a little on it  clvi all that is properly perceived by the visive faculty amounts to no more than colors with their variations and different proportions of light and shade but the perpectual mutability and fleetingness of those immediate objects of sight render them incapable of being managed after the manner of geometrical figures nor is it in any degree useful that they should it is true there are diverse of them perceived at once and more of some and less of others but accurately to compute their magnitude and assign precise determinate proportions between things so variable and inconstant if we suppose it possible to be done must yet be a very trifling and insignificant labor  clvii i must confess it seems to be the opinion of some ingenious men that flat or plain figures are immediate objects of sight though they acknowledge solids are not and this opinion of theirs is grounded on what is observed in painting wherein say they the ideas immediately imprinted on the mind are only of plains variously colored which by a sudden act of the judgment are changed into solids but with a little attention we shall find the plains here mentioned as the immediate objects of sight are not visible but tangible plains for when we say that pictures are plains we mean thereby that they appear to the touch smooth and uniform but then this smoothness and uniformity or in other words this plainness of the picture is not perceived immediately by vision for it appears to the eye various and multiform  clviii from all which we may conclude that plains are no more the immediate object of sight than solids what we strictly see are not solids nor yet plains variously colored they are only diversity of colors and some of these suggest to the mind solids and others plain figures just as they have been experienced to be connected with the one or the other so that we see plains in the same way that we see solids both being equally suggested by the immediate objects of sight which accordingly are themselves denominated plains and solids but though they are called by the same names with the things marked by them they are nevertheless of a nature entirely different as has been demonstrated  clix what has been said is if i mistake not sufficient to decide the question we propose to examine concerning the ability of a pure spirit such as we have described to know geometry it is indeed no easy matter for us to enter precisely into the thoughts of such an intelligence because we cannot without great pains cleverly separate and disintangle in our thoughts the proper objects of sight from those of touch which are connected with them this indeed in a complete degree seems scarce possible to be performed which will not seem strange to us if we consider how hard it is for any one to hear the words of his native language pronounced in his ears without understanding them though he endeavor to disunite the meaning from the sound it will nevertheless intrude into his thoughts and he shall find it extreme difficult if not impossible to put himself exactly in the posture of a foreigner that never learned the language so as to be affected barely with the sounds themselves and not perceive the signification annexed to them by this time i suppose it is clear that neither abstract not visible extension makes the object of geometry the not discerning of which may perhaps have created some difficulty and useless labor in mathematics
