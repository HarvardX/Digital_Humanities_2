the law of retribution  the law of retribution or a serious warning to great britain and her colonies founded on unquestionable examples of gods temporal vengeance against tyrants slaveholders and oppressors  the examples are selected from predictions in the old testament of national judgments which being compared with their actual accomplishment demonstrate the sure word of prophecy as well as the immediate interposition of divine providence to recompense impenitent nations according to their works  by granville sharp  the people of the land have used oppression and exercised robbery and have vexed the poor and needy yea they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully etc therefore have i poured out mine indignation upon them etc their own way have i recompensed upon their heads says the lord god ezekiel xxii         london printed by w richardson for b white at horaces head in fleet street and e and c dilly in the poultry  mdcclxxvi  if thou see the oppression of the poor and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province marvel not at the matter or will for he that is higher than the highest regards etc eccles v    the lord saw it and it displeased him that there was no judgment and he saw that there was no man and wondered that there was no intercessor etc  and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing and was clad with zeal as a cloak according to their deeds accordingly he will repay fury to his adversaries recompense or retribution to his enemies to the islands he will repay recompense etc isa lix  how long will ye judge unjustly and accept the persons of the wicked defend the poor and fatherless do justice to the afflicted and needy deliver the poor and needy rid them out of the hand of the wicked ps lxxxii       remove violence and spoil and execute judgment and justice take away your exactions from my people says the lord god ezekiel xlv    the law of retribution the african slave trade has been publicly supported and encouraged by the legislature of this kingdom for near a century last past so that the monstrous destruction of the human species which is annually occasioned thereby may certainly be esteemed a national crime of the most aggravating kind which according to the usual course of gods providence in the world will probably draw down some exemplary vengeance upon the unrepenting inhabitants of this island and with respect to the british colonies the uncharitable practice of slaveholding especially in the west india islands and the more southern colonies is grown up into a more enormous and destructive oppression whether we view the prodigious multitudes of the oppressed or the unconscionable severity of the oppressors than perhaps ever disgraced any other nation at any one period of time  the several attempts that have lately been made to justify these two branches of abominable national iniquity by the holy scriptures and especially by the permission therein granted to the israelites to purchase and retain slaves among them have induced me to collect from the history of the jews in the several books of holy scripture some plain examples of gods vengeance upon that particular nation expressly for this kind of oppression which i hope will sufficiently prove that slavery was ever detestable in the sight of god and consequently that a speedy reformation is absolutely necessary as well with respect to the african slave trade encouraged in this kingdom as the toleration of slavery in the british american dominions if we mean to entertain the least hope of escaping a severe national retribution which if we may judge by our present civil dissentions and horrid mutual slaughters of national brethren seem ready to burst upon us  i am well aware indeed how very unfashionable it is nowadays to quote scripture when matters of law politics or trade are called in question yet i flatter myself that the following examples drawn from thence are perfectly suitable to my present point and consequently must have weight to convince all persons who sincerely acknowledge the truth of the scriptures that we have the greatest reason to apprehend the infliction of some heavy judgment from almighty god upon these kingdoms on account of the monstrous load of guilt which the british subjects on each side of the atlantic have incurred by the oppressions abovementioned  in some former tracts i have already shown that the servitude which the jews by the mosaic law were permitted to exact of their brethren even when the latter were sold to them was very much limited that they were not to be treated as bond servants if thy brother that dwells by thee be waxen poor and be sold unto thee thou shall not compel him to serve as a bond servant but as an hired servant and as a sojourner he shall be with thee etc levit xxv     0 but as hired servants that the servitude could not lawfully be extended beyond seven years if thou buy an hebrew servant six years he shall serve and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing exodus xxi   unless the servant loved his master and condition and voluntarily demanded and if the servant shall plainly say i love my master my wife and my children i will not go out free etc exodus xxi   thus it is evident that the jews could not acquire any right to the perpetual service of their brethren john or thomas except by virtue of a voluntary contract which is something similar to that clause in the habeas corpus act concerning a contract which i thought myself obliged to acknowledge in my former tract as an exception to the idea of universal freedom in this kingdom but in neither case can the contract for service be implied for in the latter the contract must be in writing and the signing be clearly proved to be a voluntary act without the least suspicion of duress and in the former case it was necessary that the servant should acknowledge in a court of record that he was willing to enter into such a contract for the hebrew servant could not be made a slave unless he would plainly say i love my master etc i will not go out free then says the text his master shall bring him unto the judges which answers to the public acknowledgement necessary in the other case to be made in a court of record for without this the hebrew master had no authority to bore the servants ear in token of bondage exodus xxi       of him to continued in his service and that in every other case it was absolutely unlawful to hold a brother hebrew in slavery  i have likewise shown that under the glorious dispensation of the gospel we are absolutely bound to consider ourselves as citizens of the world that every man whatever without any partial distinction of nation distance or complexion must necessarily be esteemed our neighbor and our brother and that we are absolutely bound in christian duty to entertain a disposition toward all mankind as charitable and benevolent at least as that which was required of the jews under the law toward their national brethren and consequently that it is absolutely unlawful for those who call themselves christians to exact of their brethren i mean their brethren of the universe a more burdensome service than that to which the jews were limited with respect to their brethren of the house of israel and the slavery or involuntary bondage of a brother israelite was absolutely forbid  these premises naturally lead us to consider the severe national judgments which the jews brought upon themselves principally by exceeding these very limitations which i have here specified and the inevitable conclusion to be drawn from these examples is that we are absolutely in danger of the like judgments if we do not immediately put a stop to all similar oppression by national authority because an uncharitable extension of the said limits by those who call themselves christians will certainly be at least as heinous in the sight of god as the oppression of brethren under the law and probably much more so if we consider the purity and benevolence which is required of all men under the gospel dispensation and i have clearly proved i trust that the permission to the israelites to keep bondmen of the heathen or more properly the nations  that were round about them and of the children of the strangers that dwelt among them cannot be extended to any other people whatever except the israelites themselves and that even to them it was only temporary during the dispensation of the mosaic law whilst they possessed the land of canaan the former inhabitants of which  viz the seven abominable nations of palestine expressly mentioned by name in the seventh chapter of deuteronomy where the same heb noun  rendered heathen in the former text is properly expressed by the english word nations the israelites were expressly directed to drive out kill and destroy without pity thine eye shall have no pity upon them deuteronomy vii     and to make no covenant with them thou shall make no covenant with them nor show mercy unto them etc deuteronomy vii    and i hope i have also proved that the remainder of these particular wicked nations thus expressly doomed to destruction were undoubtedly the heathen or nations that dwelt round about the israelites and the children of the strangers whom and whom alone it was lawful to hold in perpetual bondage for otherwise that permission cannot be reconciled to gods positive commands given in the same law to love the stranger the lord your god is god of gods and lord of lords a great god a mighty and a terrible which regards not persons so that this was apparently a general law or rule of conduct toward all persons except the people of those particular nations which were expressly by name condemned to destruction by the hands of the israelites in other parts of the law for their abominable wickedness nor takes reward he does execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow and loves the stranger in giving him food and raiment love ye therefore the stranger and the almighty inculcates a sympathetic concern for the welfare and happiness of strangers by reminding the israelites of their own unhappy situation formerly in a strange country for ye says the text were strangers in the land of egypt deuteronomy x    to    see also levit xix       thou shall love him that is the stranger as thyself for ye were strangers in the land of egypt  national wickedness from the beginning of the world has generally been visited with national punishments and surely no national wickedness can be more heinous in the sight of god than a public toleration of slavery and oppression for tyranny in whatsoever shape it appears must necessarily be esteemed a presumptuous breach of that divine command in which all law is fulfilled gal v    viz thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself levit xix     the histories of all nations indeed afford tremendous examples of gods vengeance against tyrants but no history is so proper to illustrate this subject which now so nearly concerns us as that of the jews for as the knowledge of the divine law was revealed in a more particular manner to that people and to others only through them so the effect even of their disobedience was an exemplary demonstration from time to time of gods vengeance as well as of his mercy for the instruction of all other nations amongst whom they are now dispersed as living monuments of the same to this very day and we have the authority of an apostle   cor x    to assert that all these things happened unto them for ensamples and they are written says he for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come  one of the first and most signal instances of mercy which the almighty was pleased to show that people after they became a nation was the restoring them to their natural freedom from the deplorable slavery in which they were detained by a tyrannical egyptian monarch  the children of israel sighed by reason of the bondage and they cried and their cry came up unto god by reason of the bondage and god heard their groaning etc exodus ii        and the lord said i have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in egypt and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters for i know their sorrows and i am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians exodus iii        and the tremendous judgments whereby this deliverance was effected  viz the plagues of egypt are so many signal examples of gods severe vengeance against slaveholders which ought to be had in everlasting remembrance to warn all nations of the world against the unnatural and baneful practice of keeping slaves  this deliverance from bondage was frequently mentioned even in the words of god himself by his prophets from time to time as i have before remarked  thus says the lord  i e jehovah god of israel i brought you up from egypt and brought you forth out of the house of bondage  more literally from the house of slaves and i delivered you out of the hand of the egyptians and out of the hand of all that oppressed you etc judges vi    i removed his shoulder from the burden his hands were delivered from the pats in like manner there are multitudes of poor people retained in a deplorable bondage even to this day in the potteries of china    thou calledst in trouble and i delivered thee psalm lxxxi      the israelites themselves were also particularly directed to remember this signal exertion of divine mercy and power in the cause of popular freedom remember that thou wast a servant viz a slave in the land of egypt and that the lord thy god brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretchedout arm etc deuteronomy v     it was surely for the moral purpose of stirring up in the israelites a sympathetic concern for the sufferings of the oppressed and more particularly of oppressed strangers that they were so frequently reminded of their own former deplorable condition in slavery and of their miraculous deliverance from thence being expressly referred to their own feelings and remembrance of the cruel foreign tyranny which they themselves had so lately experienced in egypt  thou shall not oppress a stranger for ye know the heart  properly the soul of a stranger seeing ye were strangers in the land of egypt exodus xxiii    god also gave the israelites due warning of the danger of oppression by declaring that he would surely revenge the cause of the injured stranger thou shall neither vex a stranger nor oppress him for ye were strangers in the land of egypt ye shall not afflict any widow or fatherless child if thou afflict them in any wise and they cry at all unto me i will surely hear their cry mark this ye african traders of this island and ye west india and british american slaveholders for ye are all guilty of the like abominable oppressions and god will surely avenge the cause of the oppressed and my wrath shall wax hot and i will kill you with the sword and your wives shall be widows and your children fatherless exodus xxii    to     and have not the careless inhabitants of great britain and her colonies too much reason also to apprehend that the same god who professes to hear the cry of oppressed strangers if they cry at all unto him will sooner or later visit these kingdoms with some signal mark of his displeasure for the notorious oppression of an almost innumerable multitude of poor african strangers that are harrassed and continually wearing out with a most shameful involuntary servitude in the british colonies nay and that by a public toleration under the sanction of laws to which the monarchs of england from time to time by the advice of their privy counselors have given the royal assent and thereby rendered themselves parties in the oppression and it is to be feared partakers of the guilt  let us not forget before it is too late that the almighty has not only declared himself ready to hear the cry of the oppressed stranger but has deigned to add to his glorious name jehovah a brief remembrance of his merciful interposition in behalf of an enslaved nation i am the lord your god or jehovah your god said the almighty to the israelites which brought thee out of the land of egypt out of the house of bondage exodus xx   thus the almighty deliverer from slavery vouchsafed to set his own divine example before the eyes of his redeemed people to excite benevolence and thankfulness and the like remembrance of that glorious redemption from slavery was very frequently repeated from time to time which the scriptures sufficiently testify but alas the israelites profited so little by these wholesome lessons that it became necessary no less frequently to remind them of the dreadful vengeance which would inevitably overtake them for their notorious oppressions of the poor for their unjust exactions of involuntary and unrewarded service and for exceeding the limitations of bondage already recited which the law expressly enjoined  for the oppression of the poor for the sighing of the needy now will i arise says the lord and will set him in safety from him that puffs at him or that would ensnare him psalm xii    the princely prophet isaiah plainly declared to them that their public fasts and outward humiliations were not only vain but even offensive to god while such notorious oppressions continued among them behold said he in the day of your fast you find pleasure and exact all your labors sunt inter quos belgae qui hic intelligunt opera servilia quae a servis and ancillis hoc ipso di rigide exigebantur ut aliis diebus   omnes subjectos vobis affligitis quae lectio says vitringa absque emendatione facile subsistit  and a little afterward he adds prior interpretatio de operibus servorum aut molestis exactionibus subditerum magna se commendat specie estque mihi in eam pronior animus   lviii   and again  is it such a fast that i have chosen a day for a man to afflict his soul is it to bow down his head as a bulrush etc is not this the fast that i have chosen  to loose the bands of wickedness to undo the heavy burdens or rather the bundles of the yoke  plainly referring to the severe and unjust bondage of the poor and to let the oppressed go free and that ye break every yoke  is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry and to bring the poor that are cast out or rather to bring the poor that are reduced or depressed viz as it were by tyrants for so the word  seems more properly to signify in this place to thy house etc compare this with deuteronomy xxiii       thou shall not deliver unto his master the servant which is escaped from his master unto thee he shall dwell with thee even among you in that place which he shall choose in one of thy gates where it likes him best thou shall not oppress him deuteronomy xxiii         and he warned them of the divine justice that would pursue them for their oppression and tyrannical treatment of the poor  the lord stands up to plead and stands to judge the people the lord will enter into judgment with the ancients or senators of his people and the princes thereof for ye have eaten up the vineyard the spoil of the poor is in your houses what mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces and grind the faces of the poor says the lord of hosts isa iii    to     the wicked practices whereby the israelites reduced their poor brethren to slavery are described by the prophet amos hear this o ye that swallow up the needy even to make the poor of the land to fail saying when will the new moon be gone that we may sell corn and the sabbath that we may set forth wheat making the ephah small and the shekel great and falsifying the balances by deceit that we may buy the poor for silver ideo ut ubi solvere non poterunt dent se nobis in servitutem ut mos erat illarum gentium grotius in locum and the needy for a pair of shoes that is comparatively speaking at a most contemptible price whereby we may presume that slavemarkets were not so notoriously established at that time as at present and that the bidders were few though the oppressed were many yea and sell the refuse of the wheat the lord has sworn by the excellency of jacob surely i will never forget any of these works shall not the land tremble for this and every one mourn that dwells therein etc amos viii   to    here is a solemn appeal from god to the human understanding shall not the land tremble for this that is for this same abominable oppression of the poor the buying them for slaves in which great britain and her colonies are infinitely more guilty than the people to whom this appeal was made and shall not the land therefore even our land tremble for this and every one mourn that dwells therein etc surely god will never forget any of these works my countrymen  the prophet jeremiah manifestly alluded to the like deceitful practices of the jews whereby they reduced the poor to slavery when he made a solemn protest against them in the name of god  your sins said he have withholden good things from you for among my people are found wicked men they lay wait as he that sets snares they set a trap they catch men as a cage or coup is full of birds so are their houses full of deceit therefore they are become great and waxen rich they are waxen fat they shine yea they overpass the deeds of the wicked they judge not the cause the cause of the fatherless yet they prosper and the right of the needy do they not judge shall i not visit for these things says the lord shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this etc jer v    to    here again the almighty plainly appeals to the human understanding concerning the propriety or rather the necessity of exerting the divine vengeance against such an oppressive nation  and yet how inconsiderable was the crime of the jewish nation in this respect if compared with the numerous bondage and with the unbounded oppression of the poor negroes in the british colonies have we not therefore just reason to fear that god will visit for these things does not the word of god which cannot change appeal to us my countrymen as well as to the jews  shall not my soul says the lord be avenged on such a nation as this  the same prophet in the next chapter declares the divine vengeance to be at hand  for thus has the lord of hosts said  hew ye down trees and cast a mount against jerusalem this is the city to be visited she is wholly oppression in the midst of her as a fountain casts out her waters so she casts out her wickedness violence and spoil is heard in her before me continually is grief and wounds be thou instructed o jerusalem lest my soul depart from thee lest i make thee desolate a land not inhabited jer vi   to    but in vain were the warnings of the prophet till the judgments themselves began to appear in all the horrors of a hopeless war which began in the ninth year and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign in the tenth month in the tenth day of the month that nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came he and all his host against jerusalem and pitched against it and they built forts against it round about   kings xxv    in the ninth year of zedekiah king of judah in the tenth month came nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and all his army against jerusalem and they besieged it etc jer xxxix   see also chap lii ver     of king zedekiahs reign notwithstanding that the monarch had previously rendered himself secure as he thought by his military preparations in sending for horses and men from egypt to complete his standing army and had also made pharaoh another presumptuous military tyrant his ally which encouraged him to break his oath and covenant with the king of babylon  but when nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion and all the people fought against jerusalem and against all the cities thereof  then god ordered his prophet to remind zedekiah of that dreadful vengeance defeat and captivity which had so often before been denounced as the necessary consequences of oppression and injustice  thus says the lord the god of israel  viz to jeremiah go and speak to zedekiah king of judah and tell him thus says the lord behold i will give this city into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall burn it with fire and thou shall not escape out of his hand but shall surely be taken and delivered into his hand and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of babylon and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth and thou shall go to babylon etc jer xxxiv   to    the impending vengeance being then become visible and consequently more tremendous by the near approach of the babylonian army that irresistible instrument in the hand of god by which the jews had so often been subdued the kings stubborn heart began to relent and his military confidence to forsake him which had before encouraged his injustice his firmness in worldly politics was shaken and yielded to a sense of guilt it was upon this return of conscience and right reason that zedekiah sent two messengers passur and zephaniah to jeremiah saying enquire i pray thee of the lord for us for nebuchadnezzar king of babylon makes war against us if so be the lord will deal with us according to all his wondrous works that he may go up from us etc see chap xxi ver   and   but a very unwelcome answer was given to the messengers to be returned to their monarch for the prophet confirmed all the heavy judgments then said jeremiah unto them thus shall ye say to zedekiah thus says the lord god of israel behold i will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands wherewith ye fight against the king of babylon and against the chaldeans which besiege you without the walls and i will bring them into the midst of this city and i myself will fight against you with an outstretched arm and with a strong arm even in anger and in fury and in great wrath and i will smite the inhabitants of this city both man and beast they shall die of a great pestilence and afterward says the lord i will deliver zedekiah king of judah and his servants and the people and such as are left in this city from the pestilence from the sword and from the famine into the hand of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those that seek their life and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword he shall not spare them neither have pity nor have mercy jer xxi   to     which had before been denounced as well against the king expressly by name as against the city and its iniquitous inhabitants whose notorious oppressions were now to be recompensed upon their own heads measure for measure  now is the end come upon thee and i will send mine anger upon thee and will judge thee according to thy ways and will recompense upon thee all thine abominations etc ezekiel vii   see also the  th  th and  th verses to the same effect and afterward in the   th verse one of the principal causes of gods vengeance is mentioned  violence said the prophet is risen up into a rod of wickedness none of them shall remain nor of their multitude nor of any of theirs neither shall there be wailing for them the time is come the day draws near etc  and again in the   d verse  make a chain said the prophet for the land is full of bloody crimes and the city is full of violence wherefore i will bring the worst of the heathen and they shall possess their houses etc  destruction comes and they shall seek peace and there shall be none mischief shall come upon mischief and rumor shall be upon rumor etc  the king shall mourn and the prince shall be clothed with desolation and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled i will do unto them after their own way and according to their deserts or rather their own judgments will i judge them and they shall know that i am the lord  again in the   th chapter the same reason is clearly assigned for the pouring out of gods vengeance  say unto the people of the land thus says the lord god of the inhabitants of jerusalem and of the land of israel they shall eat their bread with carefulness and drink their water with astonishment that her land may be desolate from all that is therein because of the violence of them that dwell therein ezekiel xii    the nature of this baneful violence which occasioned their destruction is more particularly described by the same prophet in chap xxii ver    in the midst of thee still speaking of jerusalem have they dealt by oppression with the stranger mark this ye british slavedealers and slaveholders in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow thou have despised mine holy things and have profaned my sabbaths in thee are men that carry tales to shed blood and in thee they eat upon the mountains in the midst of thee they commit lewdness etc  one has committed abomination with his neighbors wife and another has lewdly defiled his daughterinlaw etc  in thee have they taken gifts to shed blood thou have taken usury and increase and thou have greedily gained of thy neighbors by extortion and have forgotten me says the lord god behold therefore i have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou have made and at thy blood which has been in the midst of thee etc ezekiel xxii   etc  oh that the subjects of the british empire would seriously compare these crimes with their own practices they would then surely be sensible of their danger and that they have reason to expect the like or rather much heavier judgments than those denounced against the jews for besides the notorious adulteries and other acts of lewdness which many amongst us from the frequency of such crimes commit even without shame or remorse we have far exceeded the guilt of the jews i fear in many of the other points also which provoked the vengeance of the almighty against them what violence amongst the jews before their captivity was ever risen up into so destructive a rod of wickedness  as the african slave trade now carried on chiefly by our liverpool and bristol merchants what bloody crime among the jews was more notorious and more wickedly premeditated than the late invasion and conquest of the poor innocent carribees at st vincents and what nation has dealt by oppression with the stranger so generally so inhumanly and in so great a degree as our british american slaveholders  have we not ample reason to expect that the same tremendous decree will in gods justice be fulfilled upon these kingdoms  destruction comes and they shall seek peace and there shall be none mischief shall come upon mischief and rumor upon rumor etc etc etc  i will do unto them after their own way and according to their own judgments will i judge them etc  nevertheless god was pleased to offer the jews a choice in their fate  either to forsake their wicked king who had forfeited all right to govern by his neglect of justice and natural right and to fall away to the kings enemies the chaldeans or else to perish miserably in the city and partake of it is destruction  and unto this people said god to the prophet jeremiah thou shall say thus says the lord behold i set before you the way of life and the way of death he that abides in this city shall die by the sword and by the famine and by the pestilence but he that goes out and falls to the chaldeans that besiege you he shall live and his life shall be unto him for a prey etc jer xxi      the prophet however was directed to add to his message a word of advice to the king and court which shows that a seasonable repentance might even then have saved the state and turned away the impending vengeance  it was such advice too as every other monarch who tolerates any unnatural bondage or oppression in his dominions ought seriously to consider because the event proved it to be the best means of averting gods anger if the king had but persevered in it  and touching the house of the king of judah continued the prophet say  hear ye the word of the lord o house of david  thus says the lord execute judgment in the morning and deliver him that is spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor lest my fury go out like fire and burn that none can quench it because of the evil of your doings jer xxi    this is a manifest declaration that the neglect of justice and right and the toleration of oppression were the principal causes of gods heavy vengeance against that royal house  the same advice was by gods command repeated by the prophet to the king himself in his palace see the next chapter  thus says the lord go down to the house of the king of judah and speak there this word and say hear the word of the lord o king of judah that fittest upon the throne of david thou and thy servants and thy people that enter in by these gates that is all persons whatever that enter in by the palacegates plainly including the whole court before whom the prophet was to deliver his message thus says the lord execute ye judgment and righteousness and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor and do no wrong do no violence to the stranger and what wrong or violence to the stranger can be more oppressive than that of detaining him in an involuntary servitude without wages in a miserable wretched bondage worse than that of brute beasts    etc  for if ye do this thing indeed that is if ye will execute judgment and righteousness deliver the oppressed etc then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of david or rather that sit i e reign for david upon his throne riding in chariots and on horses he and his servants and his people that is the court should continue and prosper but if ye will not hear these words i swear by myself says the lord  i e jehovah that this house  i e the palace shall become a desolation jer xxii   to   so that the whole court were as much interested to promote a speedy reformation as the king himself thus it is plain that the king and court had also a choice given them of life and death as well as the people and consequently that the judgments denounced were only conditional in case the warning was neglected for it is manifest that god mercifully tendered to them even at the eve of their destruction a continuance of the monarchy viz kings sitting upon the throne of david if they would but resolve to execute judgment and righteousness to deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor and to do no wrong no violence to the stranger etc but the prophet also added much more advice to the king and his court though he was not  made of the kings council when a similar warning was given by a former prophet to a wicked and inconsiderate predecessor of zedekiah concerning gods impending vengeance for his misconduct the haughty monarch puffed up with vain notions of his royal importance arrogantly imposed silence on the prophet because he had undertaken the office of an adviser or counselor to the king without the etiquette or formality of a court appointment  art thou made of the kings council said the monarch forbear why should thou be smitten  upon which the prophet forbore indeed to reason with him but immediately pronounced upon him the severe sentence of gods condemnation saying i know that god has determined to destroy thee because thou have done this and have not hearkened unto my counsel and it is remarkable that after rejecting the counsel of god the very next counsel which this imperious monarch was pleased to adopt was attended with the most dangerous and humiliating consequences both to king and kingdom that could possibly have happened nothing less than the delivery of both into the absolute power of their enemies for after he had silenced the prophet then says the text amaziah king of judah took advice and sent to joash the son of jehoahaz the son of jehu king of israel saying come let us see one another in the face  the war was unjust and unreasonable and providentially the king and his wicked advisers were punished by the effects of their own unprincipled counsel see   chronicles xxv           for he boldly warned the monarch by the tremendous examples of gods judgments upon three of his immediate predecessors in the kingdom two of whom were his own brothers the sons of king josiah and the third his own nephew whom he immediately succeeded they were all particularly mentioned by him in the proper order of their respective reigns as we find by the copy of his message or remonstrance preserved in the collection of his prophecies and throughout the said remonstrance frequent allusions are made to the principal causes of the failure and destruction of each of them which afford a most striking and interesting lesson to kings and governors in general but it must have been more particularly affecting to zedekiah if we consider his critical situation at the time the message was delivered to him and that the examples of vengeance to which the prophet referred him were actually accomplished in the persons of his nearest relations and predecessors who were successively deprived of their royal dignity and carried away in chains into a slavish captivity the very fate which the prophet assured him was to be his own  but before i recite the remainder of gods message to the court of zedekiah it will be necessary for me to give some general account of that monarch and of his immediate predecessors in order that the remonstrance in which they are all distinctly mentioned may be more easily understood by the generality of readers it will likewise be necessary for me to prove that the whole   d chapter of jeremiah is included in that message or remonstrance which the prophet was then to deliver in the presence of the whole court of zedekiah and i propose to insert also some remarks as they occur concerning the prophet himself and the order of time in which he delivered the several tremendous predictions of gods vengeance against these wicked princes  zedekiah was the son of that excellent prince josiah king of judah on whose account expressly the dreadful vengeance due to that wicked nation was postponed for several years viz till after his death  the scriptures mention four sons of king josiah viz the firstborn johanan or john the second jehoiakim the third zedekiah and the fourth shallum   chronicles iii     what became of the eldest son johanan or john is not recorded  this johanan says bishop patrick is thought by many to be the same with jehoahaz who succeeded josiah in the throne but he meaning jehoahaz was not his firstborn being but twentythree years old when the people made him king and after three months time his brother being put in his place is said to be twentyfive years old   kings xxiii       petavius continues the bishop has said a great deal about this in his annotations upon epiphanius ad haeres epicur p    but after all says the learned bishop i take the truth to be that johanan was his eldest son but died before his father and therefore is not mentioned in the book of kings as continues he jehoahaz is not mentioned here being made king by the people of the land and presently dethroned  in the latter part of this remark however the worthy bishop is apparently mistaken for the same king who was sometimes called jehoahaz is certainly mentioned in that very text   chronicles iii    on which the bishop made this remark though mentioned indeed under a different name viz shallum    but all the others ascended the throne of david and first of all the youngest son shallum whom on the death of king josiah the people of the land took and as it seems without regard to seniority made him king in his fathers stead in jerusalem   chronicles xxxvi   in this text shallum is called jehoahaz which perhaps was his original or proper name and the other name shallum only a surname signifying peace given him probably by the people at his coronation and in remembrance of the peace and general tranquillity during the greatest part of his fathers reign but the great and learned archbishop usher just reversed this supposition for he was of opinion that shallum  eum enim    annos natum senioribus fratribus posthabitis populus regem patris loco constituit   reg xxiii  0    shallumi nomine ut videtur melioris ominis causa in aliud mutato quod commune illud ei fuisset cum shallumo jabeshi filio qui unico tantum mense regno potitus a manahemo est occisus etc ad a m      p       was the proper name and jehoahaz only the surname  nevertheless in defense of what i have ventured to mention as my own opinion i must remark that in the list of king josiahs sons where shallum is mentioned with the rest of his brothers  viz   chronicles iii    no less than two of his brothers out of three are mentioned only by the surnames which were given them when they began to reign and the third brother there mentioned or rather the first of them johanan never reigned and therefore probably had no surname to distinguish him like the rest but the other two who actually ascended the throne of david were mentioned by their surnames only viz jehoiakim  jehovikim signifying jehovah will establish and zedekiah  tsadokjehov signifying the righteousness of jehovah for their proper names were eliakim   kings xxiii    and mattaniah   kings xxiv    and therefore it is very natural to conclude that the name of the only remaining brother who actually reigned and is mentioned in the same text  viz shallum signifying peace is likewise a surname as well as the other two mentioned before him who received the names by which they are distinguished in that text when they were first appointed to the throne of judah     the reign of shallum alias jehoahaz jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign and he reigned three months in jerusalem and his mothers name was hamutal the daughter of jeremiah of libnah and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord according to all that his fathers had done   kings xxiii       was only three months for he regarded not the eternal laws of god and thereby drew down the divine vengeance upon himself by the hand of pharaohneco who deposed him at jerusalem and the king of egypt put him down at jerusalem and condemned the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold   chronicles xxxvi     chronicles xxxvi   and afterward put him in bands at riblah riblah was the fatal place where king zedekiah was afterward judged and condemned by the king of babylon and where his sons were slain before his eyes jer lii   the text also informs us that he the king of babylon slew also all the princes of judah in riblah jer lii  0 there is something very remarkable in the meaning of these names riblah and hamath when compared with the dreadful vengeance executed therein riblah  was capable of being interpreted though it likewise has a different meaning as follows viz rixa  aut jurgium inveteratum vel conturbatum sive jurgium defluens see the interpretation of scripture names annexed to the london polyglot vol vi and hamath  ira vel indignatio aut calor etc ibid that is the city of strife or severe chiding in the land of wrath or fiery indignation now it must appear very remarkable i say if we consider the interpretation of which these names are capable that god should incline two foreign conquerors who had no connection with each other but on the contrary were mortal enemies to execute his vengeance upon different kings of judah exactly at the same place viz the city of strife in the land of wrath insomuch that one would suppose these names to be given afterward in remembrance of gods severe vengeance already executed therein and yet we find they were the ancient names of those places mentioned in moses account of the israelitish boundary numb xxxiv      and though the names are really capable of bearing a different and more favorable interpretation yet to the jews who were nice observers concerning the real meaning of names the possibility of interpreting the names of these fatal places in the awful sense which i have mentioned must render the accomplishment of gods vengeance therein much more striking and remarkable   in the land of hamath that he might not reign in jerusalem   kings xxiii    and pharaohnechoh put him in bands at riblah in the land of hamath that he might not reign in jerusalem etc   kings xxiii    there being probably some reason to apprehend that he would attempt to supplant his elder brother eliakim whom the egyptian conqueror had thought proper to set up in his stead upon the throne of david and therefore to secure the newestablished monarch he not only put shallum in bands but also carried him away with him into captivity in egypt where he died and pharaohnechoh made eliakim the son of josiah king in the room of josiah his father and turned his name to jehoiakim and took jehoahaz away and he came to egypt and he died there   kings xxiii      thus eliakim through the mercy of god to the house of david was raised to the throne and kingdom of his ancestors even by a foreign enemy who also changed his name that the providence of god might be more apparent in the revolution from eliakim  signifying god will establish to jehoiakim signifying as i have before remarked jehovah will establish whereby it is manifest that even a heathen monarch took pains to remind the new king of judah of his dependence on jehovah the god of israel whose laws and religion of course we may presume were likewise reestablished in judea by the same foreign authority for it would have been absurd in the egyptian monarch to have changed the name of his royal vassal to another name more particularly testifying a belief in jehovah the true god of israel if he did not mean thereby to keep the jewish king in constant remembrance of the national profession of law and religion by the sacred name of the great author of them  the same remarkable change in the name of a future king of judah was made also by another foreign and heathen conqueror afterward in honor of the eternal jehovah so that it was manifestly the providence of god which inclined these two great enemies of the jewish state though they were also mortal enemies to each other i mean pharaoh and nebuchadnezzar to pursue exactly the same method in restoring the scepter of judah to the house of david and in declaring the establishment of the national law and religion by putting a respectful memorial of the sacred name of jehovah upon the newraised monarchs  in the beginning of jehoiakims reign though judea and all syria were then under the egyptian empire the prophet jeremiah in his   th chapter  in the beginning of the reign of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah came this word unto jeremiah from the lord saying thus says the lord or the lord said to me make ye bonds and yokes and put them upon thy neck and send them to the king of edom etc the learned dr lowth prebendary of winchester in      in his commentary on this place supposes that the name of jehoiakim has crept into the text etc instead of zedekiah this emendation says he is confirmed by comparing this verse with the  d   th and  0th verses of this chapter and with the beginning of the next  but these verses however are far from confirming the proposed emendation all that can properly be said of them in this respect is that they have occasioned in some writers the supposition of an error in the text which has been very well answered by others but there is a better evidence in favor of the doctors supposition than what he has mentioned because the latter really contains no difficulty if the  d and  th verses be considered as prophecies these things says the learned lightfoot are to be understood to be spoken prophetically concerning zedekiah as well as concerning nebuchadnezzars sons for the lord by the prophet foretells that nebuchadnezzar should reign and his son and grandchilde after him and therefore must the prophet presently make yokes and bonds and put them of his own neck in token of judahs subjection which indeed begun in the very next year and he foretells us withal that zedekiah should reign and that diverse kings should send messengers to him and by them should jeremy send those yokes to those kings etc harmony of the old testament p     and   0   of the future reigns of zedekiah and nebuchadnezzar but the evidence which he has not mentioned leaves much more room for the supposition of a various reading in the text for the syriac version has really the reading which that learned gentleman supposes to be the true one viz  in the beginning of the reign of tsedekia instead of in the beginning of the reign of jehoiakim this evidence certainly proves either that the hebrew copy from which the version was made had really the reading supposed by dr lowth or else that the translator himself thought like dr lowth that the word jehoiakim had crept into the text instead of zedekiah and therefore was willing to correct the supposed error in his new version and as the latter is neither impossible nor improbable the evidence of the syriac version must by no means be admitted to invalidate the present hebrew reading especially as the latter is confirmed not only by all the ancient hebrew manuscripts that have hitherto been collated but also by the targum of jonathan who flourished  00 years before the destruction of the second temple as bishop walton relates floruit hic centum annis ante templi secundi vastationem ut habetur in talm fract de sabbato c    in biblia polyglotta prolegom p     so that his translation is older than the oldest syriac version which is sufficiently proved in the prolegomena to the polyglott bible by the same learned bishop the whole verse is wanting in the greek version so that no evidence can be drawn from thence   foretold the universal empire of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon even before that great warrior was king of babylon which was not till the latter end of the third year of jehoiakim for part of the third and part of the fourth years of jehoiakim were included in the first year of nebuchadnezzar compare dan i   with jer xxv   this was the earliest computation there being two of nebuchadnezzars reign for dean prideaux remarks that daniel begins his computation from the time that nebuchadnezzar was sent from babylon by his father on this expedition for he is speaking of nebuchadnezzars success in recovering syria and palestine from pharaohnechoh which says he was in the latter end of the third year of jehoiakim etc see connections part i p    but according to the babylonians his reign is not reckoned to begin till after his fathers death which happened two years afterward and both computations being found in scripture it is necessary to say so much here for the reconciling of them ibid p  0   his father nabopollasar who was also called nebuchodonosor the learned archbishop usher shows that nabuchadonosor was a name given to saosduchinus the successor of esarhaddon in the assyrian and babylonian empire and that he was the nabuchadonosor mentioned in the book of judith see his annals under the years of the world      and      that chynaladan called also sarac succeeded this nabuchadonosor in the empire a m      that nabopollasar the father of nebuchadnezzar who was commander in chief of his forces rebelled against his master sarac and jointly with asstyages called also assuerus king of the medes conquered sarac and took nineveh and it seems that nabopollasar at that time had assumed the name of nabuchadonosor the great ancestor of his master for according to archbishop usher nabopollasar is mentioned under that name in the book of tobit a m      viz nabopollasarus babylonius a saraco sive chynaladano assyriorum and chaldaeorum rege praefectus exercitui the example should warn monarchs against the keeping of great standing armies and astyages a patre cyaxare mediae satrapa constitutus affinitatem ineuntes amyiti astyagis filia nebucadnesari filio nabopollasari desponsata junctis vitibus niniven and in ea saracum regem expugnant quemadmodum ex alexandri polyhistoris fragmento a cedreno qui illud citat minime intellecto colligimus quomodo and in fine graeci tobiti legimus coepisse niniven nabuchodonosorum sive nabopollasarum and assuerum sive astyagen assueri quoque nomine danielis ix   appellatum superstite adhuc tobia juniore qui capta samaria a salmanasare in assyriam cum patre deportatus annis     vel    ut habet latina ex chaldaico expressa editio vixisse dicitur etc  so that tobit had the satisfaction to see gods vengeance executed upon that mighty instrument of gods wrath the assyrian empire which had enslaved and carried away his countrymen the israelites from their an cient inheritance   being still alive the prophet was directed to make bonds and yokes and put them upon his own neck and to send them afterward to the kings of several neighboring nations with a most awful message from god concerning the rising power of the babylonian monarch  and now said the prophet in the name of the lord or jehovah of hosts the god of israel see ver   have i given all these lands into the hand of nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon my servant etc  and all nations many of whom are expressly mentioned in the third verse shall serve him and his son and his sons son until the very time of his land come for the empire continued for three lives or successions until the babylonian measure of iniquity and oppression was fulfilled in the reign of belthazar the several histories cited by the learned grotius in the   th sect of his  d book de veritate religionis christianae concerning the chaldean monarchs are by no means well chosen for the laudable purpose he intended and he refers the reader also to scaliger whose hypothesis concerning those monarchs is clogged with insurmountable difficulties see universal history vol iv p     but dean prideaux has clearly proved that nabonadius the last king of babylon called labynetus by herodotus was the same with him that in scripture is called belshazzar and that he was the son of evilmerodach by nitocris his queen and so sons son to nebuchadnezzar and that whereas he is called the son of nebuchadnezzar in the  th chapter of daniel and nebuchadnezzar is there called his father this is to be understood in the large sense wherein any ancestor upward is often called father and any descendant down ward son according to the usual style of scripture connection of the old and new testaments part i p     see also drlowths comment on jeremiah    when the medes and persians were to retaliate upon them the hard slavery of israel and then continues the prophet many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him etc jer xxvii     that is they shall enslave his people in the same manner that he and his two successors enslaved and oppressed other nations rendering slavery for slavery  in the same chapter zedekiah is also mentioned by name as king of judah in the beginning of the reign of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah came this word unto jeremiah from the lord saying thus says the lord to me make ye bonds and yokes and put them upon thy neck and send them to the king of edom and to the king of moab etc  by the hand of the messengers which come to jerusalem unto zedekiah king of judah etc jer xxvii   to   the learned archbishop of armagh has taken notice of this chapter as a prophecy  in principio etiam regni jehoiakimi jeremias praedixisse dicitur sedekiam regem judae futurum and nebucadnesarem regem babyloniae eumque gentes finitimas dominatui suo subjecturum for which he refers to this   th chapter of jeremiah from the  st to the   th verse a m        several years before he received the name of zedekiah so that neither he himself whose proper name was mattaniah nor any other person could possibly know in the beginning of jehoiakims reign what particular person was then signified by the name of zedekiah for even nebuchadnezzar himself who afterward gave him that name was not king of babylon when the prophecy was delivered as i have already remarked but after this foreign conqueror had really appointed a king of judah and given him the name of zedekiah the very name foretold by the prophet such an extraordinary circumstance would add unquestionable authority to the truth of jeremiahs mission and would render zedekiah and his courtiers inexcusable as they really were for rejecting the earnest and repeated remonstrances of that prophet if this probable confirmation of the word of prophecy be duly considered it will add much to the weight of the observations which i have made in a preceding note concerning the truth of the hebrew text in the  st verse of this chapter     this timely prediction therefore in the reign of jehoiakim with the internal proofs which it contained concerning the necessity of zedekiahs submission to the babylonian yoke seems to have been absolutely necessary to enable the prophet to confute the many false prophets diviners dreamers etc see  th verse who were afterward in zedekiahs reign publicly employed to excite the people to shake off the babylonian yoke  the prophet was also forewarned in the beginning of jehoiakims reign as the same chapter testifies that the kings of edom moab ammon tire and zidon would send messengers to a zedekiah king of judah all which kings as grotius remarks omnes enim hi reges subjugati a nebuchadonosoro vide infra xlviiixlix comment on the  d verse annot ad vet test p       were subdued by nebuchadnezzar and therefore it is not improbable that the said messengers or ambassadors were sent to zedekiah for the purpose of forming a league against the babylonian nempe ut eum sollicitarent says grotius ad defectionem a chaldaeo de qua vide   paral xxxvi    ibid p      their business says the learned dr lowth was either to congratulate zedekiah upon his accession to the throne or else to engage him in a league against the king of babylon comment on jerem p       power the public declarations of the false prophets abovementioned and the actual rebellion soon afterward of zedekiah himself renders the said supposition about the business of the messengers very probable so that if this singular state of affairs be considered the sending at such a seasonable time to the several neighboring kings by the return of their ambassadors the yokes which had been worn by jeremiah together with gods awful message that he would punish that nation which will not serve nebuchadnezzar and put their neck under his yoke see ver   and it shall come to pass that the nation and kingdom which will not serve the same nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon and that will not put their nick under the yoke of the king of babylon that nation will i punish says the lord with the sword with the famine and with the pestilence until i have consumed them by his hand jer xxvii    must needs strike these heathen monarchs if they were not entirely abandoned in their principles with fear and reverence especially as their ambassadors would hear at jerusalem that the divine message concerning the yokes then sent had been revealed to the prophet long before thirteen or fourteen years in the beginning of jehoiakims reign in token of which the prophet had worn yokes upon his own neck see chap xxviii ver  0       and that no less than three circumstances of that extraordinary revelation were now already fulfilled the prophet having not only foretold the reign of nebuchadnezzar and the reign of zedekiah  a name not applicable to zedekiah himself till the babylonian conqueror thought proper to give it him so that no worldly prudence could foresee such an event but had also foretold the very circumstance in which they themselves were concerned viz that messengers should be sent to this zedekiah by such and such kings  in what year these messengers or ambassadors really arrived at jerusalem or returned from thence does not appear but as the yokes were first of all to be put upon the prophets own neck before he was to send them to the kings compare the  d and  d verses and as it appears that he really wore such a wooden yoke as a sign against them in the temple so late as the  th year of zedekiah when a false prophet took it from his neck and broke it and thereby occasioned a further command respecting those kings viz that the prophet should make for them yokes of iron thus says the lord thou hananiah have broken the yokes of wood but thou jeremiah shall make for them yokes of iron jer xxviii       it seems most probable that the wooden yokes first ordered had not then been sent to them and consequently that the messengers of those kings had not as yet arrived at jerusalem for undoubtedly the prophet would obey the divine command as soon as he had the proper opportunity of doing so and as zedekiah went to babylon in the same year see jer li    it is likely the messengers did not arrive nor he rebel till the year following nevertheless in that year the fourth of zedekiah the prophet declared the message to zedekiah himself which he had before been charged to send to the other kings  i spoke also says he in chapter xxvii ver    to zedekiah king of judah according to all these words that is according to all these words which precede in the same chapter respecting the yokes and which had been revealed in the reign of jehoiakim saying bring your necks under the yoke of the king of babylon and serve him and his people and live why will ye die thou and thy people by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence as the lord has spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of babylon etc see ver    and    the almighty had laid upon all the other nations of palestine and syria the same fatal necessity either to submit to a foreign yoke or die so that we have here a very remarkable example of gods vengeance and retribution upon several wicked and corrupt nations which regarded not the eternal laws of god  they must either serve the king of babylon or be destroyed  there was no alternative  be destroyed by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence as the lord has spoken compare the   th verse with the  th until i have consumed them by his hand that is by the hand of the babylonian conqueror the appointed instrument of gods temporal vengeance  and the god of armies  has in all ages raised up some powerful scourges of this kind to punish wicked and ungrateful nations with fire and sword and to reduce them to an unnatural bondage on account of national iniquities  even the present state of mankind affords some melancholy proofs of this how many nations now subsisting in the world have forfeited their natural liberty and are now sitting under the iron yokes of unnatural arbitrary governments subjected to the will and pleasure of their respective sovereigns instead of law and if the particular history of any or perhaps all of these nations be carefully examined it will not i believe be found that any of them were ever reduced to such a deplorable state of national misery till by national wickedness and public contempt of gods eternal laws they had rendered a national retribution strictly necessary according to the unerring rules of eternal justice all hopes therefore of redress to these enslaved nations must be vain without a sincere reformation of manners in each nation respectively and without public and most earnest national or general endeavors to obtain reconciliation and forgiveness from the king of kings as nothing but a strict obedience to his laws can render any nation truly free jeremiah made the same declaration also to the priests and people that he had made to the king  also i spoke says he to the priests and to all the people saying thus says the lord hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you saying behold the vessels of the lords house shall now shortly be brought again from babylon for they prophesy a lie these lying prophets were probably bribed to favor the proposed league against babylon as some other wicked prophets had been on former occasions according to the testimony of the prophet micah  and the prophets thereof speaking of jerusalem  divine sor money micah iii    and nehemiah also mentions a prophet one shemaiah who was hired to prophesy against him  for tobiah and sanballat had hired him nehem vi  0 to      unto you hearken not unto them serve the king of babylon and live wherefore should this city be laid waste jer xxvii        the wicked prophets who thus misled the people with lies presumed nevertheless to use the sacred name of jehovah  they prophesy a lie unto you for i have not sent them says the lord jehovah yet they prophesy a lie in my name etc jer xxvii          as if they had really declared the will of god so that the true prophet had need not only of all those unquestionable proofs of his divine mission which i have already mentioned but even of other proofs also to enable him to oppose the lying prophets who pretended to speak in the name of jehovah as well as himself for in the same year that is in the fourth of zedekiah one of these wicked prophets hananiah the son of azur the prophet which was of gibeon gibeon was the place where the tabernacle formerly stood for many years   chronicles xxi      kings iii   and was therefore an ancient seat of the true prophets  such as azur the father of this hananiah probably was so that as hananiah and the other false prophets also pretended to prophesy in the sacred name of jehevah they would be very liable to gain credit with the people especially as they told them such things as most flattered the national inclination of those times viz to be free from the babylonian yoke    took the yoke from off the prophet jeremiahs neck and brake it and hananiah spoke in the temple in the presence of all the people saying thus says the lord even so will i break the yoke of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years jer xxviii    0    upon which it seems the prophet jeremiah was directed by god to reprove hananiah with a severe sentence for he not only declared that yokes of iron should be substituted instead of the yokes of wood then the word of the lord came unto jeremiah the prophet after that hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet jeremiah saying go and tell hananiah saying thus says the lord thou have broken the yokes of wood but thou shall make for them yokes of iron jer xxviii          which hananiah had broken as i before remarked but he also pointed out the lying prophet himself to the public observation as a notable and undeniable token that the prophecies of jeremiah were of divine authority  hear now hananiah said the true prophet the lord i e jehovah has not sent thee but thou make this people to trust in a lie therefore thus says the lord  behold i will cast thee forth from the face of the earth this year thou shall die because thou have taught rebellion against the lord so hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month jer xxviii        that is he died exactly two months after the prediction which was made in the fifth month of the fourth year of zedekiah such evidence added to the former clear tokens of authenticity which this prophecy of the yokes carried with it must render zedekiah and his courtiers totally inexcusable for neglecting the divine warning and relying upon false prophets  thus the propriety of considering the former part of the   th chapter as a revelation in the time of jehoiakim agreeable to the testimony of the hebrew text is rendered apparent by the particular advantages which such a prior revelation would afterward give to the true prophet when he had to oppose the pretended prophecies delivered in the fourth year of zedekiah and the remaining part of the   th chapter from the   th verse wherein the prophet mentions his personal address to zedekiah must necessarily be attributed to a future time alia est sectio says grotius upon this verse and ad aliud tempus pertinens sed argumento conjuncta cum superiori grot annot ad vet test    which in the following chapter the   th is expressly declared to have been in the fourth year of zedekiah chap xxviii and it came to pass the same year in the beginning of the reign of zedekiah king of judah in the fourth year and in the fifth month that hananiah etc     in the beginning also of jehoiakims reign the prophet jeremiah was seized by the priests and the people in the temple for denouncing gods vengeance against the nation the temple also on account of the national wickedness and the city in the beginning of the reign of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah came this word from the lord saying thus says the lord stand in the court of the lords house and speak unto all the cities of judah which come to worship in the lords house all the words that i command thee to speak unto them diminish not a word if so be they will hearken and turn every man from his evil way that i may repent me of the evil which i purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings this is gods law of retribution evil for evil measure for measure which nothing but repentance and conformity to gods laws could avert and thou shall say unto them thus faith the lord if ye will not hearken to me to walk in my law which i have set before you to hearken to the words of my servants the prophets whom i sent unto you both rising up early and sending them but ye have not hearkened then will i make this house like shiloh shiloh was probably desolate from the time of elis death when the ark was taken by the philistines for the old tabernacle made by moses was afterward pitched on the high place at gibeon   chronicles xxi    and continued there till the time of solomon when the temple was built   chronicles i   the removal was probably made by samuel whose house was at rama as also the altat which he built   samuel vii    and rama was in the neighborhood of gibeon gibeah or geba which if not the same place with rama which also signifies a high place was at least adjoining to it as they are frequently mentioned together in scripture see   samuel xxii   ezra ii    nehem vii  0 isa x    hosea v    and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth so the priests and the prophets and all the people heard jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the lord jer xxvi      thus it is manifest that the public exercise of the national religion agreeable to the national law was continued even in the beginning of jehoiakims reign though he was set up and ruled under the authority of a foreign heathen monarch pharaohneco for the  d verse testifies that the people out of all the cities of judah came to worship in the lords house    and was arraigned and tried for it as for a capital offense before the princes and all the congregation  upon the trial the prophet persisted in his former declaration but at the same time assured them of mercy and reconciliation in case they would but repent and reform so that it was absolutely in their own power through the mercy of god to have averted the impending vengeance therefore now said the prophet amend your ways and your doings and obey the voice of the lord your god and then he adds the conditional assurance of peace and the lord said the prophet will repent him of the evil that he has pronounced against you to this the prophet added a short remonstrance respecting his own case  as for me says he i am in your hand do with me as seems good and meet unto you but know ye for certain that if ye put me to death ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city and upon the inhabitants thereof for of a truth the lord has sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears jer xxvi       whereupon he was acquitted and dismissed for some of the elders cited clear precedents from the history of former times concerning the legality of declaring gods vengeance against national wickedness but though this prudent judgment of the court of justice saved jeremiah for that time yet it did not prevent the wicked monarch jehoiakim from murdering the prophets colleague urijah who likewise prophesied against the city and against the land according to all the words of jeremiah this would include all that jeremiah had prophesied in the reign of king josiah as well as in the times above mentioned under shallum and jehoiakim the prophecies delivered in the reign of josiah according to the learned lightfoot are contained in the twelve first chapters but the thirteenth chapter and all that follow to the one and twentieth i conceive says the same judicious writer to have been delivered in the time of jehoiakim and not in the time of josiah etc see his reasons at length harmony of the old testament p            but his blood was severely avenged some years afterward in the fatal catastrophe of the tyrant  thus it appears that jehoiakim was as little mindful of the laws and religion of jehovah notwithstanding the memorial of that sacred name which pharaoh had placed upon him as his predecessor shallum for we read also in the  d book of chronicles xxxvi     that he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord  i e jehovah his god and the account of gods vengeance immediately follows the declaration of the monarchs ingratitude for  against him continues the text came up nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and bound him in fetters to carry him to babylon  in the book of daniel we find that the siege of jerusalem began in the third year of jehoiakim in the third year of the reign of jehoiakim king of judah came nebuchadnezzar king of babylon unto jerusalem and besieged it dan i      but it seems the babylonians did not immediately succeed in their enterprise for we read in the book of jeremiah an account of several transactions in the fourth year of jehoiakim  vel ut noster joseph observat says lempereur in his annotations on joseph ichiias paraphrase on daniel  annum nebucadnezaris primum statuamus incidisse in annum jehoiakimi tertium desinentem and imprimis quartum incipientem ita ut nebucadnezar venisse dicatur jehojakimi anno tertio desinente vel exacto suo autem primo currente qui respondebat partim anno illius tertio dan cap i   partim vero ejusdem quarto jer xxv   propter diversa annorum initia cum annus tertius jehoiakimi and primus nebucadnezaris idem principium non haberent etc p       and among the rest that the prophet jeremiah in that very year denounced the judgment of god upon jerusalem and judea by the hand of nebuchadnezzar which proves that the city was not as yet taken by him for in the fourth year of jehoiakim he acquainted all the inhabitants of jerusalem that  from the thirteenth year of josiah the son of amon king of judah even to this day said the prophet that is the three and twentieth year the word of the lord has come unto me and i have spoken unto you rising early and speaking but ye have not hearkened etc  therefore thus says the lord of hosts jehovah of hosts because ye have not heard my words behold i will send and take all the families of the north says the lord and nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon my servant and will bring them against this land and against the inhabitants thereof and against all these nations round about and will utterly destroy them and make them an astonishment and an hissing and perpetual the word  here construed perpetual does not necessarily bear that signification for it sometimes denotes a shorter period so that buxtorf interprets it in his lexicon as follows  seculum says he tempus homini absconditum tam infinitum and aeternum quam finitum ut genesis xvii   exodus xxi     samuel i    and xiii      samuel xii  0 etc so that the words  may rather signify some limited term of desolations  desolations of or for an age or a certain period as it is rendered in the interlineary version of the london polyglot bible  in solitudines seculi buxtorf in his lexicon remarks that raschi and aben ezra interpret the word  to signify a space of fifty years the desolations spoken of in the above text certainly were not perpetual and though the particular duration of them is not there declared yet the several histories which mention the return from captivity sufficiently prove that they were limited to some such term of years as raschi and abenezra have attributed to the word  for the servitude to babylon on which the desolations depended were expressly limited to seventy years see ver       and the total desolation did not continue so long as the captivity by about twenty years   desolations jer xxv      and as the denunciations of gods vengeance were generally accompanied with promises of future reconciliation and comfort in case of amendment so the servitude to babylon was here expressly limited to the term of serventy years  and these nations shall serve the king of babylon seventy years jer xxv       and as a further sign of gods providence and care of his people the prophet at the same time denounced a heavy retribution of vengeance against the king of babylon and that nation the instruments of gods vengeance and it shall come to pass when seventy years are accomplished that i will punish the king of babylon and that nation says the lord for their iniquity and the land of the chaldeans and will make it perpetual desolations etc for many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them also and i will recompense them according to their deedsmark this ye slaveholders and tyrants of the earth and according to the work of their own hands jer xxv        here is a just retaliation for tyranny  slavery for slavery    as also against many neighboring nations who were made to drink of the winecup of this fury  ie the sword and captivity which remarkable circumstance as here foretold should teach all nations to the end of the world the necessity which god has laid on them to take warning by the several examples of his vengeance and retribution upon the jewish nation because the prophet was directed to assure the other nations that if god spared not his own peculiar people he surely would not spare them and it shall be said god to the prophet if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drink then shall thou say unto them thus says the lord of hosts jehovah of hosts ye shall certainly drink for lo i begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name and should ye be utterly unpunished  ye shall not be unpunished for i will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth says the lord of hosts jer xxv       this declaration has been fulfilled upon all nations of the world at different times and the sword of gods wrath is still as active as ever     the   th chapter of jeremiah from the beginning to the  th verse is next in order of date because it relates to transactions of the same year  viz the fourth year of jehoiakim which must be during the siege of jerusalem by nebuchadnezzar who came up in the third year of jehoiakim the prophet was then directed to write in the roll of a book all his former prophecies from the days of josiah to that time and it came to pass in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah that this word came unto jeremiah from the lord saying take thee a roll of a book and write therein all the words that i have spoken unto thee against israel and against judah and against all the nations from the day i spoke unto thee from the days of josiah even unto this day it may be that the house of judah will hear all the evil which i purpose to do unto them that they may return every man from his evil way that i may forgive their iniquity and their sin jer xxxvi      so that repentance might still have prevented all the evil    see jer xxxvi   the book was wrote however by baruch the scribe from the mouth of jeremiah who was then in prison jer xxxvi   then jeremiah called baruch the son of neriah and baruch wrote from the mouth of jeremiah all the words of the lord which he had spoken unto him upon a roll of a book and jeremiah commanded baruch saying i am shut up i cannot go into the house of the lord therefore go thou and read in the roll which thou have written from my mouth the words of the lord in the ears of the people in the lords house upon the fasting day etc jer xxvii       this fasting day as archbishop usher remarks was that solemn annual fast ordained in the law to be kept on the  0th day of the seventh month for ever five days before the feast of tabernacles  solennis videlicet illius mensis septimi die decimo quotannis celebrati levit xvi    xxiii    number xxix   quinque diebus ante festum tabernaculorum in quo omnes mares ex omnibus civitatibus judae comparebant hierosolymis ad a m      p        and jeremiah directed baruch to read the book to the people in the temple upon a public fast day see ver       the   th chapter of jeremiah seems to be the next in order of time and contains the prophets rebuke  and seek thou great things for thyself seek them not for behold i will bring evil upon all flesh says the lord he nevertheless added a promise of life to baruch by way of comfort saying  but thy life will i give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou go jer xlv     of baruch for expressing his fears for himself when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of jeremiah in the fourth year of jehoiakim etc see ver   which plainly refers us to the time and circumstances mentioned in the   th chapter archbishop usher informs us that perhaps the  0th and   st chapters of jeremiah containing comfortable promises of future restoration are to be referred to the time of delivering the   th chapter jer xlv     quo fortasse says the archbishop referenda fuerint and capita illa duo consolatoria jer xxx and xxxi promissiones de instauranda ecclesia continentia ad a m      but afterward he seems with more certainty to date them in the year   0  see p     the   th chapter of jeremiah was fulfilled about this time that is in the fourth year of jehoiakim as the  d verse declares and the prophecies against egypt therein contained were probably declared about the same time with those against jehoiakim to show that monarch his folly in trusting to the armies of pharaoh of the same date with the   th chapter we may well suppose the   th and   th chapters to be also because the  d verse of chap xlvi does use a comprehensive expression the word of the lord against the gentiles as concluding all these sermons and prophecies against these several nations under one date and head only chap xlvii and ver    of chap xlix are of several specified dates lightfoots harmony p        but he afterward assigns them another date with more certainty and to the same year the fourth of jehoiakim that learned prelate also places the   th chapter concerning the rechabites  ingressi sunt hierosolyma jer xxxv    ubi quum de tempore praesente dicant ita cousidemus hierosolymis colligimus capitis hujus historiam de vino a rechabitis recusato eo tempore fuisse gestam quo urbs a nebuchadnesare fuit obsessa dan i   ibid ad a m      p   0    for with good reason he supposes that the circumstances therein related concerning their refusal to drink the wine which the prophet had set before them by gods command were transacted during the time of the siege by nebuchadnezzar for fear of whom the rechabites had taken shelter in the city  in the ninth month in manum nebuchadnesaris tradidit dominus jehoiakimum regem judae cum part instrumentorum domus dei dan i   mense videlicet nono sive cisleu ut colligitur ex aniversario jejunio quod in memoriam ut videtur hujus calamitatis more apud judaeos receptor zachar vii     and viii    eo mense observatum est jerem xxxvi   ad a m      p   0   of the same year two months after baruch had read the roll of prophecy in the temple which was in the seventh month jerusalem was taken josephus seems to have been desirous to conceal this fact from his gentile readers notwithstanding that the jews held a solemn fast in the ninth month in commemoration of this national calamity in the fourth year of jehoiakim for he mentions nothing of the capture of jerusalem but only informs us that in the fourth year of nebuchadnezzar and the eighth of jehoiakim in which he makes a mistake of four years the babylonian made war with great power demanding tribute of jehoiakim or threatening to fight him and that the other fearing the threats of the babylonian and purchasing peace with money paid him the tributes which he had demanded for three years   ant jud lib x c   p     but it plainly appears by the circumstances which attended that subjection of jehoiakim to the babylonians that jerusalem was then taken for the sacred writings expressly testify that nebuchadnezzar bound jehoiakim in chains to carry him to babylon though he did not then carry him away and that he carried of the vessels  i e part of the vessels of the house of the lord to babylon compare dan i   with   chronicles xxxvi     so that the temple and consequently the city was certainly at that time in the conquerors power  and as a further token of absolute conquest the king of babylon directed the master of his eunuchs to bring of the children of israel and of the kings seed and of the princes children in whom was no blemish but well favored dan i   whereby it is manifest that the eunuch was to choose he  gave order to ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs that he should make choice out of the children of the royal family and of the nobility of the land prideauxs connect part i p      out the most promising children that could be found of the seed royal and of the nobility amongst whom were daniel and his companions and send them to babylon which could not have been done if jerusalem had not then been absolutely in the hands of the babylonian conqueror   by nebuchadnezzar who bound jehoiakim in setters to carry him to babylon   chronicles xxxvi   as i before remarked but he did not then carry him away jehoiakimum catenis vincivit nebuchadnesar ut abduceret eum babyloniam   chronicles xxxvi   sed pactis postea conditionibus servitutis domi eum reliquit ubi servus illi permansit tribus annis   reg xxiv   a qua prima omnium regis and populi judaici sub nebuchadnesare facta servitute numerandi sunt anni septuaginta captivitis babylonicae a jeremia propheta praedicti jer xxv    and xxix  0 ad a m      p   0    for it appears that he was afterward continued upon the throne of david as a tributary monarch and served the king of babylon three years in his days nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came up and jehoiakim became his servant three years then he turned and rebelled against him   kings xxiv   for the babylonian monarch contented himself with taking away the most promising children of the royal family and of the nobility from whence the first commencement of the seventy years captivity is to be dated and also some of the instruments of the temple god having withheld him from taking more the reason of my speaking dubiously whether this was the fifth or sixth time that jerusalem was taken since the promise to david is because i cannot produce sufficient authorities to prove that it was taken when king manasseh was carried away captive by the king of assyria though it is very probable that the city was then also really taken because manasseh after his restoration thought it necessary to build walls and add new fortifications to different parts of the city see   chronicles xxxiii      or rather perhaps inclined him to leave the rest that the service of the temple might be still continued which it certainly was as well as the national laws and customs and also a national prince of the house of david upon the throne of david notwithstanding that the government was then held under the authority of a foreign heathen monarch which was the fifth if not the sixth time the reason of my speaking dubiously whether this was the fifth or sixth time that jerusalem was taken since the promise to david is because i cannot produce sufficient authorities to prove that it was taken when king manasseh was carried away captive by the king of assyria though it is very probable that the city was then also really taken because manasseh after his restoration thought it necessary to build walls and add new fortifications to different parts of the city see   chronicles xxxiii      that the like extraordinary circumstances were fulfilled since the promise was made to king david that his house and kingdom should be established see   samuel vii         in the fifth year of jehoiakim though the first year of his vassalage to babylon in the ninth month a fast was proclaimed in remembrance of gods judgments in the preceding year  in memoriam ut videtur urbis eodem superioris anni mense a caldaeis captae archbishop usher ad a m      dean prideaux says that the fast was held on the eighteenth day of the ninth month and is still kept by the jews he also supposed as well as archbishop usher that the city was then taken by the chaldaeans but see his words at length  the great fast of the expiation wherein baruch read the roll as is above related was annually kept by the jews on the tenth day of the month tizri which answers to our september immediately after that nebuchadnezzar invaded judaea and having laid siege to jerusalem made himself master of it in the ninth month called cisleu which answers to our november on the eighteenth day of that month for on that day is still kept by the jews an annual fast in commemoration of it even to this day and having then taken jehoiakim prisoner he put him in chains to carry him to babylon but he having humbled himself to king nebuchadnezzar and submitted to become his tributary and thereon sworn fealty to him he was again restored to his kingdom etc connect part i p         upon the jewish nation and on the fast day baruch read the words of jeremiah in the ears of all the people who were assembled on this solemn occasion in the temple and the roll which contained the prophecies being afterward read also in the presence of king jehoiakim was by his order cut to pieces and burnt after which all the former words that were in the first roll were again wrote by baruch in another roll with several tremendous additions against the nation the king of babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast jer xxxvi     as well as personally against the king himself therefore thus says the lord of jehoiakim king of judah he shall have none to sit upon the throne of david and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat and in the night to the frost jer xxxvi  0 the former part of this vengeance was fulfilled in the captivity of jehoiachin the son of jehoiakim who with all his family was soon afterward carried to babylon and a younger brother zedekiah was set up instead of the descendants of jehoiakim and the latter part of this prophecy concerning the dead body of jehoiakim is to the same effect with that prophecy repeated in the   d chapter where it is said  he shall be buried with the burial of an ass drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of jerusalem for this also it seems was literally fulfilled in due time which shall hereafter be shown    the particulars of these circumstances in the fifth of jehoiakim are related in the   th chapter of jeremiah from the  th verse to the end  after jehoiakim had served nebuchadnezzar three years then he turned and rebelled against him   kings xxiv   which must have been in the seventh year of his reign and from that time to the end of his reign the jewish nation was miserably harassed by bands of foreign troops from several different nations and the lord sent against him jehoiakim bands or troops of the chaldees and bands of the syrians and bands of the moabites and bands of the children of ammon and sent them against judah to destroy it according to the word of the lord which he spoke by his servants the prophets surely at the commandment of the lord came this upon judah to remove them out of his sight for the sins of manasseh according to all that he did and also for the innocent blood that he shed etc   kings xxiv      then subject to the dominion of nebuchadnezzar which under the providence of god were to execute the divine vengeance upon the jewish nation agreeable to the express terms of gods covenant for having neglected the divine law the people being at that time notoriously corrupt and wicked but more particularly for having neglected those parts of the law which are eternal viz the eternal laws of judgment or justice and righteousness of which the prophets were continually reminding them  we have no further information from the sacred text concerning the four remaining years of jehoiakims reign for he reigned eleven years in jerusalem   kings xxiii       only that he slept with his fathers it appears by this says the learned bishop patrick that to sleep with ones fathers signifies no more than to die as they did for jehoiachim was not buried with them nor died in his bed but being taken by the chaldaeans he died as they led him out of jerusalem and according to the prophecy of jeremiah xxii       they cast him out of the gates and he had burial of an ass that is lay upon the ground unburied abarbinel thinks continues the bishop he died in the way to babylon and his body was left in the highway without any care taken to inter it but it lay exposed to the sun by day and to the frost by night xxxvi jerem  0 see on   kings xxiv    the worthy prelate is certainly right concerning the expression to sleep with ones fathers for that is always mentioned as a distinct thing from the burial of any one as for instance  ahaz slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city even in jerusalem but they brought him not into the sepulchers of the kings of israel etc   chronicles xxviii    whereby the distinction abovementioned is rendered manifest it was the common method it seems of expressing the death not the burial of princes among the eastern nations and even in morocco where many eastern customs prevail it is necessary even to this day to use some circumlocution in expressing the death of any one as it would be esteemed a capital offense to say in the emperors presence in direct terms that any man was dead this i have been informed by a worthy friend of mine who has frequently conversed with the present emperor of morocco  but with respect to the manner of jehoiakims death i must remark that neither the opinion of the learned bishop patrick quoted above nor what he has cited from abarbinel  viz that he died in the way seem to agree with the most probable account of gods vengeance upon that wicked monarch    and that jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead   kings xxiv   but josephus in the eighth chapter of the tenth book of jewish antiquities speaking of jehoiakim he says  p     orleans edition        relates that jehoiakim received the king of the babylonians who fought against him for being terrified by the predictions of the prophet he neither shut him out nor fought against him so that the babylonian conqueror entering the city slew all the flower of the youth of jerusalem together with king jehoiakim whom he commanded to be cast unburied without the walls  and that he also appointed jehoachim his son  i e the son of jehoiakim king of the country and of the city  this is certainly the most probable account of jehoiakims death for dean prideauxs account that they took him prisoner in some sally connections part i p    besides that it is a mere supposition does not afford so literal an accomplishment of jeremiahs prophecy as the account of josephus because the words drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of jerusalem seem to imply that jehoiakims death should be in jerusalem as josephus has represented it otherwise it could not well be said that he was drawn and cast forth beyond the gates if he did not die within the gates  this second conquest of jehoiakim by nebuchadnezzar was the sixth if not the seventh time that jerusalem was taken by foreign enemies since the conditional promise was made to david concerning the establishment of his throne and the exaltation of jehoiachin by the authority of the babylonian conqueror was the seventh restoration of the house of david to the throne of david after being as often delivered into the hands of their enemies for neglecting gods laws whereby the immediate interposition of divine providence in the direction of human affairs is unquestionably demonstrated but notwithstanding these examples both of gods vengeance and of his mercy toward the house of david the young king jehoiachin  is a name compounded of two words  jehoiachin or  signifying jehovah will prepare or according to some domini praeparatio five domini firmitas see the interpretation of names in the end of the sixth volume of bishop waltons polyglot bible p  0 a transposition of these two words placing the last first forms a name of the same import though of a very different sound   ichinjehov or jexinjehov and that such a transposition of the name was frequently used is apparent because from thence is derived by abbreviation another name of this monarch by which he is sometimes mentioned viz    chronicles iii    jeconiah or iconjah having the same meaning with both the forementioned names though the learned pasor in his greek lexicon of the new testament renders it praeparatus a domino which is more properly the meaning of coniah  or conjehov the name by which the prophet jeremiah has distinguished the same monarch in his   d and   th chapters as the characteristical letter of the future tense is omitted in the lastmentioned name   alias jeconiah or coniah very soon afterward fell into all the wickedness of his fathers and consequently was rejected by the god of israel for the monarch was speedily informed by the prophet jeremiah that god had determined to deliver him up into the hands of his enemies and into the hands of bebuchadnezzar whose face he feared as i live faith the lord though coniah the son of jehoiakim king of judah were the signet upon my right hand yet would i pluck thee thence and i will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life and into the hand of them whose face thou fear even into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and into the hand of the chaldeans etc jer xxii        this chapter contains also several other prophecies against the sons and successors of king josiah in the exact order of their respective reigns just as the prophet repeated them after they were fulfilled in his remonstrance to king zedekiah and his wicked court though undoubtedly the prophet had before declared them in due time whilst each of the said monarchs remained upon the throne of david but no other account remains of these particular prophecies except in this   d chapter which shall hereafter be proved i hope to be only an occasional repetition of them in the presence of zedekiah    though it seems he feared not god for the text informs us that he did evil in the sight of the lord according to all that his father had done   kings xxiv   and then immediately follows the account of gods vengeance against him  at that time says the text the servants of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came up against jerusalem and the city was besieged the siege here mentioned is erroneously cited by dean prideaux in his connections part i p    as a transaction during the life of jehoiakim whereas nothing can be more plain than the narrative of the sacred text wherein after the historian has mentioned the commencement of jehoiachins alias coniahs reign and his evil conduct he proceeds next in course to this account of the divine vengeance in the  0th verse which dr prideaux has applied to the reign of jehoiakim and the sacred historian still continuing the account of that siege in the following verses informs us in the   th verse that jehoiachin expressly by name king of judah went out to the king of babylon he and his mother etc so that there is not the least ground for placing the siege in the reign of jehoiakim      kings xxiv  0  this vengeance must have followed very close upon the footsteps of this kings iniquity for it seems he reigned in jerusalem only three months  and ten days compare   kings xxiv   with   chronicles xxxvi    and when the year was expired king nebuchadnezzar sent and brought him to babylon   chronicles xxxvi  0 that is nebuchadnezzar first of all sent his servants viz his army against jerusalem who besieged the city as i have already related from the second book of kings dean prideaux hoped to have solved the difficulty occasioned by his own error mentioned in the preceding note by asserting that the siege in the reign of jehoiachin was only a continuation of the former siege in the reign of jehoiakim for he says  after jehoiakims death the servants of nebuchadnezzar that is says he his lieutenants and governors of the provinces that were under his subjection in those parts still continued says he to block up jerusalem etc connect part i p    and he once more cites for his authority the very same text which he had before applied to the reign of jehoiakim and though he adds also the verse which follows it as a further authority  viz   kings xxiv  0    yet neither of these verses mention a word about the supposed continuance of the siege from the reign of jehoiakim to the end of jehoiachins reign neither can any such continuance be reasonably implied therein to authorize such an assertion in short the whole error seems to have been occasioned by his adhering to his own supposition beforementioned viz that jehoiakim was  taken prisoner in some sally it may be supposed says he  which he made upon them etc connect part i p    for which he has not the least authority the supposition being on the contrary directly opposite to the testimony of josephus before recited and contrary also to the necessary accomplishment of jeremiahs prophecy against jehoiakim which i hope has already been sufficiently demonstrated the dean nevertheless persists in the same hypothesis also in page    of the first part    but he did not bring jehoiachin to babylon until he himself went also against the city see   kings xxiv    and then the text informs us jehoiachin the king of judah went out to the king of babylon he and his mother and his servants and his princes and his officers and the king of babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign that is says bishop patrick in the eighth year of nebuchadnezzars reign for he began to reign in the fourth year of jehoiakim he should rather have said in the latter end of the third year of jehoiakim though the first year of nebuchadnezzar includes also the greatest part of the fourth year of jehoiakim who reigned seven more after that which was or until the eighth year of nebuchadnezzar    and he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the lord and the treasures of the kings house and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which solomon king of israel had made in the temple of the lord as the lord had said and he carried away all jerasalem and all the princes and all the mighty men of valor even ten thousand captives and all the craftsmen and smiths none remained save the poorest sort of the people of the land etc   kings xxiv        etc all these circumstances sufficiently prove that nebuchadnezzar was now a third time master of jerusalem this being the seventh if not the eighth time that the city of jerusalem fell into the hands of foreign enemies since the conditional promise was made to king david of an established throne but as jehoiachin forsook the ways of god he was of course forsaken of god in his temporal government and was given up to his enemies with his mother his wives his officers and the mighty of the land who were all carried away together into captivity from jerusalem to babylon   kings xxiv    etc  and thereby afforded to all future administrations of national government an awful example of the divine vengeance against kings and rulers that neglect the eternal laws of god but though nebuchadnezzar thought it necessary to depose jehoiachin as well as his father jehoiakim before him yet he still persisted in maintaining  the house of david ezekiel xvii     upon the throne of david and accordingly made mattaniah his fathers brother king in his stead and changed his name to zedekiah   kings xxiv     this monarch was the third of king josiahs sons by hamutal the daughter of jeremiah of libnah   kings xxiv    she was also the mother of jehoahaz or shallum as he is called in   chronicles iii    and in jer xxii    the immediate successor of josiah who was deposed and carried away by pharaohnechoh ibid xxiii      that succeeded him upon the throne of david notwithstanding that the nation had been four times conquered by foreign enemies since josiahs death but it is still more remarkable that both these foreign conquerors pharaohneco and nebuchadnezzar should not only persist in setting up the princes of the house of david upon the throne of david but should also remind them of their indispensible obligation to maintain the laws and religion of the god of israel by putting upon them respectively a memorial of the sacred name of jehovah for i have already shown that pharaohneco gave the name of jehoiakim signifying jehovah will establish when he set up a monarch over the peculiar people of jehovah and now again nebuchadnezzar not only obliged his new vassal to  swear by god compare   chronicles xxxvi     viz  nebuchadnezzar who had made him swear by god with ezekiel xvii        viz  and made a covenant with him and has taken an oath of him   that he would observe the covenant which was then made between them but he also put upon him a signal memorial of the name and peculiar principle of the only true god jehovah by giving him the surname of zedekiah   kings xxiv     tsadokjehov signifying the righteousness of jehovah or jehovah is righteous whereby it is manifest as i have before remarked that the laws and religion of jehovah were tolerated or continued among the jews even by the authority and avowed consent of the heathen conqueror himself which surely denotes that he was guided in this matter by a very particular providence for at the same time that he afforded the jews an opportunity of retrieving their past conduct by observing more strictly the laws of god and the forms of their own national religion he set before them in the surname of their new monarch the sum essence and ultimate purpose of all true religion the righteousness of jehovah this was a name therefore of such actual importance to the jewish state though perhaps a common name even before that time among the jews that it could not have occurred by the mere light of nature to the babylonian stranger on the solemn occasion of confirming and establishing a king of judah to which it was most particularly adapted for it was really the name as shall be more particularly shown hereafter of that future king of the jews in whom alone the throne of david behold the days come says the lord that i will raise unto david a righteous brauch and a king shall reign and prosper and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth in his days judah shall be saved and israel shall dwell safely and this is his name whereby he shall be called the lord our righteousness jer xxiii     i e  jehovahtsadecns which is the same name only transposed with zedekiah  or tsadekjehov except that the former has the small addition of the possessive particle  signifying our viz jehovah our righteousness instead of the righteousness of jehovah   could be truly and effectually  established for ever this surely was far above the knowledge and comprehension of a heathen stranger unacquainted with the revealed laws of god  it was also the name which of all others could best point out to the jews the only certain method of establishing the throne of david then newly restored and indeed of establishing every other throne to the end of the world i mean a strict conformity to the eternal law of righteousness  the righteousness of jehovah there was no other method of averting the dreadful retribution at that time fully due to the jewish nation  that impending vengeance and desolation of which the conqueror and present restorer of the kingdom was himself the appointed executioner in case of disobedience see how the same means of averting gods vengeance has been since set before us even by the savior of the world himself as the first principle of sound policy  seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things temporal necessaries shall be added unto you mat vi    but zedekiah paid so little regard to the righteousness of jehovah and proved so notoriously unworthy to bear that glorious name that the prophet jeremiah was very soon afterward commanded to denounce gods vengeance against him even in the beginning as it seems of his reign that is as the text informs us after that nebuchadrezzar king of babylon had carried away captive jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah and the princes of judah etc the revelation was made under the type of a basket of evil figs see the   th chapter but as the judgments therein contained are denounced not only against the king but also against his princes and the residue of jerusalem chap xxiv   we may presume that this   th chapter was not revealed till zedekiah had so far settled himself in the kingdom as to have appointed princes and as the evil figs which cannot be eaten they are so evil surely thus says the lord so will i give zedekiah the king of judah and his princes and the residue of jerusalem that remain in this land and them that dwell in the land of egypt for many of the jews had fled to egypt for an assylum and i will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for their hurt to be a reproach and a proverb a taunt and a curse in all places whither i shall drive them etc chap xxiv       and other officers under him because all the princes and all persons of any distinction and he nebuchadnezzar carried away all jerusalem and all the princes and all the mighty men of valor even ten thousand captives and all the craftsmen and smiths none remained save the poorest sort of the people of the land   king xxiv      in the former reign were carried into captivity with their king jehoiachin   kings xxiv    and therefore though the severe sentence in the   th chapter was denounced in the beginning of zedekiahs reign yet undoubtedly he had already given sufficient proofs that his trust was in man and not in god so that his condemnation was just about this time likewise the prophecies contained in the   th chapter of jeremiah were sent in a letter from the prophet to the captives at babylon by the hands of the ambassadors whom zedekiah sent to the king of babylon in the   th verse of this chapter the prophet repeats a part of the   th chapter relating to the type of evil figs which as well as the preamble of each proves that these two chapters were delivered about the same time the two next chapters  viz xxx and xxxi seem also to follow very properly i have before quoted the opinion of archbishop usher where he supposes these two chapters might perhaps be referred to the date of the   th chapter but he afterward with more certainty refers them to the time of the   th chapter ad a m   0  which is agreeable also to the opinion of dr lightfoot harmony of the old test p         in the beginning in principio regni sedekiae prophetia de elamitis tum subigendis tum restaurandis a jeremia prolata est jer xlix       etc ad a m   0  p       also of zedekiahs reign the prophet jeremiah denounced gods vengeance against elam or persia but promised at the same time a future restoration see the   th chapter of jeremiah from the   th verse the word of the lord that came to jeremiah the prophet against elam in the beginning of the reign of zedekiah king of judah saying thus says the lord of hosts jehovah of armiss behold i will break the bow of elam etc the persians were always famous archers as well as excellent horsemen    whether the judgments against ammon edom damascus etc contained in the former part of this chapter were delivered also at the same time does not appear it is rather more probable that they were delivered about the same time with the   th and   th chapters viz in the fourth year of jehoiakim for which opinion i have already quoted the authority of the learned lightfoot some of these nations were doomed to temporal vengeance in the beginning of jehoiakims reign the prophecy of this vengeance contained in the   th chapter of jeremiah was to be afterward communicated to them by their own ambassadors in the reign of zedekiah which could not be done till the latter end at least of his fourth year though the learned archbishop of armagh places that revelation in the beginning of zedekiahs reign see ad a m   0  p     regum edomaeorum moabitarum ammonitarum tyri and sidonis legatis hierosolyma ad visitandum novum regem sedekiam venientibus deus jeremiam vincula and lora tradere jubet ad dominos fuos perferenda etc  but the hebrew text declares that god gave this charge to jeremiah in the beginning of jehoiakims reign which i hope i have already proved where i speak of that reign see also dr lightfoot on the   th chapter of jeremiah in his harmony of the old testament p         the  0th and   st chapters of jeremiah seem to come next in order of time they contain dreadful denunciations of gods vengeance and retribution against babylon the mighty instrument of gods vengeance of which i shall have occasion to say more hereafter in the   st chapter ver  0 we read that jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon babylon even all these words that are written against babylon which of course must include both chapters and we are enabled to ascertain the date of them by the preceding verse which together with the following verses informs us that the prince seraiah was directed to read the said prophecies at babylon when he went there with zedekiah in the fourth year of his reign and was afterward to cast the book into the midst of the river euphrates jer li         there is no particular mention in scripture of any transactions of zedekiah between the fourth and ninth years of his reign only that he rebelled against the king of babylon in sending ambassadors into egypt that they might give him horses and much people so that he seems to have entertained a foolish and wicked desire to render himself absolute and independent by means of a standing army of foreign mercenaries for he not only endeavored to procure horses from egypt but also much people shall he prosper shall he escape that does such things ezekiel xvii       ezekiel xvii    and as he vainly put his whole trust in a military force the solemn oath which he had so lately taken was made to yield to his political views though he had called god to witness so that the perjured monarchs will and pleasure was preferred to that righteousness in the execution of covenants and laws which alone can establish the thrones of kings take away the wicked from before the king and his throne shall be established in righteousness prove xxv    for the throne is established by righteousness chap xvi     in righteousness shall thou be established isaiah live     and in mercy shall the throne be established and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of david judging and seeking judgment or justice  and hasting righteousness isaiah xvi   the constant lesson of the prophet jeremiah to zedekiah and the house of david was  execute ye judgment and righteousness and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor  do no wrong do no violence to the stranger etc    and of which his new name zedekiah or righteousness of jehovah was certainly intended to remind him this wicked policy was censured in the severest terms by the prophet ezekiel  shall he prosper said the prophet shall he escape that does such things or shall he break the covenant and be delivered as i live says the lord god surely in the place where the king dwells that made him king whose oath he despised and whose covenant he brake even with him in the midst of babylon he shall die neither shall pharaoh for pharaoh was also one of those mistaken monarchs who placed his whole trust in military power and was censured also by the same prophet for his folly and presumption thus says the lord god behold i am against thee pharaoh king of egypt the great dragon that lies in the midst of his rivers which has said my river is mine own and i have made it for myself but i will put my hooks in thy jaws etc ezekiel xxix        with his mighty army and great company make for him in the war by casting up mounts and building forts to cut off many persons seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant when lo he had given his hand and has done all these things he shall not escape therefore thus says the lord god as i live surely mine oath that he has despised and my covenant that he has broken even it i will recompense upon his own head and i will spread my net upon him and he shall be taken in my snare and i will bring him to babylon and will plead with him there for his trespass that he has trespassed against me and all his fugitives with all his bands  viz his regiments or military forces in which he trusted shall fall by the sword and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds and ye shall know that i the lord have spoken it ezekiel xvii        thus zedekiahs fate was appointed to be one of the many proofs which god vouchsafed to the jews to demonstrate the truth of his revelation by the prophets  in the ninth year of zedekiah the impending vengeance became visible by the near approach of the babylonian army as i have before remarked in page    for then began to be fulfilled what had been foretold not only in the fourth year of jehoiakim but probably also in the reign of josiah compare jer i    with xxv   in the former god declares  i will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north etc and in the latter behold i will send and take all the families of the north says the lord thereby marking his absolute direction of them and nebuchadrezzar the king of babylon my servant and will bring them against this land etc  and accordingly after nebuchadnezzar had strengthened his empire by reducing to his obedience all the kingdoms of the assyrian as well as the syrian dominion which latter lay to the north of judaea and extended quite up to armenia the armenians themselves being no other than syrians for aram is the proper name in scripture for syria he compelled the conquered nations to assist him in reducing others to a like servile subjection under his own arbitrary will without perceiving that he and they collectively were but a mere instrument of vengeance and thus was nebuchadnezzar raised up by god to be a scourge compare this with what i have already remarked concerning that monarch in pages          and    to all the nations about him for the punishment of their sins nebuchadnezzar had indeed other things in his head that which he designed was the gratifying his own ambition and enlarging his dominions but these were not the ends which god had to serve by him god made use of him as his instrument as his servant for so he calls him for the rendering to the nations that just recompense of vengeance which their sins called for i mention thse things the rather because they are instances of gods dealing with heathen nations who were under no particular covenant with god archbishop sharps sermons vol i sermon   entitled virtue and religion the only means to make a nation prosperous p  0   th edition   in the hands of the lord of hosts or god of armies for we read in the   th chapter of jeremiah that nebuchadnezzar literally fulfilled the former prophecies by coming to fight against jerusalem with all his army and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion etc i have already related the message which zedekiah sent to the prophet jeremiah on this occasion with the prophets answer which is the subject of the   st chapter and that the prophet was directed also to repeat the subject of that answer in the presence of zedekiah and his whole court which leads me once more to the consideration of the   d chapter the difficulty of which had obliged me to go back and investigate the histories of the preceding princes of judah and of the times when the several prophecies against them by jeremiah were revealed and though this necessary digression has i fear been extended to a much greater length than is consistent with due order and method yet i trust my candid readers will excuse this defect in mere matter of form if they should find any thing in my digression that may tend to illustrate and render more familiar to the generality of readers that excellent book the collection of jeremiahs prophecies in which all mankind are materially concerned and interested for the certainty of gods vengeance upon wicked nations is unquestionably demonstrated in the prophecies of jeremiah so that the tenor of that whole book indeed relates in some degree to my present subject though i had at first intended to confine myself in this tract to the examination only of the   st   d and   th chapters as being more particularly levelled against oppressors tyrants and slaveholders  commentators have generally conceived that the divine message recorded in the   d chapter from the beginning to the   th verse at least was not delivered to zedekiah but to jehoiakim because a prophecy against the latter is recorded in the   th verse viz therefore said the prophet referring back to the offenses beforementioned thus says the lord concerning jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah they shall not lament for him saying ah my brother etc he shall be buried with the burial of an ass etc  but if we carefully examine the whole chapter with reference to the chapter which precedes as well as that which follows it will be found much more intelligible coherent and striking when the whole is considered as one continued address to zedekiah reminding him of the judgments denounced and then indeed fulfilled against his immediate predecessors exactly according to the order of their reigns and expressly for the same offenses  viz oppression and the neglect of justice and right for which he himself by name is condemned in the   st chapter the only difficulty which attends this construction is occasioned by the english translators having used the present tense in the   th   th and   th verses where the praeter tense would certainly have been much more proper viz thus says the lord instead of thus said the lord to or concerning jehoiakim etc which latter is the literal construction of the original and is always so expressed in the interlineary latin version of the london polyglot viz sic dixit dominus for though in many other places it is indifferent to the sense whether the present or praeter tense is used yet in these abovementioned it makes a very material difference because the prophet is only reminding zedekiah of the prophecies which he had before denounced or at least to the same effect against his disobedient predecessors as that for instance against jehoiakim was first delivered by baruch the scribe though not exactly in the same words yet surely to the same purport in the presence of jehoiakim himself after he had burnt the roll of jeremiahs prophecies viz his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat and in the night to the frost jer xxxvi  0 which is the same thing in effect as to be buried with the burial of an ass drawn and cast forth jehoiakimus a chaldaeis captus abjectus fuit insepultus nempe sepultura asini sepultus tractus and projectus ultra portas hierosolymorum juxta prophetiam jerem xxii       and xxxvi  0 licet ad communem naturae legem respectu habito dormivisse dicatur ille cum patribus suis   reg xxiv   ad a m   0  though the learned archbishop in the above sentence supposes indeed that the quotation he there makes from the   d chapter is really a prophecy and not merely as i suppose the repetition of a prophecy yet it is plain that he esteemed it of the same import with the original prophecy in the   th chapter by his quoting them together in order to explain the one by the other    etc according to the repetition of the prophecy before zedekiah as related in chap xxii        the prophet in the beginning of the chapter is directed to go down to the house of the king of judah and speak there this word and say hear the word of the lord o king of judah that sit upon the throne of david etc now the question is who was the prince who then sat upon the throne of david to whom the divine message was directed whether shallum jehoiakim jehoiachin or zedekiah it could not be shallum though he is the first mentioned therein because the text describes him expressly as one which went sorth out of this place being already carried into captivity by pharaohnecho and the burden of the prophecy against him was that  he shall return no more etc see the endings of all the three verses wherein he is mentioned viz  0    and    which all end with that burden again it is not likely that jehoiakim who is mentioned next in order was then the reigning prince because his son and successor jehoiachin alias coniah or jeconiah is mentioned in the continuance of the fame declaration in a much more conspicuous light than jehoiakim himself being addressed in the second person as if present at the time of the denunciation viz i will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life etc and i will cast thee out etc  and though jehoiachin probably was the reigning prince upon the throne when this severe prophecy against him was first of all denounced and also though he is expressly spoken of in the   th verse as present viz this man coniah yet he was not the prince that sat upon the throne of david when jeremiah repeated as i conceive these several prophecies mentioned in the   d chapter because the prophet after a most solemn and alarming exclamation  o earth earth earth hear the word of the lord concludes his message with a dreadful sentence against a prince whom he also calls this man as if present  viz write ye this man childless which by no means agrees with the case either of jehoiakim or coniah the former certainly was not childless for besides his son jehoiachin or coniah it is not improbable but that daniel and his fellows or at least some of them were also the children of jehoiakim for they were of the kings seed and of the princes dan i   that were carried to babylon in the third year or rather the fourth year of jehoiakim when that monarch was twentyeight or twentynine years of age and it is as certain that coniah or jehoiachin was not childless because express mention is made of his seed or children in the   th verse of this   d chapter viz that he and his seed are cast into a land that they know not and no less than eight sons of his are expressly mentioned in   chronicles iii        the sons of jeconiah the same with coniah assir salathiel his son malchiram also and pedaiah and shenazar jecamiah hoshama and nedabiah   chronicles iii          neither did coniah lose his children during the captivity as the learned mr goadby in hopes of removing the difficulty has ventured to assert write ye this man childless that he had children says mr goadby appears from the   th verse and therefore this is a prophecy that he should lose them during his captivity   for he was so far from losing his children during his captivity that it is probable they were most of them born during the captivity for he was but eighteen years of age when he began to reign and he reigned in jerusalem only three months   kings xxiv   and ten days   chronicles xxxvi   so that it is not easy to conceive that he could have so many as eight children before he was carried to babylon but the matter is put out of dispute by the apostle matthew who informs us expressly that after they were brought to babylon jechonias begat salathiel and salathiel begat zorobabel etc mat i    from whence a regular succession is continued for more than five hundred years down to joseph the hushand of the blessed virgin the prophecy therefore of jeremiah write ye this man childless could not relate to coniah nor to any other prince of the house of david cotemporary with jeremiah except zedekiah alone and in him it was indeed literally fulfilled for the king of babylon slew the sons of zedekiah in riblah before his eyes jer xxxix   which clearly answers to the prophecy write ye this man childless i have taken the more pains to explain this necessary application of the prophecy because amongst the commentators that have erroneously applied it to coniah i have to oppose the weighty authority of the very learned and worthy archbishop of armagh for whose testimony in general i have the highest esteem though here i am obliged to dissent from him on account of the superior authority of the text he says  contra hunc speaking of jehoiachin severissimum dei judicium denunciatum extat in fine capitis xxii jeremiae sententia hac quasi in acta referenda domum conclusum scribite virum hunc liberis carentem virum non prosperaturum in diebus suis nam non prosperabitur de semine ejus quisquam sessurus in solio davidis et dominaturus amplius in juda jer xxii  0 vide ad a m   0  p     this by no means agrees with the case of jehoiachin but is perfectly answerable to that of zedeliah who was not only rendered childless by the sword but was also a man that did not prosper in his days for he afterward lingered out a miserable life blind and in chains at babylon moreover says the text be the king of babylon put out zedekiahs eyes and bound him with chains to carry him to babylon jer xxxix      whereas jehoiachin who was carried into captivity before him did after that time really prosper in his days for though he had done evil in the sight of the lord for which he was removed as i have before remarked yet the great searcher of hearts perceived something in him worthy of the divine mercy as also in several others that were carried into captivity at the same time which was declared very soon after the commencement of their punishment and a mitigation was then promised by the prophet jeremiah under the type of a basket of good figs see the   th chapter whereas zedekiah and those who remained with him were likened to a basket of evil figs to which a heavy curse was annexed perfectly agreeable to the severe sentence in chap xxii  0 which i have applied to zedekiah and as perfectly unapplicable to jehoiachin the latter and those that were carried away with him had an absolute promise of grace peace and prosperity thus says the lord the god of israel like these good figs so will i acknowledge them that are carrted away captive of judah  viz jeconiah and the princes of judah with the carpenters and smiths that were carried with them see the first verse whom i have sent out of this place into the land of the chaldaeans for their good for i will set mine eyes upon them for good and i will bring them again to this land and i will build them and not pull them down and i will plant them and not pluck them up and i will give them an heart to know me that i am the lord and they shall be my people and i will be their god for they shall return unto me with their whole heart jer xxiv       that like the good figs god would acknowledge them and set his eyes upon them for good and would bring them again to their own land that is some of them and their descendants that he would build them and not pull them down etc that he would give them an heart to know him etc upon the whole that they were in the land of the chaldaeans for their good and accordingly the scriptures hear a remarkable testimony concerning the good which god reserved for jehoiachin in the land of the chaldaeans so that he must necessarily be said to have prospered in his days for we read expressly that evilmerodach king of babylon in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of jehoiachin king of judah and brought him out of prison and spoke kindly unto him and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in babylon so that of him who was thus set up as in the highest place of favor upon a throne in the presence of the most powerful king at that time upon earth it could not he said that he did not prosper in his days especially as this extraordinary favor and prosperity lasted all his days for we read in the text that he did continually eat bread before him the babylonian monarch all the days of his life and for his diet there was a continual diet given him of the king of babylon every day a portion until the day of his death all the days of his life jer lii         surely therefore it would be as improper to say of this man jehoiachin who had so great a share of prosperity that he did not prosper in his days as to  write him childless who had so many children and so long and complete a succession of descendants some of whom as salathiel and zorobabel were rulers in judah though they did not sit upon the throne of david the prophecy therefore of these unhappy circumstances the deprivation of children and want of prosperity in the   d chapter could not by any means relate to jehoiachin or his descendants and there was no other monarch after him upon the throne of david to whom it could be applied except zedekiah alone    now as it is manifest that the last verse of the   d chapter of jeremiah was addressed to zedekiah it is equally manifest that the beginning of it was also to him i have had the satisfaction to find since i wrote the above that the learned grotius was also of the same opinion and that he also comfirms what i have suggested above concerning the repetition of former prophecies in the presence of king zedekiah for in his commentary on the beginning of the   d chapter  haec dicit dominus  he thus expresses himself   haec dixit says he preferring the praeter to the present tense jeremias enim sedeciae loquens simul repetit quae regibus antecedetibus fratriscilicet ipsius sedecuaem fratrisque filio praedixerat ne quid haberent quod de tam gravi dei ultione conquererentur annotata ad vet test tom ii p  0  see also crituci sacri tom iv p      i find also that the learned and reverend authors of the commentary commonly called assemblys annotation have objected to this interpretation of grotius for i suppose by their recital of his hypothesis that they mean him though they have not mentioned his name but yet they have not advanced any sufficient arguments to confute his doctrine neither have they removed the obvious difficulties which if i may judge of grotius by myself occasioned that hypothesis and therefore i conclude that these difficulties cannot in any other way be so easily explained    for the first part of the divine message in the   d chapter is nearly a repetition of the answer which the prophet had before returned by pashur and zephaniah the messengers sent to him by king zedekiah as mentioned in the preceding chapter which will clearly appear by the following collation  part of the answer of the prophet jeremiah sent to king zedekiah by passur and zephaniah as recorded in the   st chapter and touching the house of the king of judah say hear ye the word of the lord o house of david the address to the whole gourt inserted in the remonstrance is here omitted because this was a message only to the house of david thus says the lord execute judgment in the morning and deliver him that is spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor this general term the hand of the oppressor necessarily includes violence to the stranger the fatherless etc lest my fury go out like fire and burn that none can quench it because of the evil of your doings jer xxi        the first part of the prophet jeremiahs personal address to king zedekiah recorded in the   d chapter hear the word of the lord o king of judah that sit upon the throne of david thou and thy servants and thy people that enter in by these gates thus says the lord execute ye judgment and righteousness and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor and do no wrong do no violence to the stranger the fatherless and the widow etc  but if ye will not hear these words i swear by myself says the lord jehovah that this house the palace shall become a desolation etc jer xxii          the prophet afterward proceeds in the  th  th and  th verses of his remonstrance to the king and court to declare the certainty of desolation and vengeance if they would not hear his words and in the  th and  th verses he assigns a general reason and many nations shall pass by this city and they shall say every man to his neighbor wherefore has the lord done thus unto this great city then they shall answer because they have forsaken the covenant of the lord their god and worshipped other gods and served them jer xxii     now probably the british slavedealer and british american slaveholder will be apt to argue from thence that the several examples of gods vengeance upon the jews which i have cited in this tract have no relation to the subject of difference between them and me we have not worshipped other gods and served them perhaps they will say so that the account of gods vengeance against jerusalem which granville sharp has cited as a warning against slavedealing and slaveholding is not at all applicable to us  but let me as a friend and countryman warn all such persons that they have really worshipped other gods and served them and have broken the christian covenant in as notorious and impious a manner as ever the ancient jews did the covenant of sinai respecting the breach of covenant i have wrote at large in another tract now in the press and shall therefore only offer at present a few hints respecting the horrid crime of serving other gods  christ himself has taught us that no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other and then he immediately adds ye cannot serve god and mammon mat vi    and luke xvi    here the service of mammon is placed in as direct opposition to the service of god as ever was the service of baal moloch or chemosh though the first means not any particular idol but only the baneful influence of riches or the undue prevalence of private interest over all sense of religion justice and virtue in like manner covetousness which includes all that i have said of mammon is frequently mentioned in scripture as downright idolatry for this ye know said the apostle paul to the ephesians chap v   that no whoremonger nor unclean person nor covetous man who is an idolater has any inheritance in the kingdom of christ and of god and in the epistle to the colossians the same apostle warns us against some of the common vices which draw down the wrath of god viz fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil concupiscence and covetousness which is idolatry col iii    neither is covetousness the only vice that is deemed idolatry  all the other lusts and carnal indulgences are equally ranked with idolatry so that those inconsiderate persons who yield to any of them may as aptly be said to serve other gods as those backsliding professors of christianity at philippi whom the apostle paul expressly charged with this kind of idolatry viz whose god is their belly  for many walk says he of whom i have told you often and now tell you even weeping that they are the enemies of the cross of christ whose end is destruction whose god is their belly and whose glory is in their shame who mind earthly things philip iii       and the service of the belly even the schismatical teachers of novel doctrines are ranked with those idolaters who serve their own belly and serve not god  for they that are such serve not our lord jesus christ but their own belly and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple romans xvi       is placed in as direct opposition to the service of christ as the service of the pantheon or all the heathen deities could be for it is as effectually the service of devils as the latter   whosoever commiteth sin is the servant of sin john viii    and if the servant of sin then also the servant of the devil for   he that commits sin said the same apostle is of the devil   john iii   and though men are not so lost to common sense in these more enlightened days of christianity as personally to worship at the shrines of demons or devils yet they serve the devil as effectually as ever to the destruction of their own souls by yielding to his temptations whether through mammon or carnal lust  for  know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of god be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of god i cor vi   and  0  thus it is clearly demonstrable i trust that mankind may be guilty of idolatry and of serving devils without paying any personal adoration to their idols and on this i found my warning not only to slavedealers and slaveholders but also to my countrymen in general the dangerous prevalency of the devils empire in these kingdoms through the service of mammon and of carnal lust may be known by the following general marks  st by the shameful spirit of timeserving venality and private interest which is every where predominant to the destruction of true loyalty and national independence  dly by the increased number of notorious gaming houses which are frequented by the nobility and gentry of this kingdom for days and nights together  dly by the multitudes of poor female prostitutes which swarm in the public streets and also by the frequency of masquerades and midnight balls which apparently afford to the idle and vicious part of mankind the most dangerous opportunities of triumphing over unwary virtue and of spreading the baneful taint of prostitution amongst females of superior rank whereby many persons of rank and figure in the gay world are become almost as notoriously dedicated as it were to venus or the assyrian goddess mylitta see herodotus lib i p    as ever the heathens were of old but the greatest mark of national infamy and of satans empire amongst us and that indeed which at present i am engaged more particularly to oppose is the shameful public encouragement given to the african slave trade wherein the service of mammon and of the devil is rendered apparent by the horrible destruction of the human species which it annually occasions a particular state of that trade lies now before me whereby it appears that the number of negro slaves bartered for in one year viz      on the coast of africa from cape blanco to rio congo amounted to  0  00 souls whereof more than half viz    00 were shipped on the account of british merchants and   00 on the account of british americans  by another state of this trade in      it appears that ships were sent from liverpool for     0 bristol for    0 london for      lancaster for   0 in all for       souls exclusive of those imported by british american and west indian traders in some former years the subjects of great britain seem to have had still a much greater proportion of this cursed trade to answer for my worthy friend mr anthony benezet in his historical account of guinea c xiii p   0 cites andersons history of trade and commerce to the following effect viz that england supplies her american colonies with negro slaves amounting in number to above one hundred thousand every year    which in that year were probably very considerable because in the following year      several of the north american provinces began to be alarmed for the dangerous consequences of tolerating such an unchristian like practice which sentiment was fully expressed in some of their public assemblies especially in those of virginia pennsylvania and the jersies which shall be shown hereafter and i hope they have put a stop to this detestable practice time enough to avert gods vengeance from those regions though they must take notice that their reformation is but half complete and consequently that they are still in danger whilst they permit individuals to hold in perpetual bondage see the vengeance of god denounced by the prophets isaiah and jeremiah against the mighty babylonian empire and it is monarch which opened not the house of his prisoners isa xiv    but oppressed the captives they had taken and held them fast they refused to let them go jer l      the poor african captives already imported now if we consider what multitudes of men must have been killed merely in the attempt to take so many wretched captives for sale and again what multitudes out of so large a number would die as usual in their passage to the west indies and america either of grief and despair or by being inhumanly stifled in the holds of ships besides the large proportion nearly one half that would die of the seasoning as it is called after their arrival in the plantations and lastly that all the remainder of this vast multitude of  0  00 miserable human beings will probably be worn out by hard service and oppression in the space of about    years or less according to the average rate of some calculations that have been published these considerations i say must needs inspire us with indignation and horror even though the evil at present is at a considerable distance from us see the appendix to my representation of the injustice and dangerous tendency of tolerating slavery etc  add to this destruction the number of brave seamen that are annually cut off either by the rising of the negroes  a french slaving ship having been surprised by an insurrection of the negroes who murdered most part of the crew the mate finding no possibility to escape the like fate had set fire to the powderroom and blew up the vessel with upwards of two hundred slaves on board gazetteer april         i have heard of many instances of the like disasters happening to crews of english slaving ships and even one of my own relations perished in the same unlawful trade with the whole ships crew   in the slave ships or by pestilential distempers caught from the poor negroes confined in the holds of the said ships add also the number of free negroes occasionally blown up  the polly captain walsh a ship belonging to mr adams struck on the bar of bonny this last year the book was printed in      and was

african merchant appendix f p    a deplorable hardness of heart seems to have possessed this african merchant for it appears by his manner of relating the above story that he approved of captain

slavecoasts in the year      mr grosile burned the town of annamaboe and killed three or four of the townspeople ibid p  00    and likewise the number of poor wretches annually sent out by the african company as soldiers who miserably perish in their settlements  the poor wretches sent out by the committee have nothing on earth to support or comfort them in sickness or health but a rasher of salt beef stinking new england rum and portuguese tobacco by which means forty soldiers have perished at cape coast out of fortyeight from march the  st to the   th of may all of whom came out in the jamaica storeship about the middle of last february african merchant appendix p       and to complete this list of diabolical admitting the african trade to be ever so diabolical says a writer under the signature of a planter quoted by the said african merchant appendix c p    or the means by which the negros body was first obtained ever so unfair no blame can deservedly rest on the planter who is ignorant of the means and innocent says he of the guilt  but now even supposing the body of the negro to have been obtained in whatever manner the planter may esteem the most fair which the planter will probably allege to be that the negro was a convicted criminal in his native country yet this criminal never offended the planter nor the laws of the planters nation nor the king lords and commons who have shared as he says in the profits of the slave trade so that neither the planter nor any of his abettors can have any just right to continue the punishment of an offense committed in another country especially as neither he nor they can possibly know whether or not the negro was really guilty and therefore admitting the african trade to be ever so diabolical or the means by which the negros body was first obtained ever so unfair the planter though he only buys and retains the slave must share the heavy load of guilt with the diabolical kidnnapper because he has encouraged the oppression by his purchase and continues it by his slaveholding   wickedness add the horrid carnage and bloodshed that has frequently been occasioned by the insurrections of slaves and the more horrible punishments that have been inflicted on the poor wretched slaves to deter them from such attempt from the wokingham journal of the   th of april       the following is an extract of a letter of the  0th of november from one of the hon council board of tobago a conspiracy of  0 coromantees has kept us in continual alarm these    days past thank god it is now quite over as most of them are either killed hanged burnt or taken i had four out who lay down near rockleybay cut one anothers throats and died mutually in each others arms  the following paragraph was also taken from one of the public newspapers about the same time  extract of a letter from jamaica jan     the only thing that has occurred liere worth writing to you since my last is a plot that has been for some time formed among the negroes to poison every white person in the country this hellish plot was luckily discovered before put into execution and for which we ought to be thankful to god we are now daily taking up the principal negroes of the different gangs some of the are hanged some burnt and others beheaded after being first strangled their heads are fixed on poles along the high roads as a warning to the rest  a friend of mine assured me that he was present some years ago at one of these horrid executions when a poor negro man was absolutely burnt alive the unfortunate man was fastened down to the ground with forked sticks drove into the earth and sire was placed at his feet and was gradually removed nearer to the vital parts as the limbs were consumed the poor fellow bore the exquisite torture without the least complaint looking great part of the time on those who stood near him with a sullen contempt   in short if the destruction of the human species which is annually occasioned by this cursed trade was to be fully and fairly estimated it would appear enormous and shocking it would appear that many more unfortunate human beings are annually sacrificed to mammon in the consequences of that iniquitous trade than were ever offered up by the philistines and other deluded votaries of baal moloch hercules etc so that the human sacrifices offered up to mammon by the british nation are undoubtedly more grateful to satan than those of the ancient heathens because they are more numerous  more banefully destructive to the human species how then if all these points be considered shall our wretched slavedealers and slaveholders persuade the world and themselves that they have not broken the covenant and served other gods   for the promised desolation of jerusalem  in the  0th verse the prophet begins to recite several predictions with which he had formerly been charged against zedekiahs brothers and predecessors who had been successively deprived of their royal dignity and were carried away in chains before him into a slayish captivity as i have before remarked but the hopeless slavery of his brother shallum shallum alias jehoahaz see   chronicles xxxvi   who was deposed put in bonds and carried away captive by pharaoh necho into egypt compare   kings xxiii    etc   in particular as well as the principal cause of it the prophet represented to him in very striking terms  weep ye not for the dead says he meaning josiah neither bemoan him the prophet here refers to the long mourning and lamentations which were continued for many years in remembrance of the death of the great and good king josiah the father of shallum as well as of zedekiah himself  see   chronicles xxxv    and all judah and jerusalem mourned for josiah and jeremiah lamented for josiah and all the singingmen and the singingwomen the minstrells of those ancient days spoke of josiah in their lamentations to this day and made them an ordinance in israel and behold they are written in the lamentations    but weep sore for him that goes away for he shall return no more nor see his native country for thus says the lord touching shallum the son of josiah king of judah which reigned instead of josiah his father which went forth out of this place he shall not return thither any more but he shall die in the place whither they have led him captive and shall see this land no more and then the prophet immediately refers us to the principal causes of gods severity against the royal house woe unto him says he that builds his house by unrighteousness and his chambers by wrong that uses his neighbors service without wages and gives him not for his work a clear description of the abominable wickedness of slavery that says i will build me a wide house and large chambers and cutteth him out windows and it is cieled with cedar and painted with vermilion for the monarch but whether shallum or jehoiakim is not clearly declared commentators in general have supposed that the oppression and injustice of jehoiakim is here referred to by the prophet but as shallum also did evil in the fight of the lord   kings xxiii    it is not improbable that both these monarchs might have been guilty of similar oppression and that the crime of shallum might have been thus represented to jehoiakim as a warning to himself when this prophecy was first of all delivered soon after shallum was carried into captivity nevertheless it is only introduced in this   d chapter as a reproach made in the presence of zedekiah which i hope i have already proved    was more careful it seems to display all the elegances and ornaments of architecture and the other polite arts in sumptuous buildings etc than he was to maintain the laws of equity and natural right but the prophet adds  shall thou reign because thou closest thyself in cedar did not thy father eat and drink and do judgment and justice and then it was well with him but no longer for as soon as josiah had undertaken an unjust war against pharaoh necho who previously warned him of the folly and injustice of it god gave him and his people who were wicked enough to concur with him in his unlawful enterprise into the hands of their enemies upon the very first encounter  see the text at large necho king of egypt came up to fight against charchemish by euphrates then probably belonging to the assyrian empire and josiah went out against him but he necho sent ambassadors to him saying what have i to do with thee thou king of judah  i come not against thee this day but against the house wherewith i have war for god commanded me to make haste forbear thee from meddling with god who is with me that he destroy thee not nevertheless josiah would not turn his face from him but disguised himself that he might fight with him and hearkened not unto the words of necho from the mouth of god and came to fight in the valley of megiddo and the archers shot at king josiah and the king said to his servants have me away for i am sore wounded his servants therefore took him out of that chariot and put him into the second chariot that he had and they brought him to jerusalem and he died and was buried in one of the sepulchers of his fathers   chronicles xxxv  0 to    see also esdras i    etc this judgment against josiah for undertaking an unjust war is the more remarkable because god had promised him by huldah the prophetess that he should be gathered to his grave in peace etc   chronicles xxxiv    but the promise was plainly conditional  god does not deprive men of their free will  josiah had it absolutely in his own power to have availed himself of the promise by persisting in righteousness god did not bring the evil upon him nothing but his own royal will and pleasure in commencing an unjust war against which he was even expressly warned the promise however through the mercy of god may nevertheless be said to have been fulfilled for when josiah was worsted before necho the conqueror did not pursue his advantage over the wounded monarch to prevent his escape from the field of battle as might naturally have been expected on such an occasion nor continued the war till more than three months afterward which circumstance may certainly be esteemed providential so that josiah was carried to jerusalem and may truly be said to have died in peace surrounded by his friends and was buried with the most solemn royal pomp in the sepulcher of his fathers    he judged the cause of the poor and needy then it was well with him was not this to know me says the lord but thine eyes and thine heart are not but for covetousness and for to shed innocent blood and for oppression and for violence to do it therefore that is for all these aggravating circumstances of tyranny thus said the lord concerning jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah and not thus says for the present tense is not proper in this place they shall not lament for him saying ah my brother or ah sister they shall not lament for him saying ah lord or ah his glory according to the general lamentations that had been made for his father josiah but on the contrary he shall be buried with the burial of an ass drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of jerusalem concerning the completion of this prophecy see pages         00    etc next in order after a short personal address to the nation concerning the certainty of gods vengeance and the destruction of her pastors and lovers the prophet repeats the judgment that had before been denounced against coniah the son of jehoiakim and nephew as well as predecessor to zedekiah the reigning monarch when this remonstrance was made   as i live said and not says the lord though coniah the son of jehoiakim king of judah were the signet upon my right hand yet would i pluck thee thence and i will give thee into the hand of them that seck thy life and into the hand of them whose face thou fear even into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and into the hand of the chaldaeans and i will cast thee out and thy mother that bare thee into another country where ye were not born and there shall ye die but the land whereunto they desire to return thither shall they not return the prophet then probably appealed to zedekiah concerning the unhappy fate of the person whose sentence of condemnation he had just been repeating   is this man coniah says he a despised broken idol is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure wherefore are they cast out he and his seed and are cast the prophet speaks of coniah as already cast out  wherefore are they cast out  so that it is manifest he could not be upon the throne of david when this remonstrance was made and consequently none but zedekiah could then be the reigning monarch   into a land which they know not for he plainly speaks of their being cast out as an event already past wherefore are they cast out etc and if we consider the question as being put to zedekiah the then reigning monarch it contains great severity for if zedekiah had consideration enough left to reflect wherefore coniah and his seed were cast out he must necessarily be struck with the justice of his own condemnation which the prophet was about to pronounce with a most awful and alarming introduction  o earth earth earth hear the word of the lord thus says the lord write ye this man childless a man that shall not prosper in his days for no man of his seed shall prosper sitting upon the throne of david and ruling any more in judah  had zedekiah been much more abandoned than he really was yet these dreadful judgments so solemnly pronounced in his own house or palace and even before the whole court could not well have failed to affect him for the present the following chapter seems likewise to have been delivered at the same time in the presence of zedekiah and his whole court and was probably a part of the remonstrance though the learned archbishop usher attributes to the   d chapter a different date from that which i suppose to be the true one and applies the severe sentence at the latter end of it viz write ye this man childish to jehoiachin which i hope i have already proved to be applicable to none but zedekiah yet he was convinced that the following chapter was delivered at the same time with the   d hoc tempore sequentis quoque capitis xxiii jeremiae prophetia edita fuisse videtur ad a m  0   p        for after declaring woe to the wicked pastors woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture says the lord therefore thus says the lord god of israel against the pastors that feed my people ye have scattered my flock and driven them away and have not visited them behold i will visit upon you the evil of your doings says the lord etc jer xxiii     this should teach princes the extreme danger of arbitrary modes of government and that when they presume to rule by the indirect means of bribery and corruption or by open military force and standing armies instead of law and national right or agreeable to the scripture phrase instead of judgment and righteousness they may too truly be said to destroy and scatter the sheep of gods pasture and consequently may expect the same condemnation viz that the lord will visit upon them the evil of their doings    probably meaning the wretched kings pastors says the learned dr lowth in his commentary on this text comprehend both civil and ecclesiastical governors  aut potius says the learned michaelis set sehm qui priorem hujus cap partem a v      praecedenti vaticinio contra reges judae advectit regibus coll c xxii    ita quoque kimchi aliique et boc pacto evidentior fit oppositio de christo rege etc and in his preface to the book of jeremiah after speaking of the   d chapter to which indeed he attributes a different date to that which i suppose to be the true one he adds  ei vero connexum est sequens c xxiii quippe quod itidem directum est contra malos pastores seu reges v   contra quos c xxii   beforementioned of the house of david who had neglected to execute judgment and righteousness and to relieve the oppressed jeremiah takes occasion prophetically to draw the character of the good pastor eco sum pastor bonus etc i am the good shepherd the good shepherd gives his life for the sheep etc john x       the true shepherd of israel he shall feed his flock like a shepherd etc isaiah xl    the shepherd here mentioned is the lord god or the lord jehovah  spoken of in the preceding verse whose reward was with him and his work before him that is when he came into the world in a visible form    whom god would afterward raise up even from the same stock the house of david to execute judgment and righteousness in the land compare jer xxxiii       with chapter xxiii and this is expressed in such opposite terms to the character of the reigning prince zedekiah then doomed to destruction that a contrasted allusion seems very clearly to have been intended  behold the days come says the lord jehovah that i will raise unto david a righteous branch whereas the royal branch that had just been condemned in the preceding chapter was most unrighteous and a king shall reign and prosper whereas the former wretched kings were pulled down from their thrones and carried into captivity for the neglect of justice and right but the promised king shall execute judgment and justice in the earth which was the constant lesson the necessity of maintaining justice and richteousness in political government as well as in private life is so clearly laid down in the holy scriptures that one would think it impossible that so many people who profess to believe the revealed word of god should nevertheless suffer themselves to be deluded by the sophistical arguments of those unbelievers who assert that vices are necessary to render a state great and flourishing and that political government cannot well be carried on without sometimes doing evil that good may come but these notions are so far from being true that the contrary is clearly demonstrable  name any nation says an accurate and careful observer of the several histories of mankind that was ever remarkable for justice for temperance and severity of manners for piety and religion though it was in a wrang way that did not always thrive and grow great in the world and that did not always enjoy a plentiful portion of all those things which are accounted to make a nation happy and flourishing and on the other side when that nation has declined from its former virtue and grown impious and dissolute in manners we appeal to experience whether it has not likewise always proportionably sunk in its success and good fortunes archbishop sharps sermons   vol  th sermon entitled  virtue and religion the only means to make a nation prosperous which was preached before the house of commons    may    0 p  0    th ed    indeed to zedekiah and his brothers etc and was as constantly by them neglected in his days continues the prophet judah shall be saved and israel shall dwell safely whereas under zedekiah their desolation was completed and this is his name whereby he shall be called the lord our righteousness i e  jehovah tsadeknou which is the name of zedekiah or tsadekjehov transposed with the small addition of the pronominal termination nou for our viz jehovahtsadeknou instead of tsadekjehov the latter signifying jehovah is righteous for this name was put upon zedekiah by the babylonian conqueror to remind him of the solemn oath he had taken in the name of god  this manifest contrasted allusion to zedekiah makes it seem very probable that the prophecies of this   d chapter were also pronounced in the presence of zedekiah and his court at the same time that jeremiah went down to the house of the king of judah to declare the solemn message or remonstrance contained in the   d chapter the learned grotius indeed conceived that the message may be extended even to the   th chapter haec omnia says he speaking of the prophecies of jeremiah from the words vae pastoribus in the   d chapter to the   th chapter inclusive usque ad caput    commemorationem continent ab jeremia factam apud sedeciam de sermonil us ante sedeciae tempora diversis locis ac temporibus a se habitis ac congruentibus cum iis qua nunc sedeciae dicere coeperal ut dei in decretis suis et aequitas et constantia magis apparent ut jam aliquoties diximus crit sacr tom   p         but i am thoroughly convinced that it cannot with propriety be extended beyond this   d chapter because the prophecies in the following chapter the   th under the type of two baskets of figs were delivered as the prophet himself informs us after that nebuchadrezzar king of babylon had carried away captive jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah with the carpenters etc  and had brought them to babylon that is  soon after the said remarkable period or else the mentioning that public calamity as a chronological circumstance to mark the time for that is the apparent purpose of it would have been nugatory and consequently we may be assured that the prophecies in the   th chapter were declared in the very beginning of zedekiahs reign whereas the   st and   d chapters and probably the   d also were not revealed till the siege was begun as i have already shown that is  not till the  th year of that monarch the dates likewise of the prophecies in several of the following chapters are also exactly noted in the text to be different from the time supposed by gratius as for instance  a prior date is expressly assigned to the   th chapter  it being entitled the word that came to jenemiah concerning all the people of judah in the  th year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah that was the first year of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and again the two next chapters viz the   th and part of the   th though posterior with refpect to the order of the book have exact dates assigned them which are prior even to the   th and   th chapters for they are expressly declared to have been revealed in the beginning of the reign of jehoiakim etc the remainder of the   th chapter from the   th verse which the prophet addressed to zedekiah is as clearly to be attributed to the beginning of zedekiah s reign  because the circumstances related in the following chapter the   th are expressly said to have come to pass the same year in the beginning of the reign of zedekiah and the letter of jeremiah to the captives at babylon contained in the   th chapter is as clearly declared to have been wrote after that jeconiah the king etc were departed from jerusalem which was also  the beginning of the reign of zedekiah for the letters were sent by zedekiahs messengers see the  d verse so that the last mentioned supposition of the learned grotius cannot be true    it was probably on the first approach of the babylonian army  viz in the ninth year of zedekiah that the monarch sent messengers to consult the prophet and thereby occasioned this public remonstrance  the war was immediately carried on with vigor it seems in every part of the kingdom see the   th chapter the word which came unto jeremiah from the lord when nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion and all the people fought against ferusalem and against all the cities thereof jer xxiv i  so that a general attack seems to have been made at once in every part   and after some considerable progress had been made in it all the fenced cities being taken except three see the  th verse the prophet received a further command from god relating to king zedekiah saying thus says the lord  i e jehovah the god of israel go and speak to zedekiah king of judah and tell him thus says the lord behold i will give this city into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall burn it with fire and thou shall not escape out of his hand but shall surely be taken and delivered into his hand and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of babylon and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth that is when the king of babylon was to sit in judgment upon him and thou shall go to babylon etc the prophet however added a few words of comfort  yet hear the word of the lord o zedekiah king of judah thus says the lord of thee thou shall not die by the sword but thou shall die in peace that is a natural death and with the burnings of thy fathers the former kings which were before thee so shall they burn odours for thee and they will lament thee i e the jewish nation in captivity will lament thee saying ah lord for i have pronounced the word says the lord then jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words unto zedekiah king of judah in ferusalem when the king of babylons army fought against jerusalem and against all the cities of judah that were left against lachish and against azokah for these defenced cities remained of the cities of judah verses   to       these repeated denunciations of vengeance with the horrors of the growing dangers from the successful enemy before their eyes every way round jerusalem at length so far shook the firmness of that stubborn monarch that he began to show some signs of remorse and as i have already shown that the oppression of the poor was one of the principal causes though there were many others also assigned by the almighty for casting off his people and sending them into captivity  punishing tyranny with slavery so even this wicked monarch zedekiah who never thought of law or justice in his prosperity was now it seems become sensible that a public act of justice and mercy toward the oppressed poor that were then detained by his opulent subjects in a miserable involuntary servitude would be the most grateful act of reformation and the most acceptable sacrifice in the sight of a merciful god and consequently the most effectual means to avert the national destruction which was then advancing with dreadful strides and accordingly we find that he actually prevailed the text informs us that the king zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which were at jerusalem to proclaim liberty unto them that every man should let his manservant and every man his maidservant being an hebrew or hebrewess go free that none should serve himself of them to wit of a jew his brother and it is probable that this was the kings own proposal though perhaps at the suggestion of the prophet to fulfill the law because in the following verse it is said that all the princes and all the people heard that they should let their manservant etc go free  they obeyed  and these terms hearing and obeying seem to imply that neither the princes nor the people were the proposers of the equitable mensure  now says the text when all the princes and all the people which had entered into the covenant heard that every one should let his manservant and every one his maidservant go free that none should serve themselves of them any more then they obeyed and let them go chap xxxiv   to  0   upon his princes and people to proclaim liberty to their poor brethren in bondage and this proclamation of liberty was a public act of the state communi decreto says grotius upon the place statuerat impleri quod lex jubebat sed judaei non observaverant vide exodus xxi   deuteronomy xv       for not only the king but all the princes and all the people bound themselves in a most solemn covenant to comply with the terms of the proclamation viz that every man should let his manservant and every man his maidservant being an hebrew or hebrewess go free etc  th verse    which was also agreeable to an ancient ordinance of their law and ye shall hallow the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you etc levit xxv  0    now to confirm all that i have hitherto asserted concerning the principal causes of gods anger against the jews my readers are earnestly requested to remark that this material reformation was accepted by the almighty who even condescended to signify by his prophet that the people had done right in his sight in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbor ver    and had the jewish government at that time persevered in this necessary act of justice and brotherly love they might probably as charity covers a multitude of sins have received grace for a further amendment and might have obtained a mitigation or at least a respite or postponing of those dreadful judgments which had long been denounced by the prophets against that devoted nation but alas the just decrees were confirmed on account of the want of sincerity and the deplorable impenitence on their part for no sooner was the appearance of gods approaching vengeance withdrawn by the sudden retreat of the chaldaeans from the siege on the approach of pharaohs army then pharaohs army was come forth out of egypt and when the chaldeans that besieged jerusalem heard tidings of them they departed from jerusalem chap xxxvii   see also   th verse at which time says grotius the king and the princes repealed the popular decree concerning liberty mentioned in the   th chap  quo tempore says he rex et principes resciderunt decretum de popularium liberate ut habuimus c     when the army of the chaldeans was broken up from jerusalem for fear of pharaohs army    see chap xxxvii than the wretched tyrannical masters who could not repent of their enormous oppressions yet speedily repented of their temporary benevolence and being themselves entangled in a much more dangerous bondage through their abominable avarice under that old slaveholder and hard taskmaster the devil they wickedly renewed their former iniquitous claims of private property in the persons of their poor brethren and caused the servants and the handmaids whom they had let go free to return and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids jer xxxiv    perhaps they thought to excuse themselves like our modern african merchants and american planters by pleading the necessity of tolerating slavery and the exaction of involuntary service viz that the profit arising therefrom was necessary for their support and that husbandry and other laborious business could not be performed at so cheap a rate by free hired servants as by slaves but whether such reasons as these or others of greater weight were then alleged is not material it is sufficient for the present argument to be certain that whatever were their pretenses or excuses for enslaving their brethren they did only deceive themselves and hasten the vengeance of almighty god upon their own heads for they were very soon afterward delivered up into the hands of their enemies the babylonian tyrants under whom their countrymen that had been carried away in the former captivities experienced in their own proper persons the deplorable condition of slaves being a most just punishment for that tyranny and unreasonable vassalage with which they so unlawfully oppressed their poor brethren such was their crime i mean their principal crime or at least one of those crimes which was most abominable in the sight of a merciful god for they were indeed notoriously guilty of idolatry and many other detestable crimes besides this and such their retaliated punishment which was inflicted expressly on that account  therefore says the text so that the reason of gods interposition is manifest the word of the lord came to jeremiah from the lord saying thus says the lord jehovah the god of israel i made a covenant with your fathers in the day that i brought them forth out of the land of egypt out of the house of bondmen a circumstance which they were frequently commanded never to forget as i have before remarked but sympathetically to learn mercy thereby but thou shall remember that thou wast a bondsman in egypt and the lord thy god redeemed thee thence therefore i command thee to do this thing deuteronomy xxiv       also c xv    and xvi    etc etc    saying at the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an hebrew which has been sold unto thee and when he has served thee six years thou shall let him go free from thee but your fathers hearkened not unto me neither inclined their ear and ye were now turned and had done right in my sight in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbor mark this ye sordid tyrants of the earth the almighty lord of the universe has condescended to inform you that the proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbor and all men without distinction are at this day to be esteemed your neighbors and brethren is right in his sight    and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name but ye turned and polluted my name and caused every man his servant and every man his handmaid whom he had set at liberty at their pleasure or to their mind or will to return and brought them into subjection to be unto you for servants and for handmaids therefore now mark the punishment ye wretched slaveholders and advocates for private property in the persons of men thus says the lord jehovah ye have not hearkened unto me in proclaiming liberty every one to his brother and every man to his neighbor behold i proclaim a liberty for you says the lord significantly marking his detestation of slaveholding by an ironical repetition of that opposite measure the proclaiming of liberty which they had neglected and therefore god himself proclaimed a different kind of liberty  liberty to the sword to the pestilence and to the famine here is a proclamation of liberty with a vengeance but alas the hardened jewish slaveholders like englishmen nowadays were too wicked to take warning and i will make you says the lord to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth that is to be led away into captivity by their enemies slavery being a very just as well as common punishment for tyrants and i will give the men that have transgressed my covenant which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me when they cut the calf in twain and passed between the parts thereof for in making the covenant before god in the temple to proclaim liberty as mentioned in the   th verse they divided the victim in two parts and passed between the parts in imitation of the solemn covenant which god made with abraham when a smoking furnace and a lamp of fire passed between the pieces of the divided heifer she goat etc as mentioned in genesis xv   to    signifying says vatablus  that they wish to be put to death as this calf was cut asunder if they break the covenant  in federe pangendo dividebant vitulum et per medium transibant significantes se optare emori ut ille vitulus erat caesus si fedus frangerent crit sac tom     0  nam significabat says munster ritus ille ut si quis dolo malo discessisset a pollicitis illum quoque secaret dominus et occideret horrende crit sac       and clarius gives a part of the words used on those occasions ordo orationis says he est dabo viros qui praevaricantur fedus meum sicut vitulum quem conciderunt etc in templo enim immolarant ritu celeberrimo diviso vitulo per cujus parts utrinque oppositas incedebant simulque jurabant et se devovabant ut eveniret ipsis sicut vitulo si fedus rumperent dicit ergo  dabo vos sicut vitulum illum etc    the princes of judah and the prince of jerusalem the eunuchs and the priests and all the people of the land which passed between the parts of the calf i will even give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of them that seek their life and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven and to the beasts of the earth manifestly alluding to the heavy curse to which with their own consent they had rendered themselves liable by their breach of the solemn covenant viz that they should be slain as the calf was when they made the covenant and their dead bodies be left like the divided parts of the calf to the fowls of the air etc for in the description of that solemn rite in genesis we read that  the fowls came down upon the carcases and  abram drove them away genesis xv       and zedekiah king of judah and the princes will i give into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of them that seek their life here is a distinct repetition of a part of the same judgment against the king and princes though it does not appear that the king himself was actually guilty of slaveholding however it seems he neglected to enforce the laws of the land in behalf of the injured poor and by suffering others with impunity to hold their brethren in an unnatural bondage he become a party in the oppression and of course a sharer of the punishment o that modern kings who in any degree consent to the toleration of slavery in their dominions would think of this tremendous example and exert every royal prerogative that they are legally invested with in restraining their princes and people from oppressing their poor brethren in maintaining the natural rights of mankind and in defending the poor from the rich the weak from the strong by ballancing the power of the nobles or rich landholders by the official power of the crown in behalf of the just rights of the common people these are the most essential purposes of regal government and royal prerogative which surely can never be exerted either so profitably or so safely on any other occasions whatsoever for it is by strict justice or righteousness alone that a kings throne can be truly and safely established and not by refined sophistical politics mercenary armies or parliamentary corruption    and into the hand continued the prophet of the king of babylons army which are gone up from you for the withdrawing of the babylonian army was a very recent instance of gods mercy which rendered more notorious the ingratitude of those who so immediately broke the solemn covenant of proclaiming liberty but gods vengeance kept pace with the oppression of the unrepenting tyrants behold i will command says the lord and cause them to return to this city a remarkable instance of gods overruling providence in the world the haughty selfwilled babylonian monarch and his men of war perceived not that they were mere instruments in the hands of god and they shall fight against it and take it and burn it with fire and i will make the cities of judah a desolation without an inhabitant jer xxxiv  there is no order of time preserved in the collection of jeremiahs prophecies as i have already remarked for the two next chapters  viz the   th and   th contain prophecies which were delivered several years before in the reign of jehoiakim but the   th chapter relates to the same time exactly as the   th chapter last quoted viz the times when pharaohs army was come forth out of egypt xxxvii   which occasioned the departure for the present of the chaldeans and it was probably in the interval between these two circumstances  viz after pharaoh was come forth from egypt and was advancing but before the chaldeans left the siege on that account that zedekiah sent two messengers to the prophet who was then at liberty as the  th verse expressly declares to desire his prayers  pray now unto the lord our god for us but the prophets answer on that occasion was not returned till the chaldeans departed from jerusalem as mentioned in the  th verse and probably also not till after the covenant about liberty was broken  then came the wor of the lord to jeremiah saying thus says the lord the god of israel thus shall ye say to the king of judah that sent you unto me to enquire of me behold pharaohs army which is come forth to help you shall return to egypt into their own land and the chaldeans shall come again and fight against this city and take it and burn it with fire thus says the lord deceive not yourselves saying the chaldeans shall surely depart from us for they shall not depart for though ye had smitten the whole army of the chaldeans that fight against you and there remained but wounded men among them now mark how impossible it is for slaveholders to stand before their enemies yet should they that is the wounded men rise up every man in his tent and burn this city with fire chapter xxxvii to ver  0  it was also during this recess of the babylonian army that the prophet was put into prison by the princes for taking that opportunity to attempt his escape from jerusalem see chapter xxxvii         afterward for he remained in prison many days as we read in the   th verse   zedekiah the king sent and took him out and the king asked him secretly in his house and said is there any word from the lord and jeremiah said there is for said he thou shall be delivered into the hand of the king of babylon etc chapter xxxvii     the prophet also took this opportunity of remonstrating to the king concerning his own case   moreover jeremiah said unto king zedekiah what have i offended against thee or against thy servants or against this people that ye have put me in prison this shows that speaking truth be it ever so severe provided it is not spoken for the sake of mere abuse but for the purposes of warning and amendment ought not to be esteemed an offense for surely no truths can ever be more harsh or severe than those uttered by jeremiah against the court of zedekiah    where are now your prophets which prophesied unto you saying the king of babylon shall not come against you nor against this land for these evil counselors it seems like true implements of the devil attempted by their false intelligence from time to time to make the king firm in his bad measures and wicked policy    therefore hear now i pray thee o my lord the king let my supplication i pray thee be accepted before thee that thou cause me not to return to the house of jonathan the scribe lest i die there and it appears that zedekiah notwithstanding his general wickedness yet had no personal pique against the prophet but was well inclined to grant his petition as also a daily allowance of bread as long as any could be procured  then says the text zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit jeremiah into the court of the prison and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers street until all the bread in the city were spent     and when the princes advised zedekiah to put jeremiah to death because he publicly exhorted all the people to go over to the enemy which would have been treason to the state and a high crime had not the kingdom been actually condemned by the word of god viz thus says the lord he that remains in this city shall die by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence but he that goes forth to the chaldeans shall live for he shall have his life for a prey and shall live thus says the lord this city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of babylons army which shall take it therefore the princes said unto the king we beseech thee let this man be put to death for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city and the hands of all the people in speaking such words unto them for this man seeks not the welfare of this people but the hurt etc chap xxxviii   to      it appears that though the king thought he had not sufficient authority to oppose their council yet he would not concern himself against the prophet to condemn him but only left him in their hands then zedekiah the king said behold he is in your hand for the king is not he that can do any thing against you chap xxxviii ver      and no sooner was the king informed of the dangerous situation of jeremiah from the malice and injustice of the princes my lord the king these men have done evil in all that they have done to jeremiah the prophet whom they have cast into the dungeon and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is for  there is no more bread in the city chap xxxviii ver      than he gave express orders to the generous and conscientious ethiopian who had represented the case to take a guard of thirty men and draw him up from the dungeon and he was placed in the court of the prison chap xxxviii  0      the king afterward sent for the prophet and had a private conference with him he also bound himself under a solemn oath that he would neither kill him nor give him up to his enemies and as he kept his promise notwithstanding that jeremiah still persevered in denouncing the most tremendous judgments against him and the whole kingdom it is manifest that the king had no personal resentment against the prophet being sensible probably by that time of jeremiahs sincerity and innocence as well as of the truth of his warnings though he had not grace and humility enough to submit himself to the only alternative from destruction which god was now pleased to offer him perhaps in consideration of his favor to jeremiah and which the prophet as affectionately pressed him to accept but in vain  these circumstances and several others will be found in the   th chapter  if thou will assuredly go forth unto the king of babylons princes then thy soul shall live and this city shall be burned with fire and thou shall live and thine house but if thou will not go forth to the king of babylons princes then shall this city be given into the hand of the chaldeans and they shall burn it with fire and thou shall not escape out of their hand and zedekiah the king said unto jeremiah i am afraid of the jews that are fallen to the chaldeans left they deliver me into their hand and they mock me but jeremiah said they shall not deliver thee obey i beseech thee the voice of the lord which i speak unto thee so it shall be well unto thee and thy soul shall live etc chap xxxviii ver    to  0 the remainder of the chapter contains a further description of the judgments that were to take place in case ho refused to accept of the alternative above mentioned as also an account of zedekiahs expedient for concealing what had passed between him and jeremiah from the princes    but we must go back to the   d chapter for the continuation of the history which we there find advanced to the tenth year of zedekiahs reign the siege being still carried on and jeremiah still shut up in the court of the prison in the  d  th and  th verses we find a repetition of some circumstances of the dreadful vengeance before denounced against zedekiah but they are not mentioned in that place as being then repeated by the prophet but only as having been the cause of his confinement from the  th to the   th verse is related  the remarkable prophecy concerning the repossession of houses fields and vineyards after the captivity in token of which the prophets kinsman hanameel was providentially sent to tender to him the purchase of a field in anathoth to which he was next heir from the   th to the   th verse of this chapter is contained  the prophets prayer on that occasion wherein he most solemnly describes the mercy as well as the vengeance of god then dreadfully approaching  ah lord god behold thou have made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretchedout arm and there is nothing too hard for thee thou show loving kindness unto thousands and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after

delivered from the house of bondage and restored to their natural rights which nevertheless was since become notorious for the same kind of oppression that god had punished in egypt  for a crime which of all others must be most intolerable in the sight of the great redeemer from slavery it being not only a proof of the most shameful ingratitude but also a notorious breach of gods express command viz to remember that they themselves had been bondmen in egypt see deuteronomy xv    xvi    xxiv    and       and among other men amongst other nations also gods vengeance against tyrants and oppressors has been manifested some examples of which shall hereafter be inserted    and have made thee a name as at this day viz the day or time that god recompensed the jews according to their ways the dreadful storm of gods vengeance against jerusalem being then begun which was not to cease till the whole was laid desolate and have brought thy people israel out of the land of egypt with signs and with wonders and with a strong hand and with a stretchedout arm and with great terror for that wonderful example of gods vengeance against tyranny and of his mercy in redeeming a nation from

and they came in and possessed it but they obeyed not thy voice neither walked in thy law they have done nothing of all that thou command them to do therefore thou have caused all this evil to come upon them the prophet then proceeds to describe the terrors of the siege which were at that time present before his eyes  behold the mounts said he  they are come unto the city to take it etc and after reciting some other causes of gods anger against his people as disobedience idolatry etc and declaring the certainty of the desolation that would follow he once more promises a happy return to their own land which is also again repeated in the following chapter xxxiii with the additional promise of the branch of righteousness to grow up unto david that should execute judgment and righteousness  which zedekiah had so notoriously neglected for on these terms alone could the jews be permitted to remain in possession of their own land  if ye thoroughly amend your ways and your

vii     a plain declaration this that they might for ever have enjoyed that national establishment which god had given them no foreign armaments could have had power to deprive them of gods gift had not their own iniquities deprived them of gods protection it was the neglect of justice and natural right or according to the scripture phrase of judgment and righteousness which drew down gods vengeance upon them this was apparently the principal cause let britain therefore tremble for her notorious national corruption and oppressions of that horrid misery which reigned in jerusalem during the babylonian siege  they that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills lam iv   and again they that be slain with the sword are better than they that be slain with hunger for these pine away stricken through for want of the fruits of the field the hands of the pitiful or rather of the affectionate or tender hearted women have sodden that is boiled for want of other food their own children they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people ibid ver    0  a more deplorable state of wretchedness cannot be described these miseries increased till the   th year of zedekiah when as we read in the   th chapter  the city was broken up and it came to pass that when zedekiah the king of judah saw them that is princes of babylon who sat in the middle gate after the city was broken up see chapter xxxix     and all the men of war then they fled and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the kings garden by the gate between the two walls and he went out the way of the plain but the chaldeans army pursued after them and overtook zedekiah in the plains of jericho and when they had taken him they brought him up to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon to riblah in the land of hamath where he gave judgment upon him chapter xxxix     compare this with the note in page       and then was the dreadful vengeance so repeatedly denounced by the prophet against zedekiah ready to burst on the head of that wicked prince who in addition to all his other crimes had so lately violated the solemn covenant of proclaiming liberty to the bond servants by neglecting to enforce the laws of god and of his country in behalf of the poor oppressed people that had been compelled by their petty tyrants to return into bondage  this was so notorious a contempt of justice and righteousness like the toleration of slavery in the british empire that gods vengeance before denounced was inevitably confirmed and the king was soon afterward delivered up with all his nobles and men of war that remained into the hands of their enraged enemies agreeable to the just decree of god before recited from the   th chapter his sons were slain before his eyes then the king of babylon flew the sons of zedekiah in riblah before his eyes also the king of babylon slew all the nobles of judah chap xxxix   see also chap lii  0    and his eyes beheld the eyes of the stern tyrant of babylon as the prophet jeremiah had very circumstantially foretold thou shall not escape out of his hand but shall surely be taken and delivered into his hand and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of babylon and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth and thou shall go to babylon etc chap xxxiv      but he never saw more for his eyes were put out by the order of the implacable conqueror moreover he put out zedekiahs eyes and bound him with chains to carry him to babylon chap xxxix   and in the   d chapter where these circumstances are repeated we find the following addition viz that the king of babylon carried him to babylon and put him in prison to the day of his death chap lii       who thereby fulfilled another not less remarkable prophecy of ezekiel to the captives at babylon telling them from god i will bring him to babylon the land of the chaldeans yet shall he not see it though be shall die there ezekiel xii    now to complete this tremendous example of gods judgment against the toleration of slavery i must add that the king of babylon slew all the nobles of judah that is all that were taken at that time and having put out zedekiahs eyes as beforementioned he bound him  slavelike with chains to carry him to babylon where he and the remainder of the jewish captives the former slaveholders whose oppression he had unjustly tolerated became according to the phrase of our modern slaveholders the private property of the babylonian tyrant and his soldiers they took the young men to grind and the children fell under the wood lam v    in the same chapter the miseries of a foreign jurisdiction are strongly delineated  our inheritance is turned to strangers our houses to aliens we are orphans and fatherless our mothers are as widows we have drunken our water for money our wood is sold unto us our necks are under persecution we labor and have no rest etc a just recompense for slaveholders and again  servants or slaves have ruled over us etcmdash they ravished the women in sion and the maids in the cities of judah princes are hanged by their hand the faces of elders were not honored they took the young men to grind and the children fell under the wood etc such a retaliation of tyranny must every nation expect that promotes and tolerates slavery and oppression nothing but severe repentance and amendment can prevent it o that my countrymen would consider this    under the heavy burdens of their babylonian slaveholders but what is still more remarkable the poor of the people who were probably the bondmen and bondwomen whose cause god had avenged by these heavy judgments were left at home to possess the lands and vineyards of their former tyrannical masters for nebuzaradan the captain of the guard lest of the poor of the people which had nothing in the land of judah and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time jer xxxix  0  now if the african traders west india merchants and american planters could make it appear that their imaginary property in negro slaves for which they so strenuously contend is as justly acquired as the property in hebrew captives which the babylonians acquired by their providential success in the jewish war yet this would not afford them any just excuse or comfort for their wounded consciences if they should ever have grace to feel remorse because it appears that this very bondage of the jews though apparently according to their deserts brought upon the chaldeans in their turn the same deplorable slavish condition which they like our modern slaveholders thought they had an undoubted right to impose on their imaginary property the jewish captives  and yet nebuehadnezzar did not burn and depopulate the cities of judaea merely for the sake of procuring slaves like the black accomplices of the royal african company his war was just and honorable he came to punish a rebellious and wicked tributary nation which had without any just reason and contrary to the express commands of god by the prophets attempted to shake off their allegiance to the babylonian empire to which they had long been subject for the wicked jewish king manasseh the son of king hezekiah had long before been conquered and carried into captivity to babylon and the lord spoke to mauasseh and to his people but they would not hearken wherefore the lord brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of assyria which took manasseh among the thorns and bound him with fetters and carried him to babylon   chronicles xxxiii  0       by the king of assyria according to bishop usher this king of assyria was esarhaddon who as he relates annexed the dominion of judaea to the imperial crown of assyria and carried king manasseh to babylon but upon his repentance mercifully restored him to his royal dignity though he was still to remain subject to the imperial jurisdiction of assyria and afterward when the whole assyrian power devolved to nebuchadnezzar in the commencement of the babylonian empire jehoiakim king of judah became his servant three years and then turned and rebelled against him   kings xxiv    but the kingdom being again conquered a few years after in the reign of his son jehoiachin the king of babylon carried the latter into captivity and made zedekiah king in his room who also rebelled both against god and the king of babylon and thereby wilfully drew down those heavy judgments upon himself and the kingdom    and the assyrian power afterward devolved to nebuchadnezzar in the commencement of the babylonian empire who had also himself thrice before this last war conquered judea and zedekiah the last monarch before the captivity reigned expressly by his appointment so that his wilful rebellion clearly justified the babylonian invasion and add to this that the assyrians o assyria the rod of mine anger and the staff in their hand is mine indignation i will send him against a hypocritical nation and against the people of my wrath will i give him a charge to take the spoil and to take the prey and to tread them down like the mire of the streets howbeit he means not so neither does his heart think so but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few etc isaiah x       and babylonians and now i have given all these lands into the hand of nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon my servant etc  and all nations shall serve him and his sons son until the very time of his land come and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him etc jer xxvii      here is a manifest instance of national retribution in kind   were in a very extraordinary manner preordained and authorized by almighty god to punish the crying wickedness of the israelites and jews which surely may be alleged as a further justification of the conquest and subsequent right of service if it may be esteemed a right which both assyrians and babylonians seemed to have acquired thereby  but notwithstanding all these remarkable circumstances which rendered the claims of these eastern nations to the jewish captives infinitely more equitable than any claims that our modern slaveholders can produce in favor of their unnatural oppression of the poor wretched captives of africa yet both assyrians and babylonians as well as all the other neighboring nations that were guilty of the like oppressions drew down upon themselves a severe national retribution of vengeance for presumptuously enslaving and oppressing each other for though they were instruments in gods hand for the mutual punishment of each other and acted expressly by his permission for that purpose yet the causes of action which they themselves were capable of perceiving and by which they were apparently moved were very different  avarice pride lust of power the unjust dictates of wicked and corrupt hearts were the only personal motives but the almighty can turn even these evils to his own glory for the execution of his eternal justice and in due time will excute vengeance even on the instruments of his vengeance  wherefore it shall come to pass says isaiah in the  0th chapter that when the lord has performed his whole work upon mount zion and on jerusalem i will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of assyria and the glory of his high looks for he says  by the strength of my hand i have done it and by my wisdom for i am prudent and i have removed the bounds of the people and have robbed their treasures and have put down or enslaved the inhabitants like a valiant man and my hand has found as a nest the riches of the people and as one gathers eggs that are left have i gathered all the earth and there was none that moved the wing or opened the mouth or peeped  shall the ax boast itself against him that heweth therewith or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shakes it thus god asserts the actual guidance of his providence in human transactions by representing the haughty unbelieving monarchs of assyria as mere work tools in his hands as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up or as if the staff should lift up itself as if it were no wood therefore shall the lord the lord of hosts or armies jehovah tsabaouth send among his sat ones leanness and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire etc chap x         and after encouraging the remnant of israel to stay upon the lord the holy one of israel in truth by a promise that the consumption decreed that is  decreed on account of the national injustice and tyranny described in the  st verse of the same chapter viz woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees i e make laws that are contrary to natural right and justice laws like those whereby the african slave trade is promoted and encouraged or like those whereby marriage is restrained like those also which tolerate the oppression of the poor colliers salters and miners in scotland or like those diabolical decrees of unrighteousness and grievousness which some of our american assemblies have wickedly prescribed against their poor negro slaves many of which i have particularly pointed out in my representation against slavery pages    to      and that write grievousness which they have prescribed to turn aside the needy from judgment and to take away the right from the poor of my people that widows may be their prey and that they may rob the fatherless and what will ye do in the day of visitation and in the desolation which shall come from far etc  which was manifestly the consumption decreed etc   shall overflow with righteousness for the promises of blessings and forgiveness are generally blended with the denunciations of gods judgments in order to encourage repentance and reliance on god the prophet comforts the sufferers under the present affliction with an assurance that it shall not be of long continuance therefore thus says the lord god of hosts o my people that dwell in zion be not afraid of the assyrian he shall smite thee with a rod and shall lift up his staff against thee after the manner of egypt that is by holding them in a severe bondage as the egyptians had formerly done in via aegypti  hebraismus pro more ritu aegyptiorum eo modo quo afflixerunt te aegyptii sic te affligent assyrii  vatablus  caedet ille quidem te baculo suaque virga petet aegyptiaco more  ut olim pharao castalio  sicut olim in aegypto servierunt et abea tandem servitute liberati clarius crit sac    for yet a very little while said the prophet and the indignation shall cease and mine anger in their destruction and the lord of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him  viz the assyrian according to the slaughter of midian at the rock of oreb  viz by the militia of israel under gideon and as his rod was upon the sea so shall he lift it up after the manner of egypt sicut inquit olim aquis rubri maris aegyptios prostravi sola baculi elevatione per mosen etc clarius crit sac    and it shall come to pass in that day that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder and his yoke from off thy neck and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing etc again in the   th chapter a similar prophecy is delivered against assyria  i will break the assyrian in my land and upon my mountains tread him under foot and then he immediately alludes to the cruel bondage and oppression which drew down the vengeance of god upon the assyrian  then said the prophet shall his yoke depart from off them and his burden depart from off their shoulders this vengeance came upon the assyrians not all at once but at several different periods that they might have warning and opportunity to repent one remarkable instance of it is fully recorded in scripture i mean that supernatural destruction of the greatest part of their army in one night after sennacherib had blasphemed god by his captains and presumptuously proposed to carry away the inhabitants of jerusalem into captivity for that was expressly his purpose as signified by rabshakah  make an agreement with me by a present and come out to me and eat etc until i come and take you away to a land like your own land etc at another time pharaoh necho was charged with the execution of gods vengeance against them compare   kings xxiii    with   chronicles xxxv    etc after which time we hear no more of the assyrian oppressor that monarchy being soon after swallowed up in the babylonian tyranny so that his yoke of course departed from off the nations he had enslaved and his burden from off their shoulders agreeable to the prophesy above   this is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations etc chap xiv        this seems to be a declaration that gods vengeance against assyria for tyranny and oppression we to thee that spoilest and thou wast not spoiled and dealest treacherously and they dealt not treacherously with thee when thou shall cease to spoil thou shall be spoiled and when thou shall make an end to deal treacherously they shall deal treacherously with thee isaiah xxxiii   here the law of retribution is clearly laid down commentators have generally understood this to be denounced against assyria   should be a standing example and precedent for the judgment of all other nations but more especially of the nations bordering on judea because there are several other prophecies concerning the neighboring nations which sufficiently correspond with this example of vengeance against assyria both as to the mode and principal cause sufficiently i say to prove that a similar fate to that of assyria was the purpose that was purposed upon the whole earth  for behold says the prophet joel chap iii in those days and in that time when i shall bring again the captivity of judah and jerusalem i will also gather all nations and will bring them down into the valley of jehoshaphat signifying jehovah is judge or has judged and will plead with them there for my people and for my heritage israel whom they have scattered among the nations and parted my land and now the prophet proceeds to mark the scandal of trading in slaves in strong ironical terms and they have cast lots a poor negroe whom i was so happy as to assist in procuring his freedom was won i am informed by his last master in virginia at a game of cards or some other such mode of casting lots   says he for my people and have given a boy for a harlot and sold a girl for wine that they might drink yea and what have ye to do with me o tire and zidon the liverpool and bristol the slave trade carried on at these two places so far exceeds that which is chargeable to the great metropolis i mean more especially in proportion to the immense general commerce of the latter that the guilt of london in that particular at least is very inconsiderable when compared with the accumulated iniguity and bloodshed for which the inhabitants of the other two places must inevitably be accountable if they do not repent see the comparative state of the slave trade in page       of palestine that were then become infamous by harboring the most eminent merchants in the slave trade of those days   will ye render me a recompense mark this ye opulent african merchants  what recompense can ye make for such an abominable affront to the creator of mankind as your detestable traffic in slaves cannot you be content with a lawful and fair trade in golddust ivory gums wax etc etc which the african coast will afford in abundance but you must traffic in the bodies of the poor wretched inhabitants to support your luxuries like those who gave a boy for a harlot and a girl for wine are you a jot more righteous who barter men women and children by hundreds together for sugar and rum is this your recompense to god for all his mercies repent in time lest god should return your recompense upon your own heads for he has declared in this same text   if ye recompense me that is in such an unmerciful manner swistly and speedily will i return your recompense upon your own head etc and in the next verse but one the prophet marks the slavetrade of tire and zidon as one of the principal causes of his vengeance  the children also of judah and the children of jerusalem have ye sold unto the grecians that ye might remove them far from their border but how much farther do the english remove the poor africans from their border behold i will raise them out of the place wither ye have sold them and will return your recompense upon your own head observe how clearly the law of retribution is here laid down and i will sell your sons and your daughters into the hands of the children of judah and they shall sell them this is not to be considered as a permission to the jews to deal in slaves but only as a prophecy of gods retaliation upon tire and zidon which grotius says was fulfilled when gaza sidon and tire were afterward taken by alexander nempe cum gaza sidon et tyrus captae ab alexandro crit sac tom   p     z for the jews were undoubtedly guilty of sin when they fulfilled the prophecy and probably added thereby to their succeeding national affictions under antiochus and other succeeding tyrants for the same may be said of the jews in this case that the learned ferrerius observed on the case of the assyrians who were preordained by god to punish the israelitos and many other neighboring nations for their oppressions and other wickedness for though the assyrians executed gods wrath expressly by gods permission or even as it were by the divine command in prophecy yet the assyrians themselves as also the jews after them did not consider their actions in any such light for the only motives they were sensible of were the dictates of their own wicked hearts and the love of unlawful gain ferrerius in speaking of isaiahs prophecy concerning the assyrians chap x    remarks  versus    says he dixerat quod assyrius percussurus sit israelitas sicutaegyptius hic viz in the   th verse autem quod dominus parcussurus sit assyrios sicut aegyptum justum cnim est ut inquit paulus quod reddat dominus vicem impiis qui filios dei divexant sive aegyptii sive assyrii sint etiamsi mitente vel etiam jubente domino illud faciant nam et quod iniquo animo id faciant et propter alia quoque scelera ira dei digni sunt etc crit sac tom   p    0 see also note in page     concerning nebuchadnezzar quoted from abp sharp   to the sabeans to a people far off an exact retaliation for the

prepare war wake up the mighty men let all the men of war draw near let them come up beat your plow shares into swords thus the blessings of the gospel of peace are manifestly reversed to these nations which trade in slaves and indeed it has long been a proverb with the poor africians that wherever the christian faith is spread there goes with it a sword and a gun and your pruning hooks continues the prophet into spears let the weak say i am strong here again is another mark of gods vengeavance against oppressive nations viz the infatuation of their councils assemble yourselves says the prophet and come all ye nations in the common translation it is rendered come all ye heathens but the original word  more properly signifies the nations than the heathens   and gather yourselves together round about thither cause thy mighty ones to come down o lord let the nations be wakened and come up to the valley of jehoshaphat i e the valley of jehovah the judge for there will i sit to judge all the nations round about put ye in the sickle for the harvest is ripe come get ye down for the press is full the fats overflow for their wickedness is great multitudes multitudes in the valley of decision etc after which the prophet denounces judgment against two of these oppressive nations expressly by name  egypt shall be a desolation and edom shall be a desolate wilderness and the principal reason of these judgments is also as expressly assigned for their violence and the egyptians  for their violence received from god a retribution in kind which is still more awfully expressed by the prophet isaiah  so shall the king of assyria lead away the egyptians prisoners and the ethiopians captives young and old naked and barefoot even with their buttocks uncovered to the shame of egypt isaiah xx    a lively description this of the extreme misery and contempt with which the poor wretched ethiopian captives even to this day are oppressed and vilified  but by whom  not now surely by their old enemies the assyrians for they long ago received a just recompense for their tyranny and uncharitableness and are wiped off from the face of the earth and may we not expect that the almighty will also visit the modern oppressors of the ethiopians whose barbarous and unfeeling behavior toward the poor naked ethiopian captives is equally notorious  may we not expect that the assyrians or men of nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it matt xii    for they were previously engaged in a just war against the egyptians and ethiopians they were proveked to revenge by real injuries  by the lawless incursions of those unhappy sons of of ham and therefore they may seen to have some excuse for their severities but the europeans and more notoriously the british nation are now guilty of the same horrid barbarity and uncharitableness toward the ethiopians without any provocation whatsoever except the most detestable lust for unlawful gain and power  let my deluded countrymen receive from me an undeniable token of the apporaching destruction and misery which must inevitably overtake them if they do not repent  the token alas is already upon them  let them compare our present national condition with the several alarming circumstances which preceded the horrible debasement of the egyptioans and ethiopians above mentioned even the best histories of those nations cannot furnish a more exact and lively description of those symptoms of approaching nations destruction than that which was declared by isaiah in the spirit of prophecy  i the lord or jehovah will set the egyptians against the egyptians and they shall fight every one against his brother and every one against his neighbor city against city and kingdom against kingdom and the spirit of egypty shall fail in the midst thereof and i will destroy the council thereof isaiah xix       against the children of judah because they have shed innocent blood in their land but judah shall dwell for ever and jerusalem from generation to generation for i will cleanse their blood that i have not cleansed for the lord dwells in zion joel iii  the purpose beforementioned that is purposed upon the whole earth  was manifested also in the judgments denounced against the edomites by the prophet obediah  thy mighty men o teman shall be dismayed to the end that every one of the mount of esau may be cut off by slaughter and then the prophet assigns the usual causes of such vengeance for thy violence against thy brother jacob shame shall cover thee and thou shall be cut off for ever in the day that thou stoodest on the other side in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces and foreigners entered into his gates and cast lots upon jerusalem even thou wast as one of them that is one that assisted to enslave them but thou should not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger viz in the day that their brethren the israelites were carried away captives into a strange land for it seems that even to be neuter or merely look on like idle spectators when the liberty of their brethren was at stake would have been criminal but the edomites added to this crime by rejoicing at the calamity and joining the triumphant tyrants neither should thou have rejoiced over the children of judah in the day of their destruction neither should thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress thou should not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity yea thou should not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of calamity neither should thou have stood in the crossway to cut off those of his that did escape neither should thou have delivered up or rather shut up  or confined as in slavery or foreign captivity which by the restoration promised to the captives in the  0th and   st verses seems to have been the case those of his that did remain in the day of distress for the day of the lord is near upon all the heathen that is all the nations and then follows the purpose of retribution that is purposed upon the whole earth as thou have done it shall be done unto thee thy reward shall return upon thine own head etc  the like purpose of retribution was denounced against several nations by the prophet amos and first against the syrians  thus says the lord for three transgressions of damascus and for four i will not turn away the punishment thereof nevertheless their unmerciful tyranny over the inhabitants of gilead is the only transgression mentioned  because said the prophet they have threshed gilead with threshing instruments of iron but i will send fire into the house of hazael the king of syria anointed by elijah which shall devour the palaces of benhadad i will break also the bar of damascus etc and then at last he denounces the ordinary punishment for tyrants and oppressors  and the people of syria shall go into captivity unto kir says the lord amos i   to   this prophecy was punctually fulfilled when ahaz king of judah hired tiglathpileser king of assyria to help him against the syrians for we read in the   kings xvi    that the king of assyria hearkened unto him viz ahaz for the king of assyria went up against damascus and took it and carried the people of it captive to kir and slew rezin rezin was that turbubulent and oppressive king of syria who in another prophecy is compared to a sinoaking firebrand isaiah vii   the same purpose of retribution was also declared by amos against the philistines  for three transgressions of gaza and for four i will not turn away the punishment thereof  and yet only one of the four transgressions is mentioned which we may therefore reasonably conclude to be the principal transgression viz  because says the text they carried away captive the whole captivity to diliver them up to edom grotius thinks that this transgression was committed when sennacherib invaded judaea and that many jews upon his first approach fled to the neighboring regions and that the philistines instead of protecting the poor fugitives who had done them no injury sold them to the edumaeans as if they had been taken in open war cum sennacheribus judaeam invasit multi ad primum ejus adventum in vieinas regiones se recepere ut apparuit esa xvi   philistini hos judaeos qui nihil ipfis nocuerant non ut supplices protexerunt sed quasi bello captos vendiderunt idumaeis crit sac tom   p      many other commentators besides grotius have supposed this transgression to have been committed during the troubles occasioned by sennacheribs expediton but it is not probable though indeed it is possible that this was the time to which the prophecy referred because if it really was the prophecy foretold the transgression itself as well as the punishment of it for we find that the prophecy was delivered in the days of uzziah whereas the event to which they refer did not happen till many years afterward in the reign of ahaz there are some instances indeed of gods vengeance being really denounced against particular crimes even before the crimes themselves were committed which i shall show when i come to speak of babylon but in the case before us there is no necessity for supposing any such anticipation it being much more probable that the offense referred to by the prophecy was previously committed by the inhabitants of gaza after the combined army of the philistines and arabians had by gods permission subdued and plundered the inhabitants of judea in the reign of jehoram as related in the  d chron xxi       etc to which it is referred in clarkes annotations the cruelty of delivering up the captives to edom at the time abovementioned would be much aggravated in the circumstances of these times for then the edomites were become inveterate enemies to the jews having lately revolted from judah and during that very reign had been beaten and many of them slain in a pitched battle with the jews which rendered them the more implacable and therefore the unnatural cruelty of delivering up the jewish captives to edom at such a time must necessarily be esteemed a most heinous offense in the sight of a merciful god   or rather as the word  more properly signifies to cause them to be shut up that is in bondage to edom in short it appears from thence that they carried on the slave trade with edom as our liverpool and bristol merchants and some at london but few in proportion to the size of the place do at present with america but they were allowed but a short space for the enjoyment of their unlawful gains the denunciations of vengeance follows closely upon the very mention of that unnatural oppression but i will send a fire said the almighty on the wall of gaza this prophecy was probably fulfilled in the reign of hezekiah for we read in the   kings xviii   that he smote the philistines even unto gaza and the borders thereof from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city but the philistines of ashdod etc if not gaza also began to feel the weight of gods vengeance much sooner even by the hands of the king in whose reign the prophecy was delivered  for as long as he viz uzziah sought the lord god made him to prosper and he went forth and warred against the philistines and brake down the wall of gath and the wall of jabneh and the wall of ashdod and built cities about ashdod and among the philistines and god helped him against the philistines and against the arabians that dwelt in gurbaal and the mehurims etc   chronicles xxvi       and ashdod was afterward taken by the troops of sargon king of assyria isaiah xx   under tartan one of his generals who is mentioned likewise in   kings xviii    so that this was probably when the assyrians went up against jerusalem in the reign of hezekiah a very severe vengeance against the philipstines was afterward executed by the chaldeans and long after that again by the macedonians under alexander    which shall devour the palaces thereof and i will cut off the inhabitants from ashdod and him that holds the scepter from ashkelon and i will turn mine hand against ekron and the remnant of the philistines shall perish says the lord god amos i        the prophet then proceeds with a denunciation of the like purpose of gods vengeance against the opulent city of tire and expressly for the same offense for the tyrians were probably confederates with the philistines of gaza and other cities of the phoenician coast when they assisted the arabians to oppress and enslave the inhabitants of judea  thus says the lord for three transgressions of tyrus and for four i will not turn away the punishment thereof now be pleased to remark that though the tyrians were notorious idolaters and very wicked in many other respects yet here again the oppression of enslaving their brethren even of a different nation was the only crime that god was pleased more particularly to impute and point out to them as being most heinous in his sight because said the prophet they delivered up the whole captivity to edom for tire was the philistine liverpool it seems which supplied edom with slaves and remembered not the brotherly covenant probably alluding to the league that was made between solomon and hiram king of tire mentioned in the first book of kings v    and there was peace between hiram and solomon and they two made a league together    but i will send a fire on the wall of tyrus which shall devour the palaces thereof amos i    0 by another cotemporary prophet isaiah a retribution in kind was denounced against tire  is this your joyous city whose antiquity was of ancient days her own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn  ire pedibus suis in captivitatem says clarius crit sac tom   p   0  that is just as the poor slaves are nowadays brought down on foot from the inland parts of africa to the slave markets on the coasts who has taken this council against tire the crowning city whose merchants are princes whose traffickers are the honorable of the earth the lord of hosts has purposed it plainly referring to the purpose which he had before declared in the xiv chap    to be purposed upon the whole earth  which i have shown to be for the most part a retribution in kind to strain or pollute the pride of all glory and to bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth isai xxiii         the like purpose of gods vengeance is next denounced against edom on account of her notorious violations also of brotherly love for the almighty father of mankind will not see his creature man oppressed and vilified without revenging the affront  thus says the lord for three transgressions of edom and for four i will not turn away the punishment thereof because he did pursue his brother with the sword and did cast off all pity as our modern american slaveholders cast off all pity toward their poor runaway slaves for i have seen rewards publicly offered for the heads of those poor oppressed people from the carolina gazette by robert wells dated  0 dec       a hundred pounds reward run away upwards of twelve months ago a negro man named salisbury a squat wellset fellow about five feet five inches high branded on the right breast  s n b branded like a beast he formerly belonged to richard beresford esquire and is supposed to be harbored about the plantation of mr john wigfall in st thomass parish where he has a brother i will give a reward of twenty pounds currency to whoever will apprehend the said negro and deliver him at the workhouse in charlestown or any of the gaols in this province or to me at my plantation in st bartholomews parish i will give the same reward for his head n b the subscriber is absolutely guilty of felony for offering a price for blood and a further reward of one hundred pounds currency for the discovery of his being harbored by a white person and fifty pounds currency if by a negro though it is a moral law of the old testament a command even from god himself not to deliver up to his master the servant that is escaped from his master deuteronomy xxiii    to be paid on conviction of the offender or offenders  october        signed thomas smith    and the shooting of runaway negroes has even been encouraged by some of the plantation laws which is wilful premeditated murder such as god will never leave unpunished and his anger did tear perpetually and he kept his wrath for ever but i said jehovah will send a fire upon teman the carolina of those times which shall devour the palaces of bozrah amos chap i ii     the prophet in the next verse denounces gods vengeance against the bloodyminded ammonites for their horrid barbarity in murdering the wives and children of their enemies murder being a crime still more heinous in the sight of god than slavery because the robbing a man of his life is a higher act of oppression and unnatural violence than bondage it being indeed the last degree of oppression that a tyrant has in his power  thus says the lord for three transgressions of the children of ammon and for four will i not turn away the punishment thereof because they have ripped up the women with child of gilead this example shows that god will severely avenge himself of all such abandoned soldiers as those who kill women and children for we may be assured that no pretended rules of war can justify such detestable outrages in his sight unless they can produce an express commission from the almighty for that purpose like that which was given to the israelites against the wicked canaanites etc   that they might enlarge their border probably the ammonites like some of our settlers and planters at st vincents coveted  that fine cream part of the country  about gilead then in the possession of their neighbors and might perhaps stir up their public financiers to settle an arrangement for the disposal of the said lands without the knowledge and consent of the ancient and lawful possessors as if the supposed political necessity to enlarge their border could justify robbery and murder by authority of government  against similar crimes in israel the prophet thus denounced gods vengeance woe to them that devise iniquity and work evil upon their beds when the morning is light they practice it because it is in the power of their hand and they covet fields and take them by viclence and houses and take them away so they oppress a man and his house even a man and his heritage therefore thus says the lord jehovah  behold against this family apparently meaning the family or stock of that whole nation do i devise an evil from which ye shall not remove your necks neither shall ye go haughtily for this time is evil mic ii   to   for your hands are defiled with blood and your fingers with iniquity  none calls for justice nor any pleads for truth they trust in vanity and speak lies they conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity etc  and the act of violence is in their hands their feet run to evil and they make haste to shed innocent blood their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity wasting and destruction or breaking are in their paths the way of peace they know not and there is no judgment  i e right or justice in their goings they have made them crooked paths whosoever goes therein shall not know peace therefore is judgment i e right or equity far from us neither does justice  properly righteousness overtake us etc   according to their deeds or more properly according to recompenses i e gods eternal laws of retribution accordingly he i e jehovah will repay fury to his adversaries recompense to his enemies to the islands he will repay recompense isaiah lix to the   th verse    but i will kindle a fire in the wall of rabbah and it shall devour the palaces thereof with shouting in the day of battle with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind and their king shall go into captivity mark the proper punishment of tyrants he and his princes together says the lord amos i         next in order the prophet declares gods purpose of vengeance against moab see the following chapter  thus says the lord for three transgressions of moab and for four i will not turn away the punishment thereof because he burned the bones of the king of edom into lime the chaldee interpreter adds  and plastered them like chalk or lime in the house this seems to have been done in extreme contempt to vilify the edomites and does not agree with the account of the particular human sacrifice made by the king of moab upon the wall mentioned in   kings iii    to which the margin of our english bibles commonly refers us for that seems to have been a sacrifice by the king of moab of his own son suum viz filium inquam says grotius non idumaeae praefecti ut quidam colligunt ex amoso ii   ubi alia respicitur historia crit sac tom   p         rather than a burning of the bones of the king of edom we may however learn from this example that god is offended with any contemptuous vilifying of the human body even when dead and how much more then will he be offended with those who vilify their living brethren by contemptously holding them in a despicable bondage  but i will send a fire upon moab moab was condemned also by another prophet isaiah for her want of charity to the poor fugitives of israel and judah in a time that god had delivered them into the hands of their enemies  hide the outcasts said isaiah in his denunciation of judgment against moab bewray not him that wandereth let mine outcasts dwell with thee moab be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler for the extortioner is at an end the spoiler cease the oppressors are consumed out of the land isaiah xvi      and it shall devour the palaces of kirioth and moab shall die with tumult with shouting and with the sound of the trumpet and i will cut off the judge from the midst thereof and will slay all the princes thereof with him says the lord amos ii       to these judgments of the several nations the prophet now adds the condemnation of judah left the jews should imagine that gods vengeance was only to be denounced against the heathen nations  thus says the lord for three transgressions of judah and for four i will not turn away the punishment thereof because they have despised the law of the lord now the apostle paul informs us that all the law is fulfilled in one word even in this thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself galat v    and consequently the oppression of the poor of which the jews were notoriously guilty as i have shown was next to idolatry one of the most heinous transgressions of the law which principally drew down gods vengeance upon them though it is not particularly mentioned in this place  and have not kept his commandments and their lies caused them to err after the which their fathers have walked but i will send a fire upon judah and it shall devour the palaces of jerusalem amos ii      and last of all is declared the purpose of retribution and vengeance that was purposed upon the people of israel to whom the prophet amos was more particularly sent to warn them of their approaching captivity on account of their notorious oppressions and for the slave trade in particular  thus says the lord for three transgressions of israel and for four i will not turn away the punishment thereof because they sold the righteous for silver and the poor for a pair of shoes amos ii   and in the next chapter the prophet is directed to call upon their old enemies the philistines and egyptians to bear witness to the cause of gods vengeance on his own people publish in the palaces of ashdod and in the palaces of the land of egypt and say assemble yourselves upon the mountains of samaria and behold the great tumults in the midst thereof and the oppressed in the midst thereof for they know not to do right the prophet amos charges them still further with their shameful perversion of justice and natural right in the   th chapter and  th verse  ye who turn judgment to wormwood and leave off righteousness in the earth and a little afterward he charges them with notorious corruption  for i know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins they afflict the just they take a bribe and they turn aside the poor in the gate  from their right therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time for it is an evil time he then warns them to make use of that natural knowledge of good and evil which all mankind inherit from our first parents  seek good and not evil says the prophet that ye may live and so the lord the god of hosts shall be with you as ye have spoken hate the evil and love the good and establish judgment in the gate it may that the lord god of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of joseph  thus the israelites might have saved themselves from gods vengeance by a timely repentance but they were too corrupt and wicked it seems to take warning for the judgment is immediately after denounced on account of the said national corruption and injustice  therefore the lord the god of hosts the lord says thus wailing shall be in all thy streets and they shall say in all the highways alas alas and they shall call the husbandman to mourning and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing and in all vineyards shall be wailing for i will pass through thee says the lord  now let the inhabitants of great britain examine themselves and enquire whether there are not corruptions and injustice among them also which may be equally liable to draw down gods vengeance whether their representatives in the great national assembly or congregation of the people do not annually encourage and promote the african slave trade which includes infinitely more oppression and injustice than the israelites were ever guilty of and whether the poor miners colliers and saliers of scotland who lately applied to them for relief from the monstrous oppression and injustice of the unreasonable landholders an oppression at least equal to if not far exceeding the israelitish bondage of the poor have yet received redress for the injuries done them or whether on the contrary the injustice which never had any other foundation but that of unjust force and usurpation is not now confirmed for a certain number of years longer by act of parliament but o my countrymen let us call to mind before it is too late the dreadful consequences of turning judgment into wormwood and of leaving off righteousness in the earth let us remember the heavy judgments that are denounced against the oppressions of the poor and that there is one who will surely avenge their cause  the lord jehovah is his name that strengthens the spoiled against the strong so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress they hate him that rebukes in the gate and they abhor him that speaks uprightly forasmuch therefore continues the prophet as your treading is upon the poor and ye take from him burdens of wheat ye have built houses of hewn stone but ye shall not dwell in them ye have planted pleasant vineyards but ye shall not drink wine of them for i know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins they afflict the just they take a bribe and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right etc amos v   to      says the lord who store up violence and robbery in their palaces therefore thus says the lord god and adversary there shall be even round about the land and he shall bring down they strength from thee and thy palaces shall be spoiled etc amos iii    0     thus it appears that god was not less severe against his own peculiar people when guilty of oppression and injustice than he was against the neighboring nations for the like offenses and i hope the many examples which i have given of gods vengeance against these crimes and more especially against the crime of enslaving and vilifying mankind will awaken the attention of my countrymen in general that they may seriously consider whether we have not just reason to fear the effects of gods vengeance also upon great britain and her colonies for similar offenses  long before the present unhappy civil war broke out between the mother country and her colonies i thought it my duty to give fair warning to his majestys ministers extract of a letter from the author to lord  dated the   th of february       his majesty has been pleased lately to recommend to parliament the providing new laws for supplying defects or remedying abuses in such instances where it shall be requisite and i apprehend my lord that there is no instance whatever which requires more immediate redress than the present miserable and deplorable slavery of negroes and indians as well as of white english servants in our colonies i say immediate redress because to be in power and to neglect as life is very uncertain even a day in endeavoring to put a stop to such monstrous injustice and abandoned wickedness must necessarily endanger a mans eternal welfare be he ever so great in temporal dignity or office etc   that some heavy vengeance must inevitably overtake us according to the usual course of gods providence if the iniquitous slave trade and the toleration of involuntary bondage were continued and that such monstrous oppression and national wickedness extract of a letter from the author to lord  dated the  th of december        if the seasonable warning against the crying national wickedness of promoting the african slave trade and tolerating slavery in america which i seht about three years ago in a private letter to lord  had been duly regarded i sincerely believe that the present misunderstanding etc and the alarming consequences which now threaten us would not have happened  great britain and her colonies seem to be preparing themselves for mutual for all the law is fulfilled in one word even in this thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself but if we bite and devour one another take heed that ye be not consumed one of another gal v       see my tract on the law of liberty or royal law   destruction which alas is too apparently merited on both sides for such monstrous oppression and national wickedness cannot escape a national punishment according to the usual course of gods providence in the world unless a hearty repentance and amendment should avert the impending vengeance etc   cannot escape a national punishment according to the usual course of gods providence in the world unless a hearty repentance and amendment should avert the impending vengeance  this doctrine is unquestionably demonstrated i trust by the several extracts from the holy scriptures which i have inserted in the preceding pages and the proof of it i thank god affords me a double recompense for my labors in collecting them for it not only vindicates my previous assertions to the ministers of his present majesty but it confirms the similar assertions of my own grandfather declared near a century ago to the great national assembly of this kingdom  wicked men said he may be happy and prosperous here and good men may suffer many afflictions and tribulations without any the least reflection on the justice or goodness of the great governor of the world because there is a farther day reserved for the adjusting all mens rewards according to their works but now the consideration of public societies and nations is quite different nations are not made to be immortal but end with the world no society as a society shall be called to a future account but all the rewards and punishments they are capable of as societies must be adjudged and distributed to them in this present life and therefore if we suppose god to be the judge and governor of the world and of all the nations in it as well as he is the judge and governor of particular persons we must likewise suppose that he administers all affairs so that righteous and religious nations have in this world the reward of their virtue in the blessings of peace and plenty and all manner of temporal prosperity and on the other side impious and incorrigible nations are likewise punished in this world for their wickedness either by severe judgments or by a total destruction as god in his infinite wisdom sees cause  the word of god does all along bear testimony to the truth of this  there is no judgment threatened to any nation in the holy scripture and abundance of nations are there threatened but it is upon the account of the sins and wickedness they were guilty of which sins if they repented of so repented as to forsake them they might find mercy and accordingly we find in fact that god always dealt with people and nations according to these measures etc  and after citing the examples of the ninevites canaanites and babylonians and after referring us to the greek roman and even to the turkish history for more examples he remarks concerning the jews in particular that  every degree of public vice and departure from gods laws was always punished with public judgment and on the other side every degree of public repentance and reformation was always rewarded with public happiness and prosperity so that any one that could make a right estimate of that nation and how it stood as to virtue and vice might constantly make a judgment likewise how it would fare with them as to their outward temporal affairs i must confess says he that generally speaking there is little force in those arguments that are drawn from examples but in the case i am now upon i think there is great weight in them for though we can not angue from gods dealing with one person that he will just deal in the same manner with another yet as to nations and kingdoms the case is otherwise as i before said for gods dispensations and providence to them seem all to proceed upon one immutable foundation  which will be the same in all ages and countries namely the expression and vindication of his justice and goodness in this world archb sharps sermons vol   sermon   entitled virtue and religion the only means to make a nation prosperous the whole sermon is indeed a complete and unanswerable argument against those sophists who contend for the necessity of political evil and of permitting and encouraging vice in certain degrees as they shall think fit for state occasions     can we claim a better right to the enslaved negroes in the british colonies than the several ancient nations abovementioned had to their captive enemies whom god had delivered into their hands and yet we find they were made mutual instruments of destruction to each other on that very account  israel i mean the kingdom of the ten tribes was the scourge of judah judah of israel syria was the scourge of both as also were edom moab and ammon and assyria was the scourge of them all egypt again was the scourge of assyria and assyria under a babylonish king became afterward the severe scourge and retaliator of evils upon egypt  the opulent tire with her princely merchants suffered among the rest for her iniquitous traffic in slaves these enterprising traders the first great navigators of the world says the sensible and benevolent author of britannia libera having in the course of their success and their grandeur imported for their own use a great number of slaves they conspired slew their masters and all the freemen two only excepted old strato and his son who were saved through the generosity of their own slave took to themselves their wives and daughters with the whole city and raised a new commonwealth a dreadful example says justin to all the world celebre hoc servorum facinus metuendumque exemplum toto orb terrarum fuit just hist lib xviii   who nevertheless went on in their former course of enslaving one another britannia libera or a defense of the free state of man in england against the claim of any man there as a slave p      and the lesser philistine states ashdod gath gaza etc did not partake of the uncharitable crime without an equal share of retribution  these examples clearly demonstrate the necessity of observing the apostles advice  if ye bite and devour one another take heed that ye are not consumed one of another gal v    which is a striking representation of the extreme danger of oppression and the want of brotherly lover for surely no oppression can be more notorious and biting than that of enslaving others nor can the danger of being consumed one of another according to the apostles express words be more apparent than in the frequent insurrections which have ever been the unavoidable consequences of slavery see an extract from mr morgans book entitled a plan for the abolition of slavery etc printed at the end of this tract   can we reasonably expect that the only exception to gods general rule of national vengeance and retribution upon the authors of slavery and oppression shall be in favor of great britain which has so notoriously exceeded all other nations in the multiplicity and largeness of her dealings in the mantrade long before this additional load of national guilt had arrived at any considerable height the nation was supposed to be under a very dangerous burden of sin which my grandfather testified before the house of commons we are not that innocent virtuous pious people said he that may certainly reckon upon gods favor and think ourselves in all cases sure of his protection for if the doctrine i have now been insisting on to you be true doctrine then we of this nation can but entertain very small hopes of being happy and prosperous nay we cannot but apprchend misery and ruin and desolation to ourselves unless god be abundantly more merciful to us than we deserve and there can be no way to prevail with him to be so but an universal humiliation and repentance and this is the application i desire to make of the point i have been now treating of  with the same view and desire exactly is the present address laid before the public though the author was not aware when the tract was sent to the press that his ancestor had borne such ample public testimony to the truth of the same doctrine concerning the law of national retribution as he has since cited from his works  if the measure of gods dealing with nations be always according to the moral state of them if their good fortunes be dealt out to them according to their virtues and judgments be inflicted upon them according to their provoking god by their sins as we have said good lord what a lamentable prospect have we of this kingdom of what may come upon us and what infinite reason have we thereupon immediately to try all the ways that are possible of making our peace with god that so iniquity may not be our ruin archbp sharps sermons vol   sermon   p          th edit but the horrible abomination of the slave trade was only in its infancy when my grandfather made this declaration and the baneful tendency of it perhaps was hardly known to him or he would certainly have entered a zealous and particular protest against it with such an accumulated load of national guilt the necessity of a public humiliation and repentance is become more and more obvious especially as the long foreseen vengeance of the almighty seems now ready to burst upon our heads let us therefore earnestly join in the necessary reformation that so iniquity may not be our ruin    that iniquitous and oppressive business of purchasing our poor unhappy african brothers and sisters  men women and children and then forcibly transporting them far from their border even to the opposite side almost of this terrestrial globe  what is this my countrymen but a notorious aggravation of that very crime for which the vengeance and retribution of the almighty was poured on the heads of the ancient tyrian merchants abovementioned they sold the captive jews to the grecians a neighboring people but ye have sold the poor africans who never offended you to the very distant inhabitants of america and the west indies that ye might remove them far far indeed from their border have we not reason to expect the same awful decree of the divine justice which immediately follows these words  behold i will raise them i e the slaves out of the place whither ye have sold them and will return your recompense upon your own head and i will sell your sons and your daughters etc joel iii     have we not ample reason to fear that god will make of this nation in proportion to the magnitude of our guilt in slavedealing a tremendous example of retribution to deter other nations from offending his eternal justice if a sincere and speedy national repentance does not avert the evil  the lord jehovah is his name that strengthened the spoiled against the strong so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress amos v     that says  they shall spoil those that spoiled them ezekiel xxxix  0 this latter sentence of retribution as well as the first was denounced indeed against the oppressors of the israelites but yet the justice of it is equally applicable to the unprovoked oppressors of the poor africans  we know not how soon a just national retribution may overtake us how soon the almighty may think fit to recompense the british nation according to the work of their own hands or how soon he may withdraw his light from us and leave us involved in the same deplorable ignorance that the africans themselves unhappily fell into very soon after they perverted the truth and intention of the gospel which was once planted and that very early even in the internal parts of their vast continent as i have elsewhere shown see my tract on the just limitation of slavery pages    to    this lamentable fall of africa that africa said he which is not now more fruitful of monsters than it was once of excellently wise and learned men that africa which formerly afforded us our clemens our origin our tertullian our cyprian our augustine and many other extraordinary lights in the church of god that famous africa in whose soil christianity did thrive so prodigiously and could boast of so many flourishing churches alas isnow a wilderness the wild boars have broken into the vineyard and eaten it up and it brings forth nothing but briars and thorns to use the words of the prophet and who knows but god may suddenly make this church and nation this our england which jeshurun like is waxed fat and grown proud and has kicked against god such another example of the vengeance of this kind archbp sharps sermons vol   sermon   entitled repentance the means for averting gods judgment  th edit p    preached before the house of commons april           was the very example by which my own grandfather near a century ago wanting only three years warned the house of commons concerning our national danger  but there is still one more great example against tyranny and oppression which must not be omitted i mean the example of gods vengeance against babylon that great and terrible scourge of all the other ancient nations already mentioned in this tract for as her oppressions were more general and extensive so her punishment is more frequently and more fully declared in scripture  the prophet jeremiah denounced the law of retribution against the babylonians in the strongest terms as well in return for the cruel slaughters they were guilty of as for the heavy yoke of bondage with which they oppressed the captive israelites see chap l  declare ye among the nations said the prophet and publish and set up a standard publish and conceal not say babylon is taken bell is confounded etc for out of the north there comes up a nation against her which shall make her land desolate manifestly in return for the cruel desolation of judea and none shall dwell therein that is in babylon they shall remove they shall depart both man and beast jer l     and to mark the indignation as well as the cause of it in the strongest terms by the severity of contrast the promise of a happy restoration to the captives whom they oppressed is blended with the sentence of their own condemnation  in those days and at that time says the lord the children of israel shall come they and the children of judah together going and weeping they shall go and seek the lord their god they shall ask the way to zion with their faces thitherward saying come and let us join ourselves to the lord in a perpetual covenant that shall not be forgotten my people have been lost sheep their shepherds that is their wicked kings see jer xxiii have caused them to go astray etc all that found them have devoured them and their adversaries said we offend not because they have sinned against the lord in like manner an advocate for the african trade who distinguished himself by the signature of mercator hoped to remove the odium of oppressing the poor africans by falsely asserting that they were descended from canaan who was cursed by his father noah  cursed be canaan a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren treatise upon the trade from great britain to africa by an african merchant appendix   see also my tract on the just limitation of slavery etc p        wherein this assertion of mercator is answered    the habitation of justice even the lord the hope of their fathers the prophet then immediately refumes the burden of babylon  remove out of the midst of babylon etc  shout against her round about she has given her hand her foundations are fallen her walls are thrown down for it is the vengeance of the lord take vengeance upon her as she has done do unto her jer l       here the law of retribution is strongly marked and again in the   th verse  israel is a scattered sheep the lions have driven him away first the king of assyria has devoured him and last this nebuchadrezzar king of babylon has broken his bones therefore thus says the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will punish the king of babylon and his land as i have punished the king of assyria see the example before quoted and i will bring israel again to his habitation etc  call together the archers against babylon all ye that bend the bow camp against it round about let none thereof escape recompense her according to her work according to all that she has done do unto her for she has been proud against the lord against the holy one of israel therefore shall her young men fall in the streets etc and a little further the principal cause of gods anger is more particularly expressed  thus says the lord of hosts the children of israel and the children of judah were oppressed together and all that took them captives held them fast they refused to let them go but mark ye slaveholders what immediately follows  their redeemer is strong the lord of hosts jehovah of armies is his name he shall thoroughly plead their cause that he may give rest to the land and disquiet the inhabitants of babylon  a sword is upon the chaldeans etc see the whole  0th chapter  the law of retribution is also strongly marked in the  0th chapter where the prophet promises that jehovah will bring again the captivity of his people israel and judah ver   and that jacob shall be saved out of his trouble ver   and more especially from slavery declaring as the word of the lord of hosts i will break his yoke from off thy neck and will burst thy bonds and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him but they shall serve the lord their god compare this with levit xxv    for they are my servants said the almighty which i brought out of the land of egypt they shall not be sold as bondmen    and david their king whom i will raise up unto them this is allowed even by the jews to be a prophecy of the messiah for in the targum of jonathan it is rendered  and obedient meschiae filie david regi suo the messiah is reprented under the name of david signifying a friend in three other places  twice in ezekiel and once in hosea  being the true friend of mankind whose principal doctrine was universal love and good will toward men and christ himself after explaining the necessary doctrine of love john xv   to    condescended to honor his followers with the reciprocal appellation of friends   ye are my friends said he if ye do whatsoever i command you henceforth i call you not servants for the servant knows not what his lord does but i have called you friends for all things that i have heard of my father i have made know unto you etc here is a clear enfranchisement of christs household whereby we learn that true christian liberty is acquired by the knowledge of gods will revealed to us by christ if we sincerely ask the assistance of the holy spirit that we may act accordingly then shall we be friends indeed    see verses   and   and he represents god as speaking to the whole nation under the personal figure of their ancestor the patriarch jacob saying i am with thee says the lord to save thee though i make a full end of all nations whither i have scattered thee yet will i not make a full end of thee showing that israel was still the peculiar people of god but i will correct thee in measure and will not leave thee altogether unpunished ver    and also after some further expostulation concerning the grievous affliction of that peculiar people and the cause of it the prophet proceeds in the   th verse to declare the divine judgment of a severe retribution against the enemies of jacob  therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured and all thine adversaries every one of them shall go into captivity and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil and all that prey upon thee will i give for a prey for i will restore health unto thee and i will heal thee of thy wounds says the lord because they called thee an outcast as it was manifestly an offense in the sight of god to call israel an outcast during the former desolation it certanily is not less so now though that devoted people is at present dispersed over the face of all the earth without a single acre of national territory in any one place for the scriptures gives us ample assurance of a much more glorious return of the jews than that from babylon and the apostle to the gentiles has expressly declared that god has not cast away his people which he fore knew romans xi   and in the   th verse he says through their fall salvation is come unto the gentiles for to provoke them to jealousy now says he if the fall of them be the riches of the world and the diminishing of them the riches of the gentiles how much more their fullness etc and again in the   th verse  if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world what shall the receiving of them be but life from the dead and the apostle also warns us not to boast against the branches of that mystical olive tree on which the wild olive tree of the gentiles is grafted for says he if god spared not the natural branches the israelites take heed lest he also spare not thee  and indeed we have the greatest reason to acknowledge the great mercy of god in sparing this nation hitherto if we consider the many bloody persecutions of the jews in this kingdom during the dark days of popish ignorance many particulars of which may be seen in toveys anglia judaica or perhaps we may say that many of the bloody civil wars and other national calamities that have already distressed this nation may have been inflicted on our ancestors for their unmerciful treatment of these wandering strangers in persecuting banishing and even murdering them in multitudes for the sake of plundering and robbing them of their wealth let us remember the confident hope of the apostle that the israelites shall be again grafted into their own olive tree  for says he god is able to graff them in again for if thou were cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature and were graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree how much more shall these which be the natural branches be graffed into their own olive tree and he adds for i would not brethren that ye should be ignorant of this mystery lest ye should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part is happened to israel until the fullness of the gentiles be come in and so shall all israel be saved as it is written  there shall come out of sion the deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness from jacob for this is my covenant with them when i shall take away their sins etc see the whole chapter    saying this is zion whom no man seeks after etc  in the   th chapter also a severe retribution is denounced expressly against the king of babylon and the land of the chaldeans to confirm all that had been foretold by jeremiah  i will make it viz babylon or the land of the chaldeans perpetual desolations and i will bring upon that land all my words which i have pronounced against it even all that is written in this book which jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations for many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them also that is by reducing them also to slavery and bondage and i will recompense them now mark gods law of retribution according to their deeds and according to the works of their own hands jer xxv         and even the prophet isaiah who lived long before jeremiah also denounced a retribution in kind against babylon in as plain and intelligible a style as if he had been relating the history of things past though the time of delivering the prophecy was long before the captivity of judah and consequently long before even the offense was committed for which the retribution was denounced see chap    for the lord said isaiah will have mercy on jacob and will yet choose israel and set them in their own land this observe was foretold long before they were removed from it and the strangers shall be joined with them this was the case particularly of the edomites after the return from the babylonish captivity and they shall cleave to the house of jacob etc  and they shall take them captives whose captives they were and they shall rule over their oppressors this is a manifest retribution in kind and it shall come to pass in the day that the lord shall give thee israel rest from thy sorrow and from thy fear and from the hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve that thou shall take up this proverb against the king of babylon and say how has the oppressor ceased the lord has broken the staff of the wicked and the scepter of the rulers he who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke he that ruled the nations in anger is persecuted and none hinders etc isaiah xiv       they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider thee saying is this the man that made the earth to tremble that did shake kingdoms that made the world as a wilderness and destroyed the cities thereof that opened not the house of his prisoners etc ver       mark this ye hardened slaveholders who are so tenacious of that usurped and pretended property which ye claim in the persons of your fellow men will ye also refuse to open the house of your prisoners remember that the same god still reigns and never changes if he spared not the first and most glorious monarchy upon earth he surely will not spare you unless ye sincerely repent and reform gods vengeance against babylon was executed expressly on account of the heavy yoke of bondage with which they oppressed their captives the judgment and the denunciation of it was the more exemplary as it was a judgment in kind  a manifest retribution of slavery the language is awful and majestic as well as truly poetical for the condemned nation is figuratively represented under the similitude of a delicate young woman or virgin whereby the national judgment is rendered as it were personal and consequently much more striking and affecting than it could have been in any other way come down said the prophet isaiah chap xlvii and sit in the dust o virgin daughter of babylon sit on the ground that is to denote her future abject state when deprived of royalty there is no throne o daughter of the chaldeans for thou shall no more be called tender and delicate the prophet then proceeds to describe the deplorable state of the most abject slaves which was now to be transferred from the sufferers to the slaveholders themselves he still addresses himself to the imperial city under the simile of a woman and gives that lady of kingdoms see ver    sit thou silent and get thee into darkness o daughter of the chaldeans for thou shall no more be called the lady of kingdoms   a humiliating information of her future employment and condition in slavery  take the millstones and grind meal uncover thy locks make bare the leg uncover the thigh pass over the rivers thy nakedness shall be uncovered yea thy shame shall be seen i will take vengeance i will not meet thee as a man etc the prophet after giving assurance to israel that jehovah the holy one of israel would be their redeemer that is a redeemer from slavery both temporal and spiritual proceeds to declare the reason of gods severe vengeance against babylon in the  th verse  i was wroth with my people i have polluted mine inheritance and given them into thine hand thou did show them no mercy upon the ancient have thou very heavily laid thy yoke and thou said i shall be a lady for ever so that thou did not lay these things to thy heart neither did remember the latter end of it therefore hear now this thou that art given to pleasures that dwell carelessly etc  these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day the loss of children and widowhood they shall come upon thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries and for the great abundance of thine enchantments for thou have trusted in thy wickedness thou have said none sees me thy wisdom and thy knowledge it has perverted thee mark this ye little philosophers and sophistical deists who even make it a question whether there be such a thing as providence in the world and thou have said in thine heart i am and none else beside me therefore shall evil come upon thee thou shall not know from whence it rises and mischief shall fall upon thee thou shall not be able to put it off and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly compare this with the aboverecited passage in the  th verse  these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day etc the same sudden and unexpected vengeance is also strongly described by jeremiah  babylon said he in the spirit of prophecy is suddenly fallen and destroyed howl for her etc chap li   this exemplary vengeance was denounced expressly on account of the babylonian tyranny over the jewish captives for in a preceding verse the latter are comforted and informed of the retribution determined against babylon  for israel has not been forsaken said the prophet nor judah of his god of the lord of hosts though their land was filled with sin against the holy one of israel flee out of the midst of babylon and deliver every man his soul be not cut off in her iniquity for this is the time of the lords vengeance he will render unto her a recompense also in the   th verse of the same chapter the retribution is clearly declared  i will render unto babylon and to all the inhabitants of chaldea all their evil that they have done in zion in your sight says the lord etc and in the   th verse also  as babylon has caused the slain of israel to fall so at babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth etc    which thou shall not know stand now with thine enchantments and with the multitude of thy sorceries wherein thou have labored from thy youth if so be thou shall be able to profit if so be thou may prevail thou art wearied with the multitude of thy councils let now the astrologers the stargazers for babylon was famous for her very ancient royal observatory the monthly prognosticators stand up and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee behold they shall be as stubble the fire shall burn them they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame etc isaiah xlvii        the babylonians were worshippers of fire so that the abovementioned denunciation of fiery vengeance seems to be peculiarly applicable and it is remarkable that the king of babylon had recourse to his astrologers the king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers the chaldeans and the soothsayers etc viz to interpret the handwriting on the wall mentioned in the book of daniel chap v but they were ignorant of their approaching destruction   agreeable to this prophecy in the dreadful night when the medes and persians were to enter his capital city for these nations were expressly called upon by name as the appointed instruments of gods vengeance  make bright the arrows for the medes and persians were famous archers gather the shields the lord has raised up the spirit of the kings of the medes for his device is against babylon to destroy it because it is the vengeance of the lord the vengeance of his temple jer li    and in the   th verse the prophet expressly names the kingdoms from whence the several armies that came with the medes and persians were raised  set ye up a standard in the land blow the trumpet among the nations prepare the nations against her call together against her the kingdoms of ararat  viz in the neighborhood of armenia minni or aramminni the armenians themselves  and ashkenaz  viz the nations descended from the eldest son of gomer who were nearly allied in blood to the medes madai their ancestor being a brother of gomer as also of magog from whom the turks have since descended and all of them from the same neighborhood appoint a captain against her who is afterward declared to be cyrus cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillars the persians as also the parthians and after them the turks likewise were ever famous for their cavalry prepare against her the nations with the kings of the medes the captains thereof and all the rulers thereof and all the land of his dominion etc and in ver    he says for the spoilers shall come unto her from the north the prophet isaiah also distinctly pointed out the same instruments of gods vengeance against babylon  lift ye up the banner upon the high mountain exalt the voice unto them etc describing the first mustering of the confederate nations against the overgrown tyrannical power of babylon  the noise of a multitude in the mountains probably meaning the mountains of ararat etc mentioned by jeremiah like as of a great people a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together the lord of hosts  viz jehovah of armies mustereth the host of the battle here we see the proper meaning of the lord of hosts they come from a far country from the end of heaven even the lord and the weapons of his indignation to destroy the whole land etc behold i will stir up the medes against them which shall not regard silver and as for gold they shall not delight in it their bows also for the medes were eminent archers shall dash the young men to pieces and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb their eye shall not spare the children and babylon the glory of kingdoms the beauty of the chaldees excellency shall be as when god overthrew sodom and gomorrah etc chap xiii       again in   st chapter the same prophet distinctly names the medes and persians to be the instruments of gods retribution against babylon a grievous vision is declared unto me the treacherous dealer deals treacherously and the spoiler spoileth go up o elam for the persians were descended from the patriarch elam the son of shem mentioned in genesis x    as josephus observes in his antiq lib i c    besiege o media all the sighing thereof have i made to cease therefore are my loins filled with pain the prophet seems to describe the consternation of the king of babylon just before his destruction pangs have taken hold upon me as the pangs of a woman that travaileth i was bowed down at the hearing of it viz of daniels interpretation of the handwriting upon the wall of the banqueting house  i was dismayed at the seeing of it probably meaning the miraculous appearance of the hand which wrote my heart panted fearfulness affrighted me isaiah xxi      the extreme fear which really possessed the king of babylon in that dreadful time of retribution is strongly described by daniel who was an eyewitness of it chap v   viz that the joints of his loins were loosed and his knees smote one against another  the medes and persians and their associates are also described by jeremiah as well as the extreme fear and anguish of the king of babylon on hearing the report of them  behold said the prophet a people shall come from the north armenia media etc being to the north of mesopotamia or babylonia and a great nation and many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth they shall hold the bow and the lance they are cruel and will not show mercy their voice shall roar like the sea and they shall ride upon horses see the remark above concerning the pensian cavalry the persians having obtained that very name on account of their character as horsemen for perse or pheresh signifies a horseman as well as parth or phereth every one put in array like a man to the battle against thee o daughter of babylon the king of babylon has heard the report of them and his hands waxed feeble anguish took hold of him and pangs as of a woman in travail etc chap l           and the horrors of that fatal night were plainly foretold  the night of my pleasure says the prophet manifestly referring to the impious midnight carousal mentioned by daniel by herodotus and xenophon has he turned into fear unto me the excess of which is described in the former verses quoted in the preceding note prepare the table watch in the watchtower for the babylonians trusted in their walls and towers as appears also by jeremiahs prophecy on the same occasion set up the standard upon the walls of babylon  make the watch strong set up the watchmen prepare the ambushes etc jer li       eat drink arise ye princes it appears by the account of xenophon that when gobryas and his men first entered the palace in that fatal night they found the king and his princes assembled and the king standing with a drawn scymitar in his hand ready to oppose them notwithstanding his extreme consternation just before on hearing the miraculous prediction of his fate that he might endeavor to persuade his princes to stand by him and resist the enemy though indeed the learned vitringa supposes that the words arise ye princes and anoint the shield refer to the speech of cyrus just before the assault recorded likewise by xenophon  a  etc   and anoint the shield etc isaiah xxi      the prophet jeremiah also alludes to the same fatal babylonian supper which seems to have been intended as a festivity to the honor of their false deities we read in daniel v   that they drank wine and praised the gods of gold and of silver of brass of iron of wood and of stone    in order to insure success against the besiegers  in their heat or in their anger that is against their enemies in the war i will make their feasts and i will make them drunken that they may rejoice and sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake says the lord i will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter that is without opposition or resistance on their part which is described also in the  0th verse of the same chapter  the mighty men of babylon have forborne to fight they have remained in their holds their might has failed they became as women they that is the enemy have burned her dwelling places her bars are broken one post shall run to meet another to show the king of babylon that his city is taken at one end and that the passages are stopped and the reeds they have burned with fire and the men of war are affrighted etc    like rams with hegoats how is sheshach taken and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised alluding to the unexpected entry of the enemy how is babylon become an astonishment among the nations etc jer li to ver    and the manner of bringing about this vengeance as well as the reason of it is further described in the same chapter  for the lord god of recompenses said the prophet ver    shall surely requite and i will make drunk her princes and her wise men her captains and her rulers and her mighty men and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake says the king whose name is the lord of hosts  viz jehovah of armies thus says the lord of hosts the broad walls of babylon shall be utterly broken and her high gates shall be burned with fire and the people shall labor in vain and the folk in the fire and they shall be weary jer li         the armies of gods wrath upon babylon were led by cyrus who was expressly called upon by name and appointed to this service about two hundred years before he was born clanks annotations  and deliverance also by his hand from bondage was promised at the same time to the jews even many years before they were carried into captivity  remember these o jacob and israel for thou art my servant i have formed thee thou art my servant o israel thou shall not be forgotten of me i have blotted out as a thick cloud thy transgressions and as a cloud thy sins return unto me for i have redeemed thee that is from the babylonish slavery as the remainder of the chapter will show sing o ye heavens for the lord has done it shout ye lower parts of the earth break forth into singing ye mountains o forest and every tree therein for the lord has redeemed jacob if the redemption of the jews even from temporal slavery was esteemed a subject of joy and triumph to the universe heaven and earth how much more will the world have cause to rejoice when the lord shall redeem them also from that spiritual slavery and hardness of heart in which they remain at present how much more interesting to all the world will be their last great and glorious return to their redeemer if the fall of them said the apostle paul be the riches of the world and the diminishing of them the riches of the gentiles how much more their fullness romans xi    and he tells us again in the   th verse that blindness in part is happened to israel until the fullness of the gentiles be come in and so shall all israel be saved etc and again in the   d verse  that god has included them all in unbelief that he might have mercy upon all    and glorified himself in israel thus says the lord thy redeemer and he that formed thee from the womb i am the lord jehovah that makes all things that stretches forth the heavens alone that spreads abroad the earth by myself that frustrateth the tokens of the liars and makes diviners mad that turns wise men backward and makes their knowledge foolish referring probably to the unprofitable sciences and vain politics of the chaldeans that confirms the word of his servant and performs the counsel of his messengers that says to jerusalem thou shall be inhabited that is after the appointed desolation and to the cities of judah ye shall be built and i will raise up the decayed places thereof that says to the deep whereby according to the targum babel is meant be dry and i will dry up thy rivers most probably alluding to the successful stratagem of cyrus to dry up the rivers by altering their course whereby he gained an unsuspected passage into the city through the emptied channels in the language of the prophets says mr cruden in his concordance waters often denote a great multitude of people  and this prophecy perhaps might allude to the vast conflux of people at babylon that god would dry them up by making the place desolate but yet the literal sense is certainly to be preferred because it seems to have had a literal accomplishment in the successful stratagem of cyrus abovementioned  certe de babylone est sermo says the learned forerius per quam fluebant flumina tigris and euphrates quorum cursum avertit cyrus ut exsiccato alveo subintrarent milites civitatem etc crit sac tom   p      and grotius upon the same text says hoc pertinet ad id quod cyrus fecit ut babylonem caperet amnem cnim euphratem diffidit and part ejus in lacus abducta per alveum veterem in urbem ingressus est historia est apud jeremiam li    and apud herodotum   that says of cyrus he is my shepherd and shall perform all my pleasure even saying to jerusalem thou shall be built and to the temple thy foundation shall be laid isaiah xliv        and in the   th chapter the great restorer of temporal liberty is further revealed  thus says the lord to his anointed to cyrus whose right hand i have holden to subdue nations before him and i will loose the loins of kings see the former account concerning the extreme fear of the king of babylon and his princes to open before him the twoleaved gates and the gates shall not be shut compare this with zenophons account of the palace gates being opened on the first alarm i will go before thee and make the crooked places straight i will break in pieces the gates of brass and cut in sunder the bars of iron and i will give thee the treasures of darkness and hidden riches of secret places alluding probably to the immense quantities of gold in the secret chapels of the babylonish idols within the great ancient herodotus who was at babylon before the persian conquest gives some account of this according to the intelligence he had received from the babylonish priests for strangers were not permitted to see them whereby they might with great propriety be called  the hidden riches of secret places and they were also very properly called treasures of darkness being dedicated to demons for the greatest part of the gold was worked up into the various imaginary forms of the false deities there was one golden idol of jupiter of an immense size   tower that thou may know that i the lord which call thee by thy name am the god of israel and in the next verse the prophet assigns the reason why the almighty thus called upon cyrus viz  for jacob my servants sake and israel mine elect i have even called thee by thy name i have surnamed thee though thou have not known me i am the lord or rather i am jehovah and there is none else there is no god beside me i girded thee or strengthened thee though thou have not known me etc and gods purpose in raising up cyrus is still more clearly declared in the   th verse  i have raised him up in righteousness and i will direct all his ways he shall build my city and he shall let go my captives mark this ye wretched slaveholders not for price nor reward says the lord of hosts and accordingly the proclamation of freedom to the jews and the decree for rebuilding the temple were made in the first year of cyrus see ezra i    now let my readers seriously compare these accounts of gods peculiar favor to cyrus the restorer of liberty with the accounts which i have already recited of gods opposite treatment of that man who opened not the house of his prisoners isaiah xiv     cyrus by the almighty was expressly called in the   th chapter of isaiah his anointed  thus says the lord to his anointed to cyrus and  literally to his messiah in the septuagint the passage is rendered  and literally from thence in the latin vulgate christo meo cyro to cyrus my christ by munster it is rendered meschiae suo hoc est says he regi suo vocatur autem coresch seu cyrus meschias and rex domini quod ille ordinaverit eum in regem per quem disposuerat devastare regnum babylonicum quodque christi very meschiae typum gereret crit sac tom   p    0 and the learned forerius upon the same text remarks as follows nomine  reges propter unctionem dicebantur cyrum autem suum regem vocat dominus quod ab eo electus fuisset and quod ad implendam voluntatem suam eum destinasset illi etenim reges qui servis dei favent qui eos in libertatem asserunt qui hosts eorum oppugnant digni sunt qui dei reges dicantur verum enimvero quia de reductione captivitatis instituebat sermonem de cyro per quem eos reducturus erat plura dicendi cepit occasionem quod is esset christi domini typus and figura crit sac tom   p         to cyrus etc for cyrus by freely restoring a great nation to their natural liberty from a heavy bondage under the babylonian tyrant might justly be esteemed a type of that future great restorer to universal liberty foretold by the same prophet who was afterward to enfranchise all mankind from a much worse bondage under the empire of satan the spirit of the lord god is upon me because the lord  viz jehovah has anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord and the day of vengeance of our god etc isaiah lxi     and also in a former chapter  to open the blind eyes to bring out the prisoners from the prison and them that sit in darkness out of the prisonhouse etc chap xlii   this prophecy of isaiah that christ should proclaim liberty to the captives was acknowledged and read even by christ himself in the synagogue of nazareth on the sabbathday the evangelist luke gives an account of this remarkable event chap iv and seems to have blended together the two prophecies which i have recited above as neither of them singly will answer exactly the quotation he has given from isaiah though taken together they amount very nearly to the same thing    and declared to be then fulfilled  this day said our lord is this scripture fulfilled in your ears but alas the greatest part of the nation obstinately and wickedly rejected that glorious freedom which was then proclaimed whereby they drew down gods severe vengeance upon themselves being soon after deprived even of that temporal inheritance which they seemed to value above all other things after suffering the most extraordinary slaughters and calamities of an unsuccessful and destructive war in defense of it and of their temporal liberties and they remain in exile to this day a living testimony to the truth of prophecy and when he jesus was come near that is to jerusalem he beheld the city and wept over it saying if thou had known even thou at least in this thy day the things which belong unto thy peace but now they are hid from thine eyes for the days shall come upon thee that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee and compass thee round and keep thee in on every side  and it is very remarkable that the romans after trying all the usual means in vain should at length be obliged to have recourse to this method before they could succeed and shall lay thee even with the ground and thy children within thee and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another because thou knew not the time of thy visitation luke xix        thus christ proclaimed the day of vengeance of our god  agrecable to isaiahs prophecy already recited in this note p        and an example to all the nations wherever they are difpersed of gods vengeance against the rejecters of his divine revelation     this spiritual freedom is indeed clearly tendered to all men but how many are they who for the sake of a little worldly profit are again entangled in the snares and temptations of their spiritual enemy and submit themselves to his bondage how can we suppose that those men are free from the mammon of unrighteousness who are led by the temptations of private interest to infringe the natural rights of mankind by uncharitably retaining their fellow men in an involuntary servitude  can any injury except that of taking away a mans life exceed that of taking away a mans liberty who has never offended us can any robbery or injustice whatsoever be more atrocious than that of wearing out our poor brethren in a hard involuntary service without wages or reward thereby continually robbing them of the fruit of their labors have i not shown by unquestionable examples from scripture that this is a crying sin and that the almighty has denounced woe woe unto him that builds his house by unrighteousness and his chambers by wrong that uses his neighbors service without wages and gives him not for his work etc jer xxii      against all such offenders do we not profess to serve the same god who so severely punished the jews for this very crime and is there any just ground to hope that god who spared not his own peculiar people will nevertheless excuse the inhabitants of great britain and her colonies when they are wilfully guilty of the same offense  the whole tenor of the scriptures teaches us that slavery was ever detestable in the sight of god insomuch that it has generally been denounced and of course inflicted as the punishment of the most abandoned sinners of which i have already given a great variety of instances  let us therefore before it is too late take warning by these tremendous examples of gods vengeance against this kind of oppression which the scriptures hold forth not only to this nation but to all the world besides the examples which i have quoted of gods vengeance denounced against the israelites and jews for tyranny are not more striking than the examples of vengeance denounced against the very instruments of that vengeance the assyrians and babylonians expressly on the same account for though the latter were mere instruments in gods hand to punish the jews in kind yet they were themselves subjected to the like retribution  nay the vengeance was denounced particularly against the chaldeans and the cause of it also was declared long before they were guilty of the offense as i have before remarked even while the jews the nation vindicated by this punishment were exercising that tyranny at home for which they were then doomed to the babylonian yoke and thereby laid the foundation for the future retaliated captivity of their haughty conquerors the chaldeans  and have not we just reason to dread the severe vengeance of almighty god when it is notorious that the tyranny exercised in the british colonies is infinitely more unmerciful than that which was formerly exercised by the chaldeans insomuch that the state of the jews in their captivity might be esteemed rather as freedom than bondage when compared with the deplorable servitude of the wretched negro slaves as well as of the white servants in our colonies  what must be the consequence of such abominable wickedness  by as much as we exceed the assyrians and babylonians in religious knowledge by so much more severely may we expect the hand of god upon us for our monstrous abuse of such advantages  the inhabitants of great britain and the inhabitants of the colonies seem to be almost equally guilty of oppression  the colonies protest against the iniquity of the slave trade but nevertheless continue to hold the poor wretched slaves in a most detestable bondage great britain indeed keeps no slaves but publicly encourages the slave trade and contemptuously neglects or rejects every petition or attempt of the colonists against that notorious wickedness  the house of burgesses in virginia transmitted a very sensible and respectful petition to the king extracts from the minutes of the house of burgesses in virginia  wednesday april  st      most gracious sovereign we your majestys dutiful and loyal subjects the burgesses of virginia now met in general assembly beg leave with all humility to approach your royal presence  the many instances of your majestys benevolent intentions and most gracious disposition to promote the prosperity and happiness of your subjects in the colonies encouraged us to look up to the throne and implore your majestys paternal assistance in averting a calamity of a most alarming nature  the importation of slaves into the colonies from the coast of africa has long been considered as a trade of great inhumanity and under its present encouragement we have too much reason to fear will endanger the very existence of your majestys american dominions  we are sensible that some of your majestys subjects in great britain may reap emolument from this sort of traffic but when we consider that it greatly retards the settlement of the colonies with more white inhabitants and may in time have the most destructive influence we presume to hope that the interest of a few will be disregarded when placed in competition with the security and happiness of such numbers of your majestys dutiful and loyal subjects  deeply impressed with these sentiments we most humly beseech your majesty to remove all those restraints on your majestys governors of this colony which inhibit their assenting to such laws as might check so very pernicious a commerce  your majestys ancient colony and dominion of virginia has at all times and upon every occasion been entirely devoted to your majestys facred person and government and we cannot forego this opportunity of renewing those assurances of the truest loyalty and warmest affection which we have so often with the greatest sineerity given to the best of kings whose wisdom and goodness we esteem the surest pledge of the happiness of all his people  resolved nemine contradicente that the house does agree with the committee in the said address to be presented to his majesty  resolved that an address be presented to his excellency the governor to desire that he will be pleased to transmit the address to his majesty and to support it in such manner as he shall think most likely to promote the desirable end proposed  copy     dated the  st of april concerning the iniquity inhumanity and destructive influence of the african slave trade to which not the least answer has yet been returned  the freeholders and inhabitants of the county of somerset in new jersey also through their regard to the civil and religious interest of the country and the established rights of mankind presented to the governor council and representatives of that province a very seasonable testimony against that wicked traffic which has slavery for it is object praying them to provide against the future importation of slaves into that colony and to enable such persons as shall choose it to manumit their slaves upon equitable principles to the owners and the public etc to the governor council and representatives of the province of new jersey in general assembly met  the petition of sundry freeholders and inhabitants of the county of somerset  respectfully shows  that your petitioners influenced with an equal regard to the civil and religious interests of this province and the established rights of mankind have with concern often viewed that traffic which has slavery for it is object in a light very unfriendly to both and it has afforded pleasure to observe the liberal advances which of late have been made among all ranks of people toward the discountenance of that trade and promotion of justice to those who have thereby been deprived of their liberty hence your petitioners are induced to address the legislature and to request that a subject so important may receive that attention which it deserves your petitioners also beg that you will not only provide against the future importation of slaves into this colony by such ways as you may think best but to enable such persons as shall choose it to manumit them by making them useful and happy upon equitable principles to the owners and the public as in your wisdom may appear most conducive to those good ends and your petitioners shall pray etc    another petition upon the like benevolent principles was presented to the same assembly by diverse inhabitants of the county of essex in the said province wherein they also signified their dissatisfaction concerning an act of assembly in force for preventing the manumitting and setting free any negro slave etc whereby many are obliged to keep their fellow men in a slavery to them unlawful and contrary to their christian principles etc and they exhort the assembly to obtain an alteration of his majestys instruction to the governor relating to the african trade etc to the honorable house of representatives now sitting at burlington in the province of new jersey  the humble petition of diverse inhabitants of the county of essex in the said province shows  that many of his majestys loyal subjects in this province observe with uneasiness the great increase of negro slaves from the coast of africa which is considered not only as preventative of the importation and increase of white servants and laborers by which the present extravagant price of labor would be proportionably lessened but also as laying a foundation of that which may hereafter prove dangerous to government and subversive of the liberties of the people it being justly observed that slaves are the natural enemies of society and their numbers must always be dangerous it is also with dissatisfaction that some of the inhabitants of this province observe an act of assembly in force for preventing the manumitting and setting free any negro slave however healthy and able to earn his or her living without such terms as many are wholly unable to and others cannot without great difficulty comply with whereby they are obliged to keep their fellow men in a slavery to them unlawful and contrary to their christian principles in order therefore to remedy these growing evils your petitioners humbly pray this honorable house that they would take such measures as to them in their wisdom may seem meet to obtain an alteration of his majestys instruction to his excellency the governor relating to the african trade so that his excellency may be at liberty to consent to such laws for the preventing the future importation of negro slaves into this province as to the legislature may appear just and reasonable and also that the act of assembly relating to the manumitting of negro slaves may be repealed and the inhabitants of this province allowed by law to set free any of their negro slaves who shall appear to some proper judicature to be able of body and sound in mind and under a certain age to be fixed by this honorable house or under such other reasonable restrictions as to the legislature may seem just and reasonable  and your petitioners as in duty bound shall ever pray   a number also of the inhabitants of the city and county of philadelphia bore the like testimony against the african trade in a pathetic and earnest petition to their provincial assembly wherein they take notice of the example set them by the province of virginia in petitioning the king from a deep sensibility of the danger and pernicious consequences which will be attendant on a continuation of this most iniquitous traffic to the representatives of the freemen of the province of pennsylvania in assembly met  the petition of a number of the inhabitants of the city and county of philadelphia  respectfully shows  that the importation of the natives of guinea to be sold and used as slaves in the provinces and islands of the british dominions in america has long been an occasion of deep concern to a great number of the inhabitants of this province as well on account of its inconsistency with the whole tenor of the christian religion as because of the evil influence it has on the religious and moral conduct of the people and the dreadful consequence which it is to be feared will one day attend in those parts where it prevails  we are the more encouraged to lay this important object before you as we understand some of the colonies have been led into serious consideration as well of the iniquity of the practice as of the dangerous situation some of them are in particularly the province of virginia whose house of burgesses has lately petitioned the king from a deep sensibility of the danger and pernicious consequences which will be attendant on a continuation of this most iniquitous traffic  we your petitioners therefore most earnestly beseech you to take this matter which we apprehend to be of the utmost consequence to the welfare and safety of the british colonies under your most serious consideration and to use your utmost endeavors with the other colonies in making such representations to the king as to you may appear most effectual toward putting a stop to this mighty evil  signed by about two hundred persons amongst whom were the provost of the academy and three other clergymen of the church of england being all that are in this city sive presbyterian clergymen and four other ministers the rest respectable inhabitants    but the assembly being desirous first to know what reception the abovementioned neglected virginian petition had met with at court postponed their address to the throne and instead of it transmitted an act of assembly for the kings assent whereby they laid a heavy duty on the head of every slave that should be imported amounting almost to a prohibition of the iniquitous traffic but this seasonable attempt to discourage the crying national sin met with a very cold reception it seems on this side of the atlantic and the bill was absolutely rejected so that the horrid guilt of persisting in that monstrous wickedness must rest on this side of the atlantic is this  to execute judgment and righteousness is this to deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor is this to do no wrong to do no violence to the stranger  does not the same god who warned the impolitic zedekiah by the mouth of his prophet also equally warn us by the written word which he has given to us for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness   timothy iii     does he not equally warn us by these everlasting records of his tremendous judgments and dreadful vengeance even against his own peculiar people for  all these things happened unto them for ensamples as i have before observed and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come   cor x     and yet with all these spiritual advantages i fear we far exceed the jews in the enormity and multitude of our national oppressions how then shall we escape the just vengeance of god if we persevere in these inhuman practices is this the return we make to god for the blessing of a christian education surely he has expected better thing of us have we not just reason to fear that he will condemn this nation as he did the jews of old saying  he looked for judgment but behold oppression for righteousness but behold a cry isaiah v    as god never changes it is impossible that this nation should escape his just retribution and still persist in violating the natural rights of mankind  reflect my countrymen for a moment upon the present state of those enormous national transgressions the african slave trade encouraged in great britain and the toleration of slavery in the british colonies and you will readily perceive that we must stand condemned even if we judge ourselves and how then shall we appear before that righteous judge who is no respecter of persons how can we hope to escape the divine vengeance when we know that the almighty has even bound himself with a most solemn oath never to forget any such acts of oppression the lord has sworn by the excellency of jacob surely i will never forget any of their works or rather all their works  amongst which the slave trade in particular is expressly mentioned in the preceding verse viz buying the poor for silver etc and then he condescends to appeal as i before remarked to human judgment concerning the propriety or rather the necessity and certainty of the divine vengeance for such national wickedness  shall not the land tremble for this and every one mourn that dwells therein amos viii      and in like manner by the prophet jermiah  shall i not visit for these things shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this chap v   these judgments indeed were denounced against the jews but surely common sense must teach us that they are equally applicable at home that is on such a nation as this my countrymen  but there is still a way to escape if my countrymen have but grace to take warning and therefore to the unquestionable examples of gods retribution and vengeance which i have already given let me add before i conclude on very remarkable example of gods vengeance for national oppression being actually averted by the seasonable interposition of a few individuals who procured the dismission and enfranchisement of a large body of poor enslaved people and thereby appeased the denounced wrath of our merciful god  in the beginning of the   th chapter of the second book of chronicles an account is given of the abominable idolatry and wickedness of ahaz king of judah who even burned his children in the fire and by that superlative degree of uncharitableness and inhumanity demonstrated a voluntary submission to that heavy yoke of bondage under the grand spiritual enemy of mankind from which the almighty protector of the creation had so gloriously delivered his ancestors after the abominations says the text of the heathen whom the lord had cast out before the children of israel he sacrificed also and burned incense in the high places and on the hills and under every green tree wherefore the lord his god delivered him into the hand of the king of syria and they smote him and carried away a great multitude of them captives and brought them to damascus and he was also delivered into the hand of the king of israel who smote him with a great slaughter for pekah the king of israel the son of remaliah slew in judah an hundred and twenty thousand in one day all valiant men because they had forsaken the lord god of their fathers and zichri a mighty man of ephraim slew maaseiah the kings son and azrikam the governor of the house and elkanah that was next to the king and the children of israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand women sons and daughters and took also away much spoil from them and brought the spoil to samaria but a prophet of the lord was there whose name was oded and he went out before the host that came to samaria tha it is as they returned from the war to samaria with their captives and booty and said unto them behold because the lord god of your fathers was wroth with judah he has delivered them into your hand and ye have slain them in a rage that reaches up unto heaven and now said the prophet ye purpose to keep under the children of judah and jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you but are there not with you even with you sins against the lord your god now hear me therefore and deliver the captives again which ye have taken captive of your brethren for the fierce wrath of the lord is upon you   chronicles xxviii       and may it not be said in these latter days with equal truth to the inhabitants of great britain and her colonies are there not with you even with you sins against the lord your god that is are there not with you already a sufficient number of sins for which unless you repent you will certainly be accountable but that you must presumptuously add to your sins and to your trespass the horrid guilt of slavery and oppression to hasten gods vengeance upon you but that you must suddenly heap up the measure of your iniquity by tolerating in your colonies a much more grievous slavery a much more numerous bondage than the israelites were ever guilty of yet in israel there were found four chiefs or noblemen  heads of the children of ephraim who were zealous to avert gods wrath and save their country by a speedy restoration of the jewish captives to their natural freedom they valiantly stood up against them that came from the war  which were probably not only pekah their king and his princes but also the principal warriors of their country see the  th  th and   th verses  and said unto them ye shall not bring in the captives hither  these were peremptory terms which showed that they were ready to risk their lives in so good a cause and at the same time they assigned the reason of their opposition in a solemn protest  for whereas said they we have offended against the lord already ye intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass  for our trespass is great and thereis fierce wrath against israel ver        this reason as well as the undaunted resolution of those who gave it had the proper effect upon the israelitish soldiers who notwithstanding the general depravity of their countrymen still deserved the name of men by demonstrating that they were not insensible to reason and that they thought themselves entitled though soldiers to that common right of human nature the right of judging for themselves in matters of conscience without which no man can be truly honorable for as soon as they heard the just remonstrance of the four noblemen they quitted the prey and the plunder a hard thing for soldiers to submit to without waiting it seems for the word of command from the king or his princes  so the armed men says the text lest the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation ver     here be pleased to observe is a national council at once assembled in the field the whole power of the people  the princes and all the congregation  what were their deliberations on this occasion does not appear nor their resolutions or rather they seem to have been totally irresolute wavering between what was a right to be done and private interest as if each man was unwilling to give up his share of the booty and yet ashamed openly to resist the active resolution of the four chiefs on so charitable a cause for these four noblemen it seems at last boldly took upon themselves the whole business  and the men says the text which were expressed by name viz the four noblemen mentioned in the   th verse rose up and took the captives and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them and arrayed them and shod them and gave them to eat and to drink and anointed them and carried all the feeble of them upon asses and brought them to jericho the city of palm trees to their brethren then they returned to samaria thus an immediate judgment from god upon israel was averted by the spirited opposition of four individuals against a whole nation but great britain and her colonies which forcibly detain more than four times the number by an account of the european settlements in america printed in    0 we are informed that there are allowed to be in our west indies at least two hundred and thirty thousand negro slaves vol   p      in virginia says the same author much the larger part of the inhabitants are the negro slaves who cannot be much fewer than an hundred thousand souls they annually import says he into the two tobacco colonies between three and four thousand of these slaves p         and in maryland as the same author informs us in p     the negroes are upwards of sixty thousand  the number of slavesalready mentioned without reckoning the multitudes since transported to the new increasing settlements in the grenada islands and in the islands of tobago dominica and st vincents as also exclusive of the multitudes in the two carolinas the two floridas georgia the two jerseys new york etc amount to three hundred and ninety thousand souls at the least computation so that if the multitudes actually omitted in this account were truly added the oppression would appear enormous the total amount of the oppressed multitude perhaps would not fall far short of the numerous bondage of oppressed israelites which first drew down the exemplary and ever memorable vengeance of the almighty upon the hardened egyptian tyrant and his kingdom   of wretched captives in an involuntary servitude much more intolerable than any that the israelites were ever guilty of exacting  great britain which recruits the ravages of her cruelty oppression and injustice by an annual supply of more than fifty thousand poor see note in page     african strangers against whom they have not the least pretense of war or quarrel  men and women sons and daughters  for bondmen and for bondwomen to be worn out with unremitted labor like those poor injured creatures whose places they supplied  great britain i say with all this accumulated load of guilt has not yet produced four chiefs or noblemen to protest against this most abominable tyranny and to stand in the gap with reverential fear of god to avert the divine vengeance though religion humanity and even common sense ought to have prompted them to it  may we not too aptly compare the principal crimes of the jews for which they lost their liberty to the present crying sins of great britain and her colonies  in the midst of thee said a prophet from god have they dealt by oppression with the stranger in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow ezekiel xxii   and again the people of the land have used oppression and exercised robbery and have vexed the poor and needy yea they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully and i sought for a man among them that should make up the hedge and stand in the gap before me for the land that i should not destroy it but i sound none therefore have i poured out mine indignation upon them i have consumed them with the fire of my wrath their own way have i recompensed upon their heads says the lord god ezekiel xxii        and have not the inhabitants of great britain and her colonies therefore just reason to expect a similar vengeance for the like oppressions do they flatter themselves that the same god will permit them to go on without recompensing their own way upon their heads slavery for slavery or have they forgot that the god of israel who thus reproved his peculiar people for holding their brethren in bondage is the same lord god with whom we have to do and that he is unchangeable how would our rulers and chief men bear a repetition of this unchangeable word in the presence of god when the books are opened for judgment  i sought for a man among them that should make up the hedge and stand in the gap before me for the land that i should not destroy it but i found none may i not say that even backsliding israel shall rise up in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it as the backsliding israel has justified herself more than treacherous judah jer iii    so she has surely justified herself more than britain for when the measure of her iniquity seemed to be filled by that notorious act of oppression in the reign of pekah beforementioned there were yet found in her four worthy advocates to stand in the gap before god for the land even four chiefs or nobles of the children of ephraim who boldly protested against the horrid crime of domestic slavery but great britain though staggering under a much heavier load of the same kind of guilt has not produced out of her numerous peerage one single chief to stand up for the land and remove her burden mark this ye right reverend fathers of our church who sit with the princes of the realm to consult the welfare of the state think not that i am inclined through any misguided prejudice if i am prejudiced at all i am sure it is in favor of episcopacy for i not only entertain a most sincere personal respect and esteem for several truly worthy and learned individuals of that order now living but i am even descended from one of the same holy function who in his correspondence with foreign protestant churches very ably defended and promoted the establishment of episcopacy and above all i am thoroughly convinced by the holy scriptures that the institution of that order in the christian church is of god and that the only defect in the english establishment of it is the want of a free election the learned judge blackstone in his commentaries book i c    p     informs us that election was in very early times the usual mode of elevation to the episcopal chair throughout all christendom and this says he was promiscuously performed by the laity as well as by the clergy  per clerum and populum for which he cites very ample authorities but afterward a complaint of tumultuous elections together with the supposed royal prerogative of granting the investiture of temporalities though the temporalities being originally granted to support the dignity of the office cannot reasonably be so far drawn from the first intention as to deprive the office of that real dignity which arises from a free election served the designs of emperors and kings as a pretense to invade the freedom of election and the same pretense of tumult proved equally favorable to the opposite designs of popes so that these jarring interests seemed united however in their endeavors as it were by one spirit of antichrist to deprive the church of her ancient right which had it been maintained would probably have prevented most of the future usurpations of the papal antichrist and therefore the policy of the court of rome at the same time began by degrees to exclude the laity from any share in these elections says the learned judge blackstone and to confine them wholly to the clergy which at length was completely effected   blackstone c    p     the original ground for the complaint of tumult in these elections was probably occasioned by the neglect of that unexceptionable apostolic mode of election described in acts i    to    for when christianity began to be corrupted by vows of celibacy and other popish and diabolical doctrines the clergy and laity began to have opposite interests to serve which ought never to be in the choice of their bishop and of course the two contending parties would reciprocally depend upon their own activity zeal or address for success in the election so that tumult the old complaint must be the necessary consequence whereas had it been an indispensible form to nominate two qualified persons viz either two by the promiscuous suffrages of both parties or one by each party and afterward in solemn prayer to submit the final decision to the providence of god by a lot as in the apostolic election there could be no room for contention the undue influence and partiality of individuals would be effectually checked and above all the joint prayers of both parties in an appeal to gods decision would certainly add solemnity instead of tumult to the election if not also much additional dignity to the elected dum secum habebant apostoli dominum non usi sunt sort neque post adventum paracloti ea sunt usi c x    xvi   ss sed in uno hoc intermedio tempore and in uno hoc negotio usi sunt convenientissime bengelii gnomon nov test p   0 this remark opens to us a very satisfactory reason why the apostles discontinued the primitive mode of election and took upon themselves the appointment of bishops for while they were endowed with manifest supernatural power in working miracles their authority to appoint bishops without the formulary precautions of the first precedent could not be questioned because their appointment of bishops was clearly the appointment of the holy ghost but when these extraordinary gifts ceased in the church the primitive mode of election became once more desirable as being best suited to the ordinary state of the church in all succeeding ages this is not a singular opinion of my own the learned bengelius p     refers us not only to those who have thought as i do but also to examples of it is having been really practiced in episcopal elections  hodie quoque in elegend is episcopis sorti locum esse posse censet justus jonas ad hunc locum and memorabile exemplum resert comenius in histecoles slav  0 habet etiam b riegerus bohm br vol iii p    the primitive election mentioned in the acts was the election of a bishop as well as of an apostle the office or charge of a bishop being apparently included in the apostolic dignity for though matthias on whom the lot fell was immediately numbered among the eleven apostles yet the vacant charge to which he was elected was un questionably an episcopal charge the expression of the holy ghost in the prophecy of the psalmist psalm cix    let another take his office proves that the said office was of that nature for the hebrew word  commonly rendered his office properly signifies a visitatorial office which expression by the ancient authors of the septuagint version as well as the apostle peter was conceived to be of the same general import as an office of superintendency and therefore they all called it an episcopate  literally let another take his episcopate or bishopric matthias therefore and the other apostles were properly  or bishops and the right of nomination to the vacant charge was not then confined to the apostles alone as dr hammond without authority of scripture has asserted but an appeal was made to the sense of the whole congregation the  or crowd of   0 persons then present by the apostle peter and they accordingly appointed two  and afterward joining in solemn prayer submitted the decision or final election by lot to the providence of god  thou lord said they  which know the hearts of all men show of these two the one whom thou have chosen   the person on whom the lot fell might from the  0t  be truly denominated clericus as he was thereby authorized to take upon himself the lot of service  ton kahpon  the very learned and judicious erasmus was of the same opinion respecting the appointment of two persons by the congregation or   haec oration says he speaking of peters address to the people  quum placuisset multitudini statuerunt duos etc and a little afterward he gives the following commendation of that primitive example  tametsi sorts periculosae non sunt quae utricunque faverint probum and idoneum designant nec torum negotium creditum est sortibus suffragiis sunt electi duo probatissimi inter hos ambiguitatem electionis finiit sors quae nec ipsa temeritatem habere potuit cujus eventum moderatur precatio sors igitur haec quae nihil aliudsuit quam declaratio divinae voluntatis designavit matthiam quanquam joseph praeter cognominis viz justus commendationem etiam jesu propinquitate commendebatur et tamen huic praelatus est matthias quo nos doceremur in deligendis epis copis quibus credenda sit evangelicae doctrinae dispensatio adeo nihil esse tribuendum humanis affectibus etc   to the office for as it may clearly be proved that the churches of britain and ireland have a just and ancient right to elect their own bishops and did actually exercise that right for many ages till the antichristian usurpations of monks and popes over the secular or parochial clergy occasioned the interference of kings so it may as clearly be demonstrated that the present mode of election by writ of conge d eslire sent to the several cathedral chapters together with a letter missive containing the name of the person which they shall elect and chase agreeable to the act of    hen viii cli xx sec   is a total perversion of that just and ancient right in a little tract by john barnes an english benedictine entitled sententia de ecclesiae britannicae privilegiis which was printed together with some little tracts of archbishop usher in      we find still a more ample testimony of the ancient right of choosing bishops  cum antiqui mores ecclesiae suae speaking of the ancient british scotch and irish postularent ut ommia inter se synodice agerent tum pro episcoporum ordinationibus tum pro aliis negotiis ecclesiasticis verba little ex beda lib ii    eceles hist sunt quod non possunt absque suorum consensu et licentia priscis abdicare moribus p     and after citing an example from bid concerning the election of a bishop viz aidan by a scotch synod at the request of the saxon king oswald to instruct and preside over the ministry of the newly converted saxon or english church see p     and     he further remarks  et ex hungtingdoniensi says he lib iii hist and bed lib ii constat et scotos et britannos omnia sua communi consensu egisse  it appears also that the saxon or english church though much less ancient than the british irish and scotch churches did yet enjoy the same inestimable privilege of electing bishops the monk matthew paris has transmitted to us a memorable example of this in his account of the election a d  0   of the celebrated ulstan to be bishop of worcester  processu autemtemporis ulstanus electo ad archiepiscopatum eboracensem aldredo unanimi consensu tam cleri quam totius plebis rege insuper ut quem vellent sibi eligerent praesulem and animarum pastorem annuente in episcopum ejusdem loci eligitur p  0 and even in later times when the romish corruptions had so far prevailed as to exclude the laity from elections yet the clergy still enjoyed the free right of electing their prelates whether abbots or bishops for the learned judge blackstone informs us that this right was granted in a charter to all the monasteries and cathedrals in the kingdom by king john see vol i p     and also that this grant was expressly recognized and confirmed in king johns magna carta and was again established by statute    edward iii st     ibid this statute first gave parliamentary authority indeed to the kings conge d eslire though it was in use long before and acknowledges the kings right of assent or approbation after the election yet it contains nothing which can remove the prudent and reasonable limitation to which that assent or approbation was formerly subject viz that it was not to be denied without a reasonable and lawful cause judge blackstone b i c    p     and this very act which was manifestly ordained to restrain the simoniacal practices and shameful usurpations of the bishops of rome expressly acknowledges the right of free elections in the church viz that the free elections of the archbishops bishops and all other dignities and benefices elective in england shall hold etc the right was also fully established by preceding statutes still in force though unhappily for this kingdom not in use as   there shall be free election of dignities of the church   edward ii c    title and again elections ought to be free   edward i c   mr ruffhead in his useful index to the statutes very properly refers us under the head of election of bishops to this lastmentioned statute for episcopal elections ought certainly to be included in the meaning of the said statute as well as all other elections for an election without a choice is a manifest contradiction in term and no election   abovementioned and is entirely destructive of all the desirable purposes of a free election this practice however cannot be censured in stronger terms than those in which it is expressly condemned by a subsequent act of parliament   edw vi chap ii though the former act is supposed to be still in force viz the said elections be in very deed no elections but only by a writ of conge deslire have colors shadows and pretenses of elections serving nevertheless to no purpose etc  if it had not been for this notorious defect in point of election and the general idea of its consequences i am persuaded that the late worthy primate of england would not have found such opposition in hi endeavors some few years ago to promote the establishment of episcopacy in america    to charge your order in particular with the omission the crying sin has hitherto been far distant from your sight and perhaps was never fully represented to you or like faithful watchmen of israel you would long ago have warned our nation of the danger but i now call upon you in the name of god for assistance ye know the scriptures and therefore to you my lords in particular i appeal if i have misrepresented the word of god on which my opposition to slavery is founded point out my errors and i submit but if on the other hand you should perceive that the texts here quoted are really applicable to the question before us that my conclusions from thence are fairly drawn and that the examples of gods vengeance against tyrants and slaveholders ought strictly to warn us against similar oppressions and similar vengeance you will not then i trust be backward in this cause of god and man stand up let me entreat you for the land make up the hedge to save your country perhaps it is not yet too late enter a solemn protest my lords against those who have oppressed the stranger wrongfully ye know that the testimonies i have quoted are of god warn therefore the nobles and senators of these kingdoms that they incur not a double load of guilt as the burden not only of the muchinjured african strangers but also of our countrys ruin must rest on the heads of those who withhold their testimony against the crying sin of tolerated slavery for i know that the lord will maintain the cause of the afflicted and
