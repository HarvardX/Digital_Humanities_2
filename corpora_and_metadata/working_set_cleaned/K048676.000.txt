the pleasures of imagination  a poem  the pleasures of imagination  a poem in three books   epict apud arrian ii     sculp    london printed for r dodsley at tullys head in pall mall mdccxliv  the design there are certain powers in human nature which seem to hold a middle place between the organs of bodily sense and the faculties of moral perception they have been called by a very general name the powers of imagination like the external senses they relate to matter and motion and at the same time give the mind ideas analogous to those of moral approbation and dislike as they are the inlets of some of the most exquisite pleasures we are acquainted with men of warm and sensible tempers have sought means to recall the delightful perceptions they afford independent of the objects which originally produced them this gave rise to the imitative or designing arts some of which as painting and sculpture directly copy the external appearances which were admired in nature others as music and poetry bring them back to remembrance by signs universally established and understood  but these arts as they grew more correct and deliberate were naturally led to extend their imitation beyond the peculiar objects of the imaginative powers especially poetry which making use of language as the instrument by which it imitates is consequently become an unlimited representative of every species and mode of being yet as their primary intention was only to express the objects of imagination and as they still abound chiefly in ideas of that class they of course retain their original character and all the different pleasures they excite are termed in general pleasures of imagination  the design of the following poem is to give a view of these in the largest acceptance of the term so that whatever our imagination feels from the agreeable appearances of nature and all the various entertainment we meet with either in poetry painting music or any of the elegant arts might be deducible from one or other of those principles in the constitution of the human mind which are here established and explained  in executing this general plan it was necessary first of all to distinguish the imagination from our other faculties and then to characterize those original forms or properties of being about which it is conversant and which are by nature adapted to it as light is to the eyes or truth to the understanding these properties mr addison had reduced to the three general classes of greatness novelty and beauty and into these we may analyze every object however complex which properly speaking is delightful to the imagination but such an object may also include many other sources of pleasure and its beauty or novelty or grandeur will make a stronger impression by reason of this concurrence besides this the imitative arts especially poetry owe much of their effect to a similar exhibition of properties quite foreign to the imagination insomuch that in every line of the most applauded poems we meet with either ideas drawn from the external senses or truths discovered to the understanding or illustrations of contrivance and final causes or above all the rest with circumstances proper to awaken and engage the passions it was therefore necessary to enumerate and exemplify these different species of pleasure especially that from the passions which as it is supreme in the noblest works of human genius so being in some particulars not a little surprising gave an opportunity to inliven the didactic turn of the poem by introducing a piece of machinery to account for the appearance  after these parts of the subject which hold chiefly of admiration or naturally warm and interest the mind a pleasure of a very different nature that which arises from ridicule came next to be considered as this is the foundation of the comic manner in all the arts and has been but very imperfectly treated by moral writers it was thought proper to give it a particular illustration and to distinguish the general sources from which the ridicule of characters is derived here too a change of style became necessary such a one as might yet be consistent if possible with the general taste of composition in the serious parts of the subject nor is it an easy task to give any tolerable force to images of this kind without running either into the gigantic expressions of the mockheroic or the familiar and pointed raillery of professed satire neither of which would have been proper here  the materials of all imitation being thus laid open nothing now remained but to illustrate some particular pleasures which arise either from the relations of different objects one to another or from the nature of imitation itself of the first kind is that various and complicated resemblance existing between several parts of the material and immaterial worlds which is the foundation of metaphor and wit as it seems in a great measure to depend on the early associations of our ideas and as this habit of associating is the source of many pleasures and pains in life and on that account bears a great share in the influence of poetry and the other arts it is therefore mentioned here and its effects described then follows a general account of the production of these elegant arts and the secondary pleasure as it is called arising from the resemblance of their imitations to the original appearances of nature after which the design is closed with some reflections on the general conduct of the powers of imagination and on their natural and moral usefulness in life  concerning the manner or turn of composition which prevails in this piece little can be said with propriety by the author he had two models that ancient and simple one of the first grecian poets as it is refined by virgil in the georgics and the familiar epistolary way of horace this latter has several advantages it admits of a greater variety of style it more readily ingages the generality of readers as partaking more of the air of conversation and especially with the assistance of rhyme leads to a closer and more concise expression add to this the example of the most perfect of modern poets who has so happily applied this manner to the noblest parts of philosophy that the public taste is in a great measure formed to it alone yet after all the subject before us tending almost constantly to admiration and enthusiasm seemed rather to demand a more open pathetic and figured style this too appeared more natural as the authors aim was not so much to give formal precepts or enter into the way of direct argumentation as by exhibiting the most engaging prospects of nature to enlarge and harmonize the imagination and by that means insensibly dispose the minds of men to the same dignity of taste in religion morals and civil life it is on this account that he is so careful to point out the benevolent intention of the author of nature in every principle of the human constitution here insisted on and also to unite the moral excellencies of life in the same point of view with the mere external objects of good taste thus recommending them in common to our natural propenstiy for admiring what is beautiful and lovely the same views have also led him to introduce some sentiments which may perhaps be looked upon as not quite direct to the subject but since they bear an obvious relation to it the authority of virgil the faultless model of didactic poetry will best support him in this particular for the sentiments themselves he makes no apology  argument of the first book the subject proposed verse   to  0 difficulty of treating it poetically v    the ideas of the divine mind the origin of every quality pleasing to the imagination v    to    the

this goodly frame of nature touches the consenting hearts of mortal men and what the pleasing stores which beauteous imitation thence derives to deck the poets or the painters toil my verse unfolds

autumnal skies and vernal showers and all the fair variety of things but not alike to every mortal eye is this great scene unveiled for since the claims of social life to different labors urge the active powers of man with wise intent the hand of nature on peculiar minds imprints a different bias and to each decrees its province in the common toil to some she taught the fabric of the sphere the changeful moon the circuit of the stars the golden zones of heaven to some she gave to weigh the moment of eternal things of time and space and fates unbroken chain and wills quick impulse others by the hand she led over vales and mountains to explore what healing virtue swells the tender veins of herbs and flowers or what the beams of morn draw forth distilling from the clifted rind in balmy

statue of memnon so famous in antiquity stood in the temple of serapis at thebes one of the great cities of old egypt it was of a very hard ironlike stone and according to juvenal held in its hand a lyre which being touched by the sunbeams emitted a distinct and agreeable sound tacitus mentions it as one of the principal curiosities which germanicus took notice of in his journey through egypt and strabo affirms that he with many others heard it    by fabling nilus to the quivering touch of titans ray with each repulsive string consenting sounded through the warbling air unbidden strains even

visions where they rise more lovely than when lucifer displays his beaming forehead through the gates of morn to lead the train of phoebus and the spring say why was man so eminently raised say why was man etc in apologizing for the frequent negligence of the sublimest authors of greece those godlike geniuses says longinus were wellassured that nature had not intended man for a lowspirited or ignoble being but bringing us into life and the midst of this wide universe as before a multitude assembled at some heroic solemnity that we might be spectators of all her magnificence and candidates high in emulation for the prize of glory she has therefore implanted in our souls an inextinguishable love of every thing great and exalted of every thing which appears divine beyond our comprehension whence it comes to pass that even the whole world is not an object sufficient for the depth and rapidity of human imagination which often sallies forth beyond the limits of all that surrounds us let any man cast his eye through the whole circle of our existence and consider how especially it abounds in excellent and grand objects he will soon acknowledge for what enjoyments and pursuits we were destined thus by the very propensity of nature we are led to admire not little springs or shallow rivulets however clear and delicious but the nile the rhine the danube and much more than all the ocean etc dionys longin de sublim xxxiv    amid the vast creation why ordained through life and death to dart his piercing eye with thoughts beyond the limit of his frame but that the omnipotent might send him forth in sight of mortal and immortal powers as on a boundless theater to run the great career of justice to exalt his generous aim to all diviner deeds to shake each partial purpose from his breast and through the mists of passion and of sense and through the tossing tide of chance and pain to hold his course unfaltring while the voice of truth and virtue up the steep ascent of nature calls him to his high reward the applauding smile of heaven else wherefore burns in mortal bosoms this unquenched hope that breathes from day to day sublimer things and mocks possession wherefore darts the mind with such resistless ardor to embrace majestic forms impatient to be free spurning the gross control of wilful might proud of the strong contention of her toils proud to be daring who but rather turns to heavens broad fire his unconstrained view than to the glimmering of a waxen flame who that from alpine heights his laboring eye shoots round the wide horizon to survey the nile or ganges roll his wasteful tide through mountains plains through empires black with shade and continents of sand will turn his gaze to mark the windings of a scanty rill that murmurs at his feet the highborn soul disdains to rest her heavnaspiring wing beneath its native quarry tired of earth and this diurnal scene she springs aloft through fields of air pursues the flying storm rides on the volleyd lightning through the heavens or yoked with whirlwinds and the northern blast sweeps the long tract of day then high she soars the blue profound and hovering over the sun beholds him pouring the redundant stream of light beholds his unrelenting sway bend the reluctant planets to absolve the fated rounds of time thence far effusd she darts her swiftness up the long career of devious comets through its burning signs exulting circles the perennial wheel of nature and looks back on all the stars whose blended light as with a milky zone invests the orient now amazed she views the empyreal waste where happy spirits hold the empyreal waste ne se peutil point quil y a un grand espace audela de la region des etoiles que ce soit le ciel empyree ou non toujours cet espace immense qui

to this day    has traveled the profound six thousand years nor yet arrives in sight of mortal things even on the barriers of the world untird she meditates the eternal depth below till half recoiling down the headlong steep she plunges soon overwhelmed and swallowed up in that immense of being there her hopes rest at the fated goal for from the birth of mortal man the sovereign maker said that not in humble or in brief delight not in the fading echoes of renown powers purple robes or pleasures flowery lap the soul should find enjoyment but from these turning disdainful to an equal good through all the ascent of things enlarge her view till every bound at length should disappear and infinite perfection close the scene call now to mind what high capacious powers lie folded up in man how far beyond the praise of mortals may the eternal growth of nature to perfection half divine expand the blooming soul what pity then should sloths unkindly fogs depress to earth her tender blossom choke the streams of life and blast her spring far otherwise designed almighty wisdom natures happy cares thobedient heart far otherwise incline witness the sprightly joy when aught unknown strikes the quick sense and wakes each active power to brisker measures witness the neglect of all familiar prospects though beheld  the neglect of all familiar prospects etc it is here said that in consequence of the love of novelty objects which at first were highly delightful to the mind lose that effect by repeated attention to them but the instance of habit is opposed to this observation for there objects at first distasteful are in time rendered entirely agreeable by repeated attention  the difficulty in this case will be removed if we consider that when objects at first agreeable lose that influence by frequently recurring the mind is wholly passive and the perception involuntary but habit on the other hand generally supposes choice and activity accompanying it so that the pleasure arises here not from the object but from the minds conscious determination of its own activity and consequently increases in proportion to the frequency of that determination  it will still be urged perhaps that a familiarity with disagreeable objects renders them at length acceptable even when there is no room for the mind to resolve or act at all in this case the appearance must be accounted for one of these ways  the pleasure from habit may be merely negative the object at first gave uneasiness this uneasinest gradually wears off as the object grows familiar and the mind finding it at last entirely removed reckons its situation really pleasurable compared with what it had experienced before  the dislike conceived of the object at first might be owing to prejudice or want of attention consequently the mind being necessitated to review it often may at length perceive its own mistake and be reconciled to what it had looked on with aversion in which case a sort of instinctive justice naturally leads it to make amends for the injury by running toward th e other extreme of fondness and attachment  or lastly though the object itself should always continue disagreeable yet circumstances of pleasure or good fortune may occur along with it thus an association may arise in the mind and the object never be remembered without those pleasing circumstances attending it by which means the disagreeable impression it at first occasioned will in time be quite obliterated    with transport once the fond attentive gaze of young astonishment the sober zeal of age commenting on prodigious things for such the bounteous providence of heaven in every breast implanting this desire of objects new and strange to urge us on  this desire of objects new and strange   these two ideas are often confounded though it is evident the mere novelty of an object makes it agreeable even where the mind is not affected with the least degree of wonder whereas wonder indeed always implies novelty being never excited by common or wellknown appearances but the pleasure in both cases is explicable from the same final cause the acquisition of knowledge and enlargement of our views of nature and on this account it is natural to treat of them together    with unremitted labor to pursue those sacred stores that wait the ripening soul in truths exhaustless bosom what need words to paint its power for this the daring youth breaks from his weeping mothers anxious arms in foreign climes to rove the pensive sage heedless of sleep or midnights harmful damp hangs over the

labor will thou fly with laughing autumn to thatlantic isles atlantic isles by these islands which were also called the fortunate the ancients are now generally supposed to have meant the canaries they were celebrated by the poets for the mildness and fertility of the climate for the gardens of the daughters of hesperus the brother of atlas and the dragon which constantly watched their golden fruit till it was slain by the tyrian hercules    and range with him thhesperian field and see wherever his fingers touch the fruitful grove the branches shoot with gold wherever his step marks the

it bends with airy softness from the marble neck the cheek fairblooming and the rosy lip where winning smiles and pleasure sweet as love with sanctity and wisdom tempring blend their soft allurement then the pleasing force of nature and her kind parental care worthier i would sing then all the enamored youth with each admiring virgin to my lyre should throng attentive while i point on high where beautys living image like the morn that wakes in zephyrs arms the blushing may moves onward or as venus when she stood effulgent on the pearly car and smiled fresh from the deep and conscious of her form to see the tritons tune their vocal shells and each coerulean sister of the flood with fond acclaim attend her over the waves to seek the idalian bower ye smiling band of youths and virgins who through all the maze of young desire with rivalsteps pursue this charm of beauty if the pleasing toil can yield a moments respite hither turn your favorable ear and trust my words i do not mean to wake the gloomy form of superstition dressed in wisdoms garb to damp your tender hopes i do not mean to bid the jealous thundrer fire the heavens or shapes infernal rend the groaning earth to fright you from your joys my cheerful song with better omens calls you to the field pleased with your generous ardour in the chase and warm as you then tell me for you know does beauty ever deign to dwell where health and active use are strangers is her charm confessed in aught whose most peculiar ends are lame and fruitless or did nature mean this awful stamp the herald of a lie to hide the shame of discord and disease and catch with fair hypocrisy the heart of idle faith o no with better cares the indulgent mother conscious how infirm her offspring tread the paths of good and ill by this illustrious image in each kind still most illustrious where the object holds its native powers most perfect she by this illumes the headlong impulse of desire and sanctifies his choice the generous glebe whose bosom smiles with verdure the clear tract of streams delicious to the thirsty soul the bloom of nectard fruitage ripe to sense and every charm of animated things are only pledges of a state sincere the integrity and order of their frame when all is well within and every end accomplished thus was beauty sent from heaven the lovely ministress of truth and good in this dark world for truth and good are one and beauty dwells in them and they in her  truth and good are one and beauty dwells in them etc do you imagine says socrates to his libertine disciple that what is good is not also beautiful have you not observed that these appearances always coincide virtue for instance in the same respect as to which we call it good is ever acknowledged to be beautiful also in the characters of men we always this the athenians did in a peculiar manner by the words  join the two denominations together the beauty of human bodies corresponds in like manner with that economy of parts which constitutes them good and in all the circumstances which occurr in life the same object is constantly accounted both beautiful and good inasmuch as it answers the purposes for which it was designed xenophont memorab socrat     c    this excellent observation has been illustrated and extended by the noble restorer of ancient philosophy see the characteristicks vol   p     and     and vol   p     and his most ingenious disciple has particularly shown that it holds in the general laws of nature in the works of art and the conduct of the sciences inquiry into the original of our ideas of beauty and virtue treat     as to the connection between beauty and truth there are two opinions concerning it some philosophers assert an independent and invariable law in nature in consequence of which all rational beings must alike perceive beauty in some certain proportions and deformity in the contrary and this necessity being supposed the same with that which commands the assent or dissent of the understanding it follows of course that beauty is founded on the universal and unchangeable law of truth  but others there are who believe beauty to be merely a relative and arbitrary thing that indeed it was a benevolent design in nature to annex so delightful a sensation to those objects which are best and most perfect in themselves that so we might be engaged to the choice of them at once and without staying to infer their usefulness from their structure and effects but that it is not impossible in a physical sense that two beings of equal capacities for truth should perceive one of them beauty and the other deformity in the same relations and upon this supposition by that truth which is always connected with beauty nothing more can be meant than the conformity of any object to those proportions upon which after careful examination the beauty of that species is found to depend polycletus for instance the famous sculptor of sicyon from an accurate mensuration of the several parts of the most perfect human bodies deduced a canon or system of proportions which was the rule of all succeeding artists suppose a statue modeled according to this canon a man of mere natural taste upon looking at it without entering into its proportions confesses and admires its beauty whereas a professor of the art applies his measures to the head the neck or the hand and without attending to its beauty pronounces the workmanship to be just and true    with like participation wherefore then o sons of earth would you dissolve the tie o wherefore with a rash imperfect aim seek you those flowery joys with which the hand of lavish fancy paints each flattering scene where beauty seems to dwell nor once inquire where is the sanction of eternal truth or where the seal of undeceitful good to save your search from folly wanting these lo beauty withers in your void embrace and with the glittering of an idiots toy did fancy mock your vows nor let the gleam of youthful hope that shines upon your hearts be chilled or clouded at this awful task to learn the lore of undeceitful good and truth eternal though the poisonous charms of baleful superstition guide the feet of servile numbers through a dreary way to their abode through deserts thorns and mire and leave the wretched pilgrim all forlorn to muse at last amid the ghostly gloom of graves and hoary vaults and cloistered cells to walk with specter through the midnight shade and to the screaming owls accursed song attune the dreadful workings of his heart yet be not you dismayed a gentler star your lovely search illumines from the grove where wisdom talked with her athenian sons could my ambitious hand intwine a wreath of platos olive with the mantuan bay then should my powerful voice at once dispel these monkish horrors then in light divine disclose the elysian prospect where the steps of those whom nature charms through blooming walks through fragrant mountains and poetic streams amid the train of sages heroes bards led by their winged genius and the choir of laurelld science and harmonious art proceed exulting to the eternal shrine where truth enthroned with her celestial twins the undivided partners of her sway with good and beauty reigns o let not us lulled by luxurious pleasures languid strain or crouching to the frowns of bigotrage o let not us a moment pause to join the godlike band and if the gracious power that first awakened my untutored song will to my invocation breathe anew the tuneful spirit then through all our paths never shall the sound of this devoted lyre be wanting whether on the rosy mead when summer smiles to warn the melting heart of luxurys allurement whether firm against the torrent and the stubborn hill to urge bold virtues unremitted nerve and wake the strong divinity of soul that conquers chance and fate or whether struck for sounds of triumph to proclaim her toils upon the lofty summit round her brow to twine the wreathe of incorruptive praise to trace her hallowed light through future worlds and bless heavens image in the heart of man thus with a faithful aim have we presumed adventurous to delineate natures form whether in vast majestic pomp arrayed or dressed for pleasing wonder or serene in beautys rosy smile it now remains through various beings fairproportiond scale to trace the rising luster of her charms from their first twilight shining forth at length to full meridian splendor of degree the least and lowliest in theffusive warmth of colors mingling with a random blaze does beauty dwell then higher in the line and variation of determined shape where truths eternal measures mark the bound of circle cube or sphere the third ascent unites this varied symmetry of parts with colours bland allurement as the pearl shines in the concave of its azure bed and painted shells indent their speckled wreathe then more attractive rise the blooming forms through which the breath of nature has infused her genial power to draw with pregnant veins nutritious moisture from the bounteous earth in fruit and seed prolific thus the flowers their purple honors with the spring resume and such the stately tree which autumn bends with blushing treasures but more lovely still is natures charm where to the full consent of complicated members to the bloom of color and the vital change of growth lifes holy flame and piercing sense are given and active motion speaks the tempered soul so moves the bird of juno so the steed with rival ardour beats the dusty plain and faithful dogs with eager airs of joy salute their fellows thus does beauty dwell there most conspicuous even in outward shape where dawns the high expression of a mind by steps conducting our inrapturd search to that eternal origin whose power through all the unbounded symmetry of things like rays effulging from the parent sun this endless mixture of her charms diffused mind mind alone bear witness earth and heaven the living fountains in itself contains of beauteous and sublime here hand in hand sit paramount the graces here enthroned celestial venus with divinest airs invites the soul to neverfading joy looks then abroad through nature to the range of planets suns and adamantine spheres wheeling unshaken through the void immense and speak o man does this capacious scene with half that kindling majesty dilate thy strong conception as

called aloud on tullys name and shook his crimson steel and bade the father of his country hail for lo the tyrant prostrate on the dust and rome again is free  is aught so fair in all the dewy landscapes of the spring in the bright eye of hesper or the morn in natures fairest forms is aught so fair as virtuous friendship as the candid blush of him who strives with fortune to be just the graceful tear that streams for others woes or the mild majesty of private life where peace with everblooming olive crowns the gate where honors liberal hands effuse unenvied treasures and the snowy wings of innocence and love protect the scene once more search undismayed the dark profound where nature works in secret view the beds of minral treasure and the eternal vault that bounds the hoary ocean trace the forms of atoms moving with incessant change their elemental round behold the seeds of being and the energy of life kindling the mass with everactive flame then to the secrets of the working mind attentive turn from dim oblivion call her fleet ideal band and bid them go break through times barrier and overtake the hour that saw the heavens created then declare if aught were found in those external scenes to move thy wonder now for what are all the forms which brute unconscious matter wears greatness of bulk or symmetry of parts not reaching to the heart soon feeble grows the superficial impulse dull their charms and satiate soon and pall the languid eye not so the moral species or the powers of genius and design the ambitious mind there sees herself by these congenial forms touched and awakened with intenser act she bends each nerve and meditates wellpleased her features in the mirror for of all the inhabitants of earth to man alone creative wisdom gave to lift his eye to truths eternal measures thence to frame the sacred laws of action and of will discerning justice from unequal deeds and temperance from folly but beyond this energy of truth whose dictates bind

faint how slow the dawn of beauty and of truth breaks the reluctant shades of gothic night which yet involve the nations long they groaned beneath the furies of rapacious force often as the gloomy north with ironswarms tempestuous pouring from her frozen caves blasted the italian shore and swept the works of liberty and wisdom down the gulf of alldevouring night as long immured in noontide darkness by the glimmering lamp each muse and each fair science pined away the sordid hours while foul barbarian hands their mysteries profaned unstrung the lyre and chained the soaring pinion down to earth at last the muses rose and spurned their bonds at last the muses rose etc about the age of hugh capet the founder of the third race of french kings the poets of provence were in high reputation a sort of stroling bards or rhapsodists who went about the courts of princes and noblemen entertaining them at festivals with music and poetry they attempted both the epic ode and satire and abounded in a wild and fantastic vein of fable partly allegorical and partly founded on traditionary legends of the saracen wars these were the rudiments of the italian poetry but their taste and composition must have been extremely barbarous as we may judge by those who followed the turn of their fable in much politer times such as boiardo bernardo tasso ariosto etc    and wildly warbling scattered as they flew their blooming wreaths from fair valclusas valclusa the famous retreat of francesco petrarcha the father of italian poetry and his mistress laura a lady of avignon   bowers to arnos arno the

abominable politics of its little princes about the the fifteenth century these at last in conjunction with the papal power entirely extinguished the spirit of liberty in that country and established that abuse of the fine arts which has since been propagated over all europe    from public aims and from the busy walk of civil commerce drove the bolder train of penetrating science to the cells where studious ease consumes the silent hour in shadowy searches and unfruitful care thus from their guardians torn the tender arts thus from their guardians torn the tender arts etc nor were they only losers by the separation for philosophy itself to use the words of a noble philosopher being thus severed from the sprightly arts and sciences must consequently grow dronish insipid pedantic useless and directly opposite to the real knowledge and practice of the world insomuch that a gentleman says another excellent writer cannot easily bring himself to like so austere and ungainly a form so greatly is it changed from what was once the delight of the finest gentlemen of antiquity and their recreation after the hurry of public affairs from this condition it cannot be recovered but by uniting it once more with the works of imagination and we have had the pleasure of observing a very great progress made toward their union in england within these few years it is hardly possible to conceive them at a greater distance from each other than at the revolution when lock stood at the head of one party and dryden of the other but the general spirit of liberty which has ever since been growing naturally invited our men of wit and genius to improve that influence which the arts of persuasion give them with the people by applying them to subjects of importance to society thus poetry and eloquence became considerable and philosophy is now of course obliged to borrow of their imbellishments in order even to gain audience with the public    of mimic fancy and harmonious joy to priestly domination and the lust of lawless courts their amiable toil for three inglorious ages have resigned in vain reluctant and torquatos tongue was tuned for slavish paeans at the throne of tinsel pomp and raphaels magic hand effusd its fair creation to inchant the fond adoring herd in latian fanes to bind belief while on their prostrate necks the sable tyrant plants his heel secure but now behold the radiant era dawns when freedoms ample fabric fixed at length for endless years on albions happy shore in full proportion once more shall extend to all the kindred powers of social bliss a common mansion a parental roof there shall the virtues there shall wisdoms train their longlost friends rejoining as of old embrace the smiling family of arts the muses and the graces then no more shall vice distracting their delicious gifts to aims abhorred with high distaste and scorn turn from their charms the philosophic eye the patriotbosom then no more the paths of public care or intellectual toil alone by footsteps haughty and severe in gloomy state be trod the harmonious muse and her persuasive sisters then shall plant their sheltring laurels over the bleak ascent and shed their flowers along the rugged way armed with the lyre already have we dared to pierce divine philosophys retreats and teach the muse her lore already strove their longdivided honors to unite while tempring this deep argument we sang of truth and beauty now the same task impends now urging our ambitious toil we hasten to recount the various springs of adventitious pleasure which adjoin their grateful influence to the prime effect of objects grand or beauteous and enlarge the complicated joy the sweets of sense do they not often with kind accession flow to raise harmonious fancys native charm so while we taste the fragrance of the rose glows not her blush the fairer while we view amid the noontide walk a limpid rill gush through the trickling herbage to the thirst of summer yielding the delicious draught of cool refreshment over the mossy brink shines not the surface clearer and the waves with sweeter music murmur as they flow nor this alone the various lot of life often from external circumstance assumes a moments disposition to rejoice in those delights which at a different hour would pass unheeded fair the face of spring when rural songs and odours wake the morn to every eye but how much more to his round whom the bed of sickness long diffused its melancholy gloom how doubly fair when first with freshborn vigor he inhales the balmy breeze and feels the blessed sun warm at his bosom from the springs of life chasing oppressive damps and languid pain or shall i mention where celestial truth her awful light discloses to effuse a more majestic pomp on beautys frame for man loves knowledge and the beams of truth more welcome touch his understandings eye than all the blandishments of sound his ear than all of taste his tongue nor ever yet the melting rainbows vernaltincturd hues to me have shone so pleasing as when first the hand of science pointed out the path in which the sunbeams gleaming from the west fall on the watery cloud whose darksome veil involves the orient and that trickling shower piercing through every crystalline unequal of clustring dewdrops to their flight opposed recoil at length where concave all behind the internal surface of each glassy orb repells their forward passage into air that thence direct they seek the radiant goal from which their course began and as they strike in different lines the gazers obvious eye assume a different luster through the bread of colors changing from the splendid rose to the pale violets dejected hue or shall we touch that kind access of joy that springs to each fair object while we trace through all its fabric wisdoms artful aim disposing every part and gaining still by means proportioned her benignant end speak ye the pure delight whose favored steps the lamp of science through the jealous maze of nature guides when happily you reveal her secret honors whether in the sky the beauteous laws of light the central powers that wheel the pensile planets round the year whether in wonders of the rolling deep or smiling fruits of pleasurepregnant earth or fineadjusted springs of life and sense you scan the counsels of their authors hand what when to raise the meditated scene the flame of passion through the struggling soul deepkindled shows across that sudden blaze the object of its rapture vast of size with fiercer colors and a night of shade what like a storm from their capacious bed the sounding seas oerwhelming when the might of these eruptions working from the depth of mans strong apprehension shakes his frame even to the base from every naked sense of pain or pleasure dissipating all opinions feeble covrings and the veil spun from the cobwebfashion of the times to hide the feeling heart then nature speaks her genuine language and the words of men big with the very motion of their souls declare with what accumulated force the impetuous nerve of passion urges on the native weight and energy of things yet more her honors where nor beauty claims nor shows of good the thirsty sense allure from passions power alone our nature holds from passions power alone etc this very mysterious kind of pleasure which is often found in the exercise of passions generally counted painful has been taken taken notice of by several authors lucretius resolves it into selflove suave mari magno etc lib ii   as if a man was never pleased in being moved at the distress of a tragedy without a cool reflection that though these fictitious personages were so unhappy yet he himself was perfectly at ease and in safety the ingenious and candid author of the reflections critiques sur la poesy and sur la peinture accounts for it by the general delight which the mind takes in its own activity and the abhorrence it feels of an indolent and unattentive state and this joined with the moral applause of its own temper which attends these emotions when natural and just is certainly the true foundation of the pleasure which as it is the origin and basis of tragedy and epic deserved a very particular consideration in this poem    essential pleasure passions fierce illapse rouzes the minds whole fabric with supplies of daily impulse keeps the elastic powers intensely poised and polishes anew by that collision all the fine machine else rust would rise and foulness by degrees incumbring choke at last what heaven designed for ceaseless motion and a round of toil  but say does every passion men endure thus minister delight that name indeed becomes the rosy breath of love becomes the radiant smiles of joy the applauding hand of admiration but the bitter shower that sorrow sheds upon a brothers grave but the dumb palsy of nocturnal fear or those consuming fires that gnaw the heart of panting indignation find we there to move delight  then listen while my tongue the unaltered will of heaven with faithful awe reveals what old harmodious wont to teach my early age harmodius who had weighed within his learned mind whatever the schools of wisdom or thy lonelywhispring voice o faithful nature dictate of the laws which govern and support this mighty frame of universal being often the hours from morn to eve have stole unmarked away while mute attention hung upon his lips as thus the sage his awful tale began twas in the windings of an ancient wood when spotless youth with solitude resigns to sweet philosophy the studious day what time pale autumn shades the silent eve musing i roved of good and evil much and much of mortal man my thought revolved when starting full on fancys gushing eye the mournful image of parthenias fate that hour o long beloved and long deplored when blooming youth nor gentlest wisdoms arts nor hymens honors gathered for thy brow nor all thy lovers all thy fathers tears availed to snatch thee from the cruel grave thy agonizing looks thy last farewell struck to the inmost feeling of my soul as with the hand death at once the shade more horrid nodded over me and the winds with hoarser murmuring shook the branches dark as midnight storms the scene of human things appeared before me deserts burning sands where the parched adder dies the frozen south and desolation blasting all the west with rapine and with murder tyrantpowr here sits enthroned in blood the baleful charms of superstition there infect the skies and turn the sun to horror gracious heaven what is the life of man or cannot these not these portents thy awful will suffice that propagated thus beyond their scope they rise to act their cruelties anew in my afflicted bosom thus decreed the universal sensitive of pain the wretched heir of evils not its own thus i impatient when at once effusd a flashing torrent of celestial day burst through the shadowy void with slow descent a purple cloud came floating through the sky and poised at length within the circling trees hung obvious to my view till opening wide its lucid orb a more than human form emerging leaned majestic over my head and instant thunder shook the conscious grove then melted into air the liquid cloud and all the shining vision stood revealed a wreath of palm his ample forehead bound and over his shoulder mantling to his knee flowed the transparent robe around his waist collected with a radiant zone of gold ethereal there in mystic signs ingravd i read his office high and sacred name genius of human kind appalled i gazed the godlike presence for athwart his brow displeasure tempered with a mild concern looked down reluctant on me and his words like distant thunders broke the murmuring air vain are thy thoughts o child of mortal birth and impotent thy tongue is thy short span capacious of this universal frame thy wisdom allsufficient thou alas do thou aspire to judge between the lord of nature and his works to lift thy voice against the sovereign order he decreed all good and lovely to blaspheme the bands of tenderness innate and social love holiest of things by which the general orb of being as with adamantine links was drawn to perfect union and sustained from everlasting have thou felt the pangs of softening sorrow of indignant zeal so grievous to the soul as thence to wish the ties of nature broken from thy frame that so thy selfish unrelenting heart may cease to mourn its lot no longer then the wretched heir of evils not its own o fair benevolence of generous minds o man by nature formed for all mankind he spoke abashed and silent i remained as conscious of my lips offense and awed before his presence though my secret soul disdained the imputation on the ground i fixed my eyes till from his airy couch he stooped sublime and touching with his hand my dazzled forehead raise thy sight he cried and let thy sense convince thy erring tongue i looked and lo the former scene was changed for verdant alleys and surrounding trees a solitary prospect wide and wild rushed on my senses twas a horrid pile of hills with many a shaggy forest mixed with many a sable cliff and glittering stream aloft recumbent over the hanging ridge the brown woods waved while evertrickling springs washed from the naked roots of oak and pine the crumbling soil and still at every fall down the steep windings of the channeld rock remurmring rushed the congregated floods with hoarser inundation till at last they reached a grassy plain which from the skirts of that high desert spread her verdant lap and drank the gushing moisture where confined in one smooth current over the lilied vale clearer than glass it flowed autumnal spoils luxuriant spreading to the rays of morn blushed over the cliffs whose halfincircling mound as in a sylvan theater enclosed that flowery level on the rivers brink i spied a fair pavilion which diffused its floating umbrage mid the silver shade of osiers now the western sun revealed between two parting cliffs his golden orb and poured across the shadow of the hills on rocks and floods a yellow stream of light that cheered the solemn scene my listening powers were awed and every thought in silence hung and wondering expectation then the voice of that celestial power the mystic show declaring thus my deep attention called inhabitant of earth to whom is given inhabitant of earth etc the account of the economy of providence here introduced as the most proper to calm and satisfy the mind when under the compunction of private evils seems to have come originally from the pythagorean school but of all the ancient philosophers plato has most largely insisted upon it has established it with all the strength of his capacious understanding and ennobled it with all the magnificence of his divine imagination he has one passage so full and clear on the head that i am persuaded the reader will be pleased to see it here though somewhat long addressing himself to such as are not satisfied concerning divine providence the being who presides over the whole says he has disposed and complicated all things for the happiness and virtue of the whole every part of which according to the extent of its influence does and suffers what is fit and proper one of these parts is yours o unhappy man which though in itself most inconsiderable and minute yet being connected with the universe ever seeks to cooperate with that supreme order you in the mean time are ignorant of the very end for which all particular natures are brought into existence that the allcomprehending nature of the whole may be perfect and happy existing as it does not for your sake but the cause and reason of your existence which as in the symmetry of every artificial work must of necessity concur with the general design of the artist and be subservient to the whole of which it is a part your complaint therefore is ignorant and groundless since according to the various energy of creation and the common laws of nature there is a constant provision of that which is best at the same time for you and for the whole  for the governing intelligence clearly beholding all the actions of animated and selfmoving creatures and that mixture of good and evil which diversifies them considering first of all by what disposition of things and what situation of each individual in the general system vice might be depressed and subdued and virtue made secure of victory and happiness with the greatest facility and in the highest degree possible in this manner he ordered through the entire circle of being the internal constitution of every mind where should be its station in the universal fabric and through what variety of circumstances it should proceed in the whole tenor of its existence he goes on in his sublime manner to assert a future state of retribution as well for those who by the exercise of good dispositions being harmonized and assimilated to the divine virtue are consequently removed to a place of unblemished sanctity and happiness as of those who by the most flagitious arts have arisen from contemptible beginnings to the greatest affluence and power and whom therefore you look upon as unanswerable instances of negligence in the gods because you are ignorant of the purposes to which they are subservient and in what manner they contribute to that supreme intention of good to the whole plato de leg x     this theory has been delivered of late especially abroad in a manner which subverts the freedom of human actions whereas plato appears very careful to preserve it and has been in that respect imitated by the best of his followers    the gracious ways of providence to learn receive my sayings with a steadfast ear  know then the sovereign spirit of the world though selfcollected from eternal time within his own deep essence he beheld the circling bounds of happiness unite yet by immense benignity inclined to spread around him that primaeval joy which filled himself he raised his plastic arm and sounded through the hollow depth of space the strong creative mandate strait arose these heavenly orbs the glad abodes of life effusive kindled by his breath divine through endless forms of being each inhald from him its portion of the vital flame in measure such that from the wide complex of coexistent orders one might rise one order allinvolving and entire  one might rise one order etc see the meditations of antoninus and the characteristics passim    he too beholding in the sacred light of his essential reason all the shapes of swift contingence all successives ties of action propagated through the sum of possible existence he at once down the long series of eventful time so fixed the dates of being so disposed to every living soul of every kind the field of motion and the hour of rest that all conspired to his supreme design to universal good with full accord answring the mighty model he had chose the best and fairest of unnumberd worlds the best and fairest etc this opinion is so old that timaeus locrus calls the supreme being  the artificer of that which is best and represents him as resolving in the beginning to produce the most excellent work and as copying the world most exactly from his own intelligible and essential idea so that it yet remains as it was at first perfect in beauty and will never stand in need of any correction or improvement there is no room for a cauiton here to understand these expressions not of any particular circumstances of human life separately considered but of the sum or universal system of life and being see also the vision at the end of the theodicee of leibnitz    that lay from everlasting in the store of his divine conceptions nor content by one exertion of creating power his goodness to reveal through every age through every moment up the tract of time his parenthand with evernew increase of happiness and virtue has adorned the vast harmonious frame his parenthand from mute shellfish gasping on the shore to men to angels to celestial minds for ever leads the generations on to higher scenes of being while supplied from day to day by his enlivening breath inferior orders in succession rise to fill the void below as flame ascends as flame ascends etc  this opinion though not held by plato or any of the ancients is yet a very natural consequence of his principles but the disquisition is too complex and extensive to be entered upon here    as bodies to their proper center move as the poised ocean to the attracting moon obedient swells and every headlong stream devolves its winding waters to the main so all things which have life aspire to god the sun of being boundless unimpaird center of souls nor does the faithful voice of nature cease to prompt their eager steps aright nor is the care of heaven witheld from granting to the task proportioned aid that in their stations all may persevere to climb the ascent of being and approach for ever nearer to the life divine that rocky pile thou see that verdant lawn freshwaterd from the mountains let the scene paint in thy fancy the primaeval seat of man and where the will supreme ordained his mansion that pavilion fairdiffusd along the shady brink in this recess to wear the appointed season of his youth till riper hours should open to his toil the high communion of superior minds of consecrated heroes and of gods nor did the sire omnipotent forget his tender bloom to cherish nor witheld celestial footsteps from his green abode often from the radiant honors of his throne he sent whom most he loved the sovereign fair the effluence of his glory whom he placed before his eyes for ever to behold the goddess from whose inspiration flows the toil of patriots the delight of friends without whose work divine in heaven or earth naught lovely naught propitious comes to pass nor hope nor praise nor honor her the sire gave it in charge to rear the blooming mind the folded powers to open to direct the growth luxuriant of his young desires and from the laws of this majestic world to teach him what was good as thus the nymph her daily care attended by her side with constant steps her gay companion stayed the fair euphrosyne the gentle queen of smiles and graceful gladness and delights that cheer alike the hearts of mortal men and powers immortal see the shining pair behold where from his dwelling now disclosed they quit their youthful charge and seek the skies i looked and on the flowery turf there stood between two radiant forms a smiling youth whose tender cheeks displayed the vernal flower of beauty sweetest innocence illumd his bashful eyes and on his polished brow sat young simplicity with fond regard he viewed the associates as their steps they moved the younger chief his ardent eyes detained with mild regret invoking her return bright as the star of evening she appeared amid the dusky scene eternal youth over all her form its glowing honors breathed and smiles eternal from her candid eyes flowed like the dewy luster of the morn effusive trembling on the placid waves the spring of heaven had shed its blushing spoils to bind her sable tresses full diffused her yellow mantle floated in the breeze and in her hand she waved a living branch rich with immortal fruits of power to calm the wrathful heart and from the brightning eyes to chase the cloud of sadness more sublime the heavenly partner moved the prime of age composed her steps the presence of a god high on the circle of her brow enthroned from each majestic motion darted awe devoted awe till cherished by her looks benevolent and meek confiding love to filial rapture softened all the soul free in her graceful hand she poised the sword of chaste dominion an heroic crown displayed the old simplicity of pomp around her honored head a matrons robe white as the sunshine streams through vernal clouds her stately form invested hand in hand the immortal pair forsook the enameled green ascending slowly rays of limpid light gleamd round their path celestial sounds were heard and through the fragrant air ethereal dews distilled around them till at once the clouds disparting wide in midway sky withdrew their airy veil and left a bright expanse of empyrean flame where spent and drowned afflicted vision plunged in vain to scan what object it involved my feeble eyes endured not bending down to earth i stood with dumb attention soon a female voice as watery murmurs sweet or warbling shades with sacred invocation thus began father of gods and mortals whose right arm with reins eternal guides the moving heavens bend thy propitious ear behold wellpleased i seek to finish thy divine decree with frequent steps i visit yonder seat of man thy offspring from the tender seeds of justice and of wisdom to evolve the latent honors of his generous frame till thy conducting hand shall raise his lot from earths dim scene to these ethereal walks the temple of thy glory but not me not my directing voice he often requires or hears delighted this enchanting maid the associate thou have given me her alone he loves o father absent her he craves and but for her glad presence ever joined rejoices not in mine that all my hopes this thy benignant purpose to fulfill i deem uncertain and my daily cares unfruitful all and vain unless by thee still farther aided in the work divine she ceased a voice more awful thus replied o thou in whom for ever i delight fairer than all the inhabitants of heaven best image of thy author far from thee be disappointment or distaste or blame who soon or late shall every work fulfill and no resistance find is man refuse to hearken to thy dictates or allured by meaner joys to any other power transfer the honors due to thee alone that joy which he pursues he never shall taste that power in whom delights never behold go then once more and happy be thy toil go then but let not this thy smiling friend partake thy footsteps in her stead behold with thee the son of nemesis i send the fiend abhorred whose vengeance takes account of sacred orders violated laws see where he calls thee burning to be gone fierce to exhaust the tempest of his wrath on yon devoted head but thou my child control his cruel frenzy and protect thy tender charge that when despair shall grasp his agonizing bosom he may learn then he may learn to love the gracious hand alone sufficient in that hour of ill to save his feeble spirit then confess thy genuine honors o excelling fair when all the plagues that wait the deadly will of this avenging demon all the storms of night infernal serve but to display the energy of thy superior charms with mildest awe triumphant over his rage and shining clearer in the horrid gloom here ceased that awful voice and soon i felt the cloudy curtain of refreshing eve was closed once more from that immortal fire sheltering my eyelids looking up i viewed a vast gigantic spectre striding on through murmuring thunders and a waste of clouds with dreadful action black as night his brow relentless frowns involved his savage limbs with sharp impatience violent he writhed as through convulsive anguish and his hand armed with a scorpionlash full often he raised in madness to his bosom while his eyes rained bitter tears and bellowing loud he shook the void with horror silent by his side the virgin came no discomposure stirred her features from the glooms which hung around no stain of darkness mingled with the beam of her divine effulgence now they stoop upon the riverbank and now to hail his wonted guests with eager steps advanced the unsuspecting inmate of the shade as when a famished wolf that all night long had ranged the alpine snows by chance at morn sees from a cliff incumbent over the smoke of some lone village a neglected kid that strays along the wild for herb or spring down from the winding ridge he sweeps amain and thinks he tears him so with tenfold rage the monster sprung remorseless on his prey amazed the stripling stood with panting breast feebly he poured the lamentable wail of helpless consternation struck at once and rooted to the ground the queen beheld his terror and with looks of tenderest care advanced to save him soon the tyrant felt her awful power his keen tempestuous arm hung nerveless nor descended where his rage had aimed the deadly blow then dumb retired with sullen rancour lo the sovereign maid folds with a mothers arms the fainting boy till life rekindles in his rosy cheek then grasps his hand and chears him with her tongue o wake thee rouse thy spirit shall the spite of yon tormentor thus appall thy heart while i thy friend and guardian am at hand to rescue and to heal o let thy soul remember what the will of heaven ordains is ever good for all and if for all then good for thee nor only by the warmth and soothing sunshine of delightful things do minds grow up and flourish often misled by that blind light the young unpracticed views of reason wander through a fatal road far from their native aim as if to lie inglorious in the fragrant shade and wait the soft access of evercircling joys were all the end of being ask thyself this pleasing error did it never lull thy wishes has thy constant heart refused the silken fetters of delicious ease or when divine euphrosyne appeared within this dwelling did not thy desires hang far below that measure of thy fate which i revealed before thee and thy eyes impatient of my counsels turn away to drink the soft effusion of her smiles know then for this the everlasting ire deprives thee of her presence and instead o wise and still benevolent ordains this horrid visage hither to pursue my steps that so thy nature may discern its real good and what alone can save thy feeble spirit in this hour of ill from folly and despair o yet beloved let not this headlong terror quite overwhelm thy scattered powers nor fatal deem the rage of this tormentor nor his proud assault while i am here to vindicate thy toil above the generous question of thy arm brave by thy fears and in thy weakness strong this hour he triumphs but confront his might and dare him to the combat then with ease disarmed and quelled his fierceness he resigns to bondage and to scorn while thus inured by watchful danger by unceasing toil the immortal mind superior to his fate amid the outrage of external things firm as the solid base of this great world rests on his own foundations blow ye winds ye waves ye thunders roll your tempest on shake ye old pillars of the marble sky till all its orbs and all its worlds of fire be loosened from their seats yet still serene the unconquered mind looks down upon the wreck and ever stronger as the storms advance firm through the closing ruin holds his way where nature calls him to the destined goal so spoke the goddess while through all her frame celestial raptures flowed in every word in every motion kindling wrath divine to seize who listened vehement and swift as lightning fires the aromatic shade in ethiopian fields the stripling felt her inspiration catch his fervid soul and starting from his languor thus exclaimed then let the trial come and witness thou if terror be upon me if i shrink to meet the storm or faulter in my strength when hardest it besets me do not think that i am fearful and infirm of soul as late thy eyes beheld for thou have changed my nature thy commanding voice has waked my languid powers to bear me boldly on wherever the will divine my path ordains through toil or peril only do not thou forsake me o be thou for ever near that i may listen to thy sacred voice and guide by thy decrees my constant feet but say for ever are my eyes bereft say shall the fair euphrosyne not once appear again to charm me thou in heaven o thou eternal arbiter of things be thy great bidding done for who am i to question thy appointment let the frowns of this avenger every morn overcast the cheerful dawn and every evening damp with double night my dwelling i will learn to hail them both and unrepining bear his hateful presence but permit my tongue one glad request and if my deeds may find thy awful eye propitious o restore the rosyfeaturd maid again to cheer this lonely seat and bless me with her smiles he spoke when instant through the sable glooms with which that furious presence had involved the ambient air a flood of radiance came swift as the lightningflash the melting clouds flew diverse and amid the blue serene euphrosyne appeared with sprightly step the nymph alighted on the irriguous lawn and to her wondering audience thus begun lo i am here to answer to your vows and be the meeting fortunate i come with joyful tidings we shall part no more  hark how the gentle echo from her cell talks through the cliffs and murmuring over the stream repeats the accent we shall part no more o my delightful friends wellpleased on high the father has beheld you while the might of that stern foe with bitter trial proved your equal doings then for ever spoke the high decree that thou celestial maid however that griesly phantom on thy steps may sometimes dare intrude yet never more shall thou descending to the abode of man alone endure the rancour of his arm or leave thy loved euphrosyne behind she ended and the whole romantic scene immediate vanished rocks and woods and rills the mantling tent and each mysterious form flew like the pictures of a morning dream when sunshine fills the bed a while i stood perplexed and giddy till the radiant power who bade the visionary landscape rise as up to him i turned with gentlest looks preventing my inquiry thus began there let thy soul acknowledge its complaint how blind how impious there behold the ways of heavens eternal destiny to man for ever just benevolent and wise that virtues awful steps however pursued by vexing fortune and intrusive pain should never be divided from her chaste her fair attendant pleasure need i urge thy tardy thought through all the various round of this existence that thy softening soul at length may learn what energy the hand of virtue mingles in the bitter tide of passion swelling with distress and pain to mitigate the sharp with gracious drops of cordial pleasure ask the faithful youth why the cold urn of her whom long he loved so often fills his arms so often draws his lonely footsteps at the silent hour to pay the mournful tribute of his tears o he will tell thee that the wealth of worlds should never seduce his bosom to forego that sacred hour when stealing from the noise of care and envy sweet remembrance sooths with virtues kindest looks his aching breast and turns his tears to rapture  ask the crowd which flies impatient from the villagewalk to climb the neighboring cliffs when far below

so close what wonder if to search this common nature through the various change of sex and age and fortune and the frame of each peculiar draw the busy mind with unresisted charms the spacious west and all the teeming regions of the south hold not a quarry to the curious flight of knowledge half so tempting or so fair as man to man nor only where the smiles of love invite nor only where the applause of cordial honor turns the attentive eye on virtues graceful deeds for since the course of things external acts in different ways on human apprehensions as the hand of nature tempered to a different frame peculiar minds so happily where the powers of fancy neither lessen nor enlarge  where the powers of fancy etc the influence of the imagination on the conduct of life is one of the most important points in moral philosophy it were easy by an induction of facts to prove that the imagination directs almost all the passions and mixes with almost every circumstance of action or pleasure let any man even of the coldest head and soberest industry analyze the idea of what he calls his interest he will find that it consists chiefly of certain images of decency beauty and order variously combined into one system the idol which he seeks to enjoy by labor hazard and selfdenial it is on this account of the last consequence to regulate these images by the standard of nature and the general good otherwise the imagination by heightening some objects beyond their real excellence and beauty or by representing others in a more odious or terrible shape than they deserve may of course engage us in pursuits utterly inconsistent with the laws of the moral order  if it be objected that this account of things supposes the passions to be merely accidental whereas there appears in some a natural and hereditary disposition to certain passions prior to all circumstances of education or fortune it may be answered that though no man is born ambitious or a miser yet he may inherit from his parents a peculiar temper or complexion of mind which shall render his imagination more liable to be struck with some particular objects consequently dispose him to form opinions of good and ill and entertain passions of a particular turn some men for instance by the original frame of their minds are more delighted with the vast and magnificent others on the contrary with the elegant and gentle aspects of nature and it is very remarkable that the disposition of the moral powers is always similar to this of the imagination that those who are most inclined to admire prodigious and sublime objects in the physical world are also most inclined to applaud examples of fortitude and heroic virtue in the moral while those who are charmed rather with the delicacy and sweetness of colors and forms and sounds never fail in like manner to yield the preference to the softer scenes of virtue and the sympathies of a domestic life and this is sufficient to account for the objection  among the ancient philosophers though we have several hints concerning this influence of the imagination upon morals among the remains of the socratic school yet the stoics were the first who paid it a due attention zeno their founder thought it impossible to preserve any tolerable regularity in life without frequently inspecting those pictures or appearances of things which the imagination offers to the mind  diog laert l vii the meditations of m aurelius and the discourses of epictetus are full of the same sentiments insomuch that this latter makes the  or right management of the fancys the only thing for which we are accountable to providence and without which a man is no other than stupid or frantic arrian l i c    and l ii c    see also the characteristics vol   from p     to p     where this stoical doctrine is embellished with all the eloquence and graces of plato    the images of things but paint in all their genuine hues the features which they wore in nature there opinion will be true and action right for action treads the path in which opinion says he follows good or flies from evil and opinion gives report of good or evil as the scene was drawn by fancy lovely or deformed thus her report can never there be true where fancy cheats the intellectual eye with glaring colors and distorted lines is there a man who at the sound of death sees ghastly shapes of terror conjured up and black before him naught but deathbed groans and fearful prayers and plunging from the brink of light and being down the gloomy air an unknown depth alas in such a mind if no bright forms of excellence attend the image of his country nor the pomp of sacred senates nor the guardian voice of justice on her throne nor aught that wakes the conscious bosom with a patriots flame will not opinion tell him that to die or stand the hazard is a greater ill than to betray his country and in act will he not choose to be a wretch and live here vice begins then from the enchanting cup which fancy holds to all the unwary thirst of youth often swallows a circaean draught that sheds a baleful tincture over the eye of reason till no longer he discerns and only guides to err then revel forth a furious band that spurn him from the throne and all is uproar thus ambition grasps the empire of the soul thus pale revenge unsheaths her murderous dagger and the hands of lust and rapine with unholy arts watch to oerturn the barrier of the laws that keeps them from their prey thus all the plagues the wicked bear or over the trembling scene the tragic muse discloses under shapes of honor safety pleasure ease or pomp stole first into the mind yet not by all those lying forms which fancy in the brain engenders are the kindling passions driven to guilty deeds nor reason bound in chains that vice alone may lord it often adorned with solemn pageants folly mounts his throne and plays her ideotanticks like a queen a thousand garbs she wears a thousand ways she wheels her giddy empire  lo thus far with bold adventure to the mantuan lyre i sing of natures charms and touch wellpleased a stricter note now happily must my song unbend her serious measure and reveal in lighter strains how follys awkward arts  how follys awkward arts etc notwithstanding the general influence of ridicule on private and civil life as well as on learning and the sciences it has been almost constantly neglected or misrepresented by divines especially the manner of treating these subjects in the science of human nature should be precisely the same as in natural philosophy from particular facts to investigate the stated order in which they appear and then apply the general law thus discovered to the explication of other appearances and the improvement of useful arts    excite impetuous laughters gay rebuke the sportive province of the comic muse see in what crowds the uncouth forms advance each would outstrip the other each prevent our careful search and offer to your gaze unasked his motley features wait awhile my curious friends and let us first arrange in proper orders your promiscuous throng behold the foremost band of slender thought behold the foremost band etc  the first and most general source of ridicule in the characters of men is vanity or selfapplause for some desirable quality or possession which evidently does not belong to those who assume it    and easy faith whom flattering fancy sooths with lying specter in themselves to view illustrious forms of excellence and good that scorn the mansion with exulting hearts they spread their spurious treasures to the sun and bid the world admire but chief the glance of wishful envy draws their joybright eyes and lists with selfapplause each lordly brow in number boundless as the blooms of spring behold their glaring idols empty shades by fancy gilded over and then set up for adoration some in learnings garb with formal band and sablecincturd gown and rags of moldy volumes some elate with martial splendor steely pikes and swords of costly frame and gay phoenician robes inwrought with flowring gold assume the port of stately valor listening by his side there stands a female form to her with looks of earnest import pregnant with amaze he talks of deadly deeds of breaches storms and sulfurous mines and ambush then at once breaks off and smiles to see her look so pale and asks some wondering question of her fears others of graver mien behold adorned with holy ensigns how sublime they move and bending often their sanctimonious eyes take homage of the simpleminded throng ambassadors of heaven nor much unlike is he whose visage in the lazy mist that mantles every feature hides a brood of politic conceits of whispers nods and hints deepomend with unwieldy schemes and dark portents of state ten thousand more prodigious habits and tumultuous tongues pour dauntless in and swell the boastful band then comes the second order all who seek then comes the second order etc  ridicule from the same vanity where though the possession be real yet no merit can arise from it because of some particular circumstances which though obvious to the spectator are yet overlooked by the ridiculous character    the debt of praise where watchful unbelief darts through the thin pretense her squinting eye on some retired appearance which belies the boasted virtue or annulls the applause that justice else would pay here side by side i see two leaders of the solemn train approaching one a female old and gray with eyes demure and wrinklefurrowd brow pale as the cheeks of death yet still she stuns the sickning audience with a nauseous tale how many youths her myrtle chains have worn how many virgins at her triumphs pined yet how resolved she guards her cautious heart such is her terror at the risques of love and mans seducing tongue the other seems a bearded sage ungentle in his mien and sordid all his habit peevish want grins at his heels while down the gazing throng he stalks resounding in magnific phrase the vanity of riches the contempt of pomp and power be prudent in your zeal ye grave associates let the silent grace of her who blushes at the fond regard her charms inspire more eloquent unfold the praise of spotless honor let the man whose eye regards not his illustrious pomp and ample store but as indulgent streams to cheer the barren soil and spread the fruits of joy let him by juster measure fix the price of riches and the end of power another tribe succeeds deluded long another tribe succeeds etc  ridicule from a notion of excellence in particular objects disproportioned to their intrinsic value and inconsistent with the order of nature    by fancys dazzling optics these behold the images of some peculiar things with brighter hues resplendent and portrayd with features nobler far than ever adorned their genuine objects hence the feverd heart pants with delirious hope for tinsel charms hence often obtrusive on the eye of scorn untimely zeal her witless pride betrays and serious manhood from the towering aim of wisdom stoops to emulate the boast of childish toil behold yon mystic form bedecked with feathers insects weeds and shells not with intenser brow the samian sage bent his fixed eye on heavens eternal fires when first the order of that radiant scene swelled his exulting thought than this surveys a muckworms entrails or a spiders fang next him a youth with flowers and myrtles crowned attends that virgin form and blushing kneels with fondest gesture and a suppliants tongue to win her coy regard adieu for him the dull engagements of the bustling world adieu the sick impertinence of praise and hope and action for with her alone by streams and shades to steal the sighing hours is all he asks and all that fate can give thee too facetious momion wandering here thee dreaded censor often have i beheld bewildered unawares alas too long flushed with thy comic triumphs and the spoils of sly derision till on every side hurling thy random bolts offended truth assigned thee here thy station with the slaves of folly thy once formidable name shall grace her humble records and be heard in scoffs and mockry bandied from the lips of all the vengeful brotherhood around so often the patient victims of thy scorn but now ye gay to whom indulgent fate but now ye gay etc  ridicule from a notion of excellence where the object is absolutely odious or contemptible this is the highest degree of the ridiculous as in the affectation of diseases or vices    of all the muses empire has assigned the fields of folly hither each advance your sickles here the teeming soil affords its richest growth a favorite brood appears in whom the demon with a mothers joy views all her charms reflected all her cares at full repaid ye most illustrious band who scorning reasons tame pedantic rules and orders vulgar bondage never meant for souls sublime as yours with generous zeal pay vice the reverence virtue long usurped and yield deformity the fond applause which beauty wont to claim forgive my song that for the blushing diffidence of youth it shuns the unequal province of your praise thus far triumphant in the pleasing guile thus far triumphant etc ridicule from false shame or groundless fear    of bland imagination follys train have dared our search but now a dastardkind advance reluctant and with faultring feet shrink from the gazers eye infeebled hearts whom fancy chills with visionary fears or bends to servile tameness with conceits of shame of evil or of base defect fantastic and delusive here the slave who droops abashed when sullen pomp surveys his humbler habit here the trembling wretch unnervd and froze with terrors icy bolts spent in weak wailings drowned in shameful tears at every dream of danger here subdued by frontless laughter and the hardy scorn of old unfeeling vice the abject soul who blushing half resigns the candid praise of temperance and honor half disowns a freemans hatred of tyrannic pride and hears with sickly smiles the venal mouth with foulest license mock the patriots name last of the motley bands on whom the power last of the etc ridicule from the ignorance of such things as our circumstances require us to know    of gay derision bends her hostile aim is that where shameful ignorance presides beneath her sordid banners lo they march like blind and lame whatever their doubtful hands attempt confusion strait appears behind and troubles all the work through many a maze perplexed they struggle changing every path oerturning every purpose then at last sit down dismayed and leave thentangled scene for scorn to sport with such then is thabode of folly in the mind and such the shapes in which she governs her obsequious train though every scene of ridicule in things to lead the tenor of my devious lay through every swift occasion which the hand of laughter points at when the mirthful sting distends her sallying nerves and choaks her tongue what were it but to count each crystal drop which mornings dewy fingers on the blooms of may distill suffice it to have said  suffice it to have said etc by comparing these general sources of ridicule with each other and examining the ridiculous in other objects we may obtain a general definition of it equally applicable to every species the most important circumstance of this definition is laid down in the lines referred to but others more minute we shall subjoin here aristotles account of the matter seems both imperfect and false  says he  the ridiculous is some certain fault or turpitude without pain and not destructive to its subject  poetic c v for allowing it to be true as it is not that the ridiculous is never accompanied with pain yet we might produce many instances of such a fault or turpitude which cannot with any tolerable propriety be called ridiculous so that the definition does not distinguish the thing defined nay farther even when we perceive the turpitude tending to the destruction of its subject we may still be sensible of a ridiculous appearance till the ruin become imminent and the keener sensations of pity or terror banish the ludicrous apprehension from our minds for the sensation of ridicule is not a bare perception of the agreement or disagreement of ideas but a passion or emotion of the mind consequential to that perception so that the mind may perceive the agreement or disagreement and yet not feel the ridiculous because it is engrossed by a more violent emotion thus it happens that some men think those objects ridiculous to which others cannot endure to apply the name because in them they excite a much intenser and more important feeling and this difference among other causes has brought a good deal of confusion into this question  that which makes objects ridiculous is some ground of admiration or esteem connected with other more general circumstances comparatively worthless or deformed or it is some circumstance of turpitude or deformity connected with what is in general excellent or beautiful the inconsistent properties existing either in the objects themselves or in the apprehension of the person to whom they relate belonging always to the same order or class of being implying sentiment or design and exciting no acute or vehement emotion of the heart  to prove the several parts of this definition the appearance of excellence or beauty connected with a general condition comparatively sordid or deformed is ridiculous for instance pompous pretensions to wisdom joined with ignorance and folly in the socrates of aristophanes and the applause of military glory with cowardice and stupidity in the thraso of terence  the appearance of deformity or turpitude in conjunction with what is in general excellent or venerable is also ridiculous for instance the personal weaknesses of a magistrate appearing in the solemn and public functions of his station  the incongruous properties may either exist in the objects themselves or in the apprehension of the person to whom they relate in the lastmentiond instances they both exist in the objects in the instance from aristophanes and terence one of them is objective and real the other only founded in the apprehension of the ridiculous character  the inconsistent properties must belong to the same order or class of being a coxcomb in fine clothes bedaubed by accident in foul weather is a ridiculous object because his general apprehension of excellence and esteem is referred to the splendor and expense of his dress a man of sense and merit in the same circumstances is not counted ridiculous because the general ground of excellence and esteem in him is both in fact and in his own apprehension of a very different species  every ridiculous object implies sentiment or design a column placed by an architect without a capital or base is laughed at the same column in a ruin causes a very different sensation  and lastly the occurrence must excite no acute or vehement emotion of the heart such as terror pity or indignation for in that case as was observed above the mind is not at leisure to contemplate the ridiculous  whether any appearance not ridiculous be involved in this description and whether it comprehend every species and form of the ridiculous must be determined by repeated applications of it to particular instances    wherever the power of ridicule displays her quainteyd visage some incongruous form some stubborn dissonance of things combined strikes on the quick observer whether pomp or praise or beauty mix their partial claim where sordid fashions where ignoble deeds where foul deformity are wont to dwell or whether these with violation loathed invade resplendent pomps imperious mien the charms of beauty or the boast of praise ask we for what fair end ask we for what fair end etc since it is beyond all contradiction evident that we have a natural sense or feeling of the ridiculous and since so good a reason may be assigned to justify the supreme being for bestowing it one cannot without astonishment reflect on the conduct of those men who imagine it is for the service of true religion to vilify and blacken it without distinction and endeavor to persuade us that it is never applied but in a bad cause ridicule is not concerned with mere speculative truth or falsehood it is not in abstract propositions or theorems but in actions and passions good and evil beauty and deformity that we find materials for it and all these terms are relative implying approbation or blame to ask then whether ridicule be a test of truth is in other words to ask whether that which is ridiculous can be morally true can be just and becoming or whether that which is just and becoming can be ridiculous a question that does not deserve a serious answer for it is most evident that as in a metaphysical proposition offered to the understanding for its assent the faculty of reason examines the terms of the proposition and finding one idea which was supposed equal to another to be in fact unequal of consequence rejects the proposition as a falsehood so in objects offered to the mind for its esteem or applause the faculty of ridicule feeling an incongruity in the claim urges the mind to reject it with laughter and contempt when therefore we observe such a claim obtruded upon mankind and the inconsistent circumstances carefully concealed from the eye of public it is our business if the matter be of importance to society to drag out those latent circumstances and by setting them full in view convince the world how ridiculous the claim is and thus a double advantage is gained for we both detect the moral falsehood sooner than in the way of speculative inquiry and impress the minds of men with a stronger sense of the vanity and error of its authors and this and no more is meant by the application of ridicule  but it is said the practice is dangerous and may be inconsistent with the regard we owe to objects of real dignity and excellence i answer the practice fairly managed can never be dangerous men may be dishonest in obtruding circumstances foreign to the object and we may be inadvertent in allowing those circumstances to impose upon us but the sense of ridicule always judges right the socrates of aristophanes is as truly ridiculous a character as ever was drawn  true but it is not the character of socrates the divine moralist and father of ancient wisdom what then did the ridicule of the poet hinder the philosopher from detecting and disclaiming those foreign circumstances which he had falsely introduced into his character and thus rendering the satirist doubly ridiculous in his turn no but it nevertheless had an ill influence on the minds of the people and so has the reasoning of spinoza made many atheists he has founded it indeed on suppositions utterly false but allow him these and his conclusions are unavoidably true and if we must reject the use of ridicule because by the imposition of false circumstances things may be made to seem ridiculous which are not so in themselves why we ought not in the same manner to reject the use of reason because by proceeding on false principles conclusions will appear true which are impossible in nature let the vehement and obstinate declaimers against ridicule determine   the almighty sire in mortal bosoms wakes this gay contempt these grateful stings of laughter from disgust educing pleasure wherefore but to aid the tardy steps of reason and at once by this prompt impulse urge us to depress the giddy aims of folly though the light of truth slowdawning on the inquiring mind at length unfolds through many a subtle tie how these uncouth disorders end at last in public evil yet benignant heaven conscious how dim the dawn of truth appears to thousands conscious what a scanty pause from labors and from care the wider lot of humble life affords for studious thought to scan the maze of nature therefore stamped the glaring scenes with characters of scorn as broad as obvious to the passing clown as to the lettered sages curious eye such are the various aspects of the mind  some heavenly genius whose unclouded thoughts attain that secret harmony which blends the ethereal spirit with its mold of clay o teach me to reveal the grateful charm that searchless nature over the sense of man diffuses to behold in lifeless things the inexpressive semblance the inexpressive semblance etc this similitude is the foundation of almost all the ornaments of poetic diction   of himself of thought and passion mark the sable woods that shade sublime yon mountains nodding brow with what religious awe the solemn scene commands your steps as if the reverend form of minos or of numa should forsake the elysian seats and down the imbowring glade move to your pausing eye behold the expanse of yon gay landscape where the silver clouds flit over the heavens before the sprightly breeze now their gray cincture skirts the doubtful sun now streams of splendour through their opening veil effulgent sweep from off the gilded lawn the aerial shadows on the curling brook and on the shady margins quivering leaves with quickest luster glancing while you view the prospect say within your cheerful breast plays not the lively sense of winning mirth with clouds and sunshine checkered while the round of social converse to the inspiring tongue of some gay nymph amid her subjecttrain moves all obsequious whence is this effect this kindred power of such discordant things or flows their semblance from that mystic tone to which the newborn minds harmonious powers at first were strung or rather from the links which artful custom twines around her frame for when the different images of things by chance combined have struck the attentive soul with deeper impulse or connected long have drawn her frequent eye however distinct the external scenes yet often the ideas gain from that conjunction an eternal tie and sympathy unbroken let the mind recall one partner of the various league immediate lo the firm confedrates rise and each his former station strait resumes one movement governs the consenting throng and all at once with rosy pleasure shine or all are saddend with the glooms of care twas thus if ancient fame the truth unfold two faithful needles from the informing touch two faithful needles etc see the elegant poem recited by cardinal bembo in the character of lucretius strada prolus vi academ   c      of the same parentstone together drew its mystic virtue and at first conspired with fatal impulse quivering to the pole then though disjoined by kingdoms though the main rolled its broad surge betwixt and different stars beheld their wakeful motions yet preserved the

fixed unerring there such is the secret union when we feel a song a flower a name at once restore those longconnected scenes where first they moved the attention backward through her mazy walks guiding the wanton fancy to her scope to temples courts or fields with all the band of painted forms of passions and designs attendant whence if pleasing in itself the prospect from that sweet accession gains redoubled influence over the listening mind by these mysterious ties the busy power by these mysterious ties etc the act of remembering seems almost wholly to depend on the association of ideas    of memory her ideal train preserves entire or when they would elude her watch reclaims their fleeting footsteps from the waste of dark oblivion thus collecting all the various forms of being to present before the curious aim of mimic art their largest choice like springs unfolded blooms exhaling sweetness that the skillful be may taste at will from their selected spoils to work her dulcet food for not the expanse of living lakes in summers noontide calm reflects the bordring shade and sunbright heavens with fairer semblance not the sculptured gold more faithful keeps the gravers lively trace than he whose birth the sisterpowrs of art propitious viewed and from his genial star shed influence to the seeds of fancy kind than his attemperd bosom must preserve the seal of nature there alone unchanged her form remains the balmy walks of may there breathe perennial sweets the trembling chord resounds for ever in the abstracted ear melodious and the virgins radiant eye superior to disease to grief and time shines with unbating luster thus at length endowed with all that nature can bestow the child of fancy often in silence bends over these mixed treasures of his pregnant breast with conscious pride from them he often resolves to frame he knows not what excelling things and win he knows not what sublime reward of praise and wonder by degrees the mind feels her young nerves dilate the plastic powers labor for action blind emotions heave his bosom and with loveliest frenzy caught from earth to heaven he rolls his daring eye from heaven to earth anon ten thousand shapes like specter trooping to the wisards call fleet swift before him from the womb of earth from oceans bed they come the eternal heavens disclose their splendors and the dark abyss pours out her births unknown with fixed gaze he marks the rising phantoms now compares their different forms now blends them now divides inlarges and extenuates by turns opposes ranges in fantastic bands and infinitely varies hither now now thither fluctuates his inconstant aim with endless choice perplexed at length his plan begins to open lucid order dawns and as from chaos old the jarring seeds of nature at the voice divine repaired each to its place till rosy earth unveiled her fragrant bosom and the joyful sun sprung up the blue serene by swift degrees thus disentangled his entire design emerges colors mingle features join and lines converge the fainter parts retire the fairer eminent in light advance and every image on its neighbor smiles a while he stands and with a fathers joy contemplates then with promethean art into its proper vehicle he breathes into its proper vehicle etc this relates to the different sorts of corporeal mediums by which the ideas of the artist are rendered palpable to the senses as by sounds in music by lines and shadows in painting by diction in poetry etc    the fair conception which imbodied thus and permanent becomes to eyes or ears an object ascertained while thus informed the various organs of his mimic skill the consonance of sounds the featured rock the shadowy picture and impassioned verse beyond their proper powers attract the soul by that expressive semblance while in sight of natures great original we scan the lively child of art while line by line and feature after feature we refer to that sublime exemplar whence it stole those animating charms thus beautys palm betwixt em wavering hangs applauding love doubts where to choose and mortal man aspires to tempt creative praise as when a cloud of gathering hail with limpid crusts of ice enclosed and obvious to the beaming sun collects his large effulgence strait the heavens with equal flames present on either hand the radiant visage persia stands at gaze appalled

might smile with scorn while raptured vision tells of the gay colored radiance flushing bright over all creation from the wise be far such gross unhallowed pride nor needs my song descend so low but rather now unfold if human thought could reach or words unfold by what mysterious fabric of the mind the deepfelt joys and harmony of sound result from airy motion and from shape the lovely phantoms of sublime and fair by what fine ties has god connected things when present in the mind which in themselves have no connection sure the rising sun over the caerulean unequal of the sea with equal brightness and with equal warmth might roll his fiery orb nor yet the soul thus feel her frame expanded and her powers exulting in the splendour she beholds like a young conquror moving through the

careless limbs to lay under the plantane shade and all the day with amorous airs my fancy entertain etc waller battle of the summerislands canto i and again while in the park i sing the listening deer attend my passion and forget to fear etc at penshurst    all on the margin of some flowery stream to spread his careless limbs amid the cool of plantane shades and to the listening deer the tale of slighted vows and loves disdain resound softwarbling all the livelong day consenting zephyr sighs the weeping rill joins in his plaint melodious mute the groves and hill and dale with all their echoes mourn such and so various are the tastes of men oh blessed of heaven whom not the languid songs of luxury the siren not the bribes of sordid wealth nor all the gaudy spoils of pageant honor can seduce to leave those everblooming sweets which from the store of nature fair imagination culls to charm the inlivend soul what though not all of mortal offspring can attain the heights of envied life though only few possess patrician treasures or imperial state yet natures care to all her children just with richer treasures and an ampler state indows at large whatever happy man will deign to use them his the citys pomp the rural honors his whatever adorns the princely dome the column and the arch the breathing marbles and the sculptured gold beyond the proud possessors narrow claim his tuneful breast injoys for him the spring distills her dews and from the silken gem its lucid leaves unfolds for him the hand of autumn tinges every fertile branch with blooming gold and blushes like the morn each passing hour sheds tribute from her wings and still new beauties meet his lonely walk and loves unfelt attract him not a breeze  not a breeze etc that this account may not appear rather poetically extravagant than just in philosophy it may be proper to produce the sentiment of one of the greatest wisest and best of men on this article one so little to be suspected of partiality in the case that he reckons it among those favors for which he was especially thankful to the gods that they had not suffered him to make any great proficiency in the arts of eloquence and poetry lest by that means he should have been diverted from pursuits of more importance to his high station speaking of the beauty of universal nature he observes that there is a pleasing and graceful aspect in every object we perceive when once we consider its connection with that general order he instances in many things which at first sight would be thought rather deformities and then adds that a man who enjoys a sensibility of temper with a just comprehension of the universal order  will discern many amiable things not credible to every mind but to those alone who have entered into an honorable familiarity with nature and her works m antonin iii      flies over the meadow not a cloud imbibes the setting suns effulgence not a strain from all the tenants of the warbling shade ascends but whence his bosom can partake fresh pleasure unreprovd nor thence partakes fresh pleasure only for the attentive mind by this harmonious action on her powers becomes herself harmonious wont so long in outward things to meditate the charm of sacred order soon she seeks at home to find a kindred order to exert within herself this elegance of love this fairinspird delight her tempered powers refine at length and every passion wears a chaster milder more attractive mien but if to ampler prospects if to gaze on natures form where negligent of all these lesser graces she assumes the port of that eternal majesty that weighed the worlds foundations if to these the mind exalt her daring eye then mightier far will be the change and nobler would the forms of servile custom cramp her generous powers would sordid policies the barbarous growth of ignorance and rapine bow her down to tame pursuits to indolence and fear lo she appeals to nature to the winds and rolling waves the suns unwearied course the elements and seasons all declare for what the eternal maker has ordained the powers of man we feel within ourselves his energy divine he tells the heart he meant he made us to behold and love what he beholds and loves the general orb of life and being to be great like him beneficent and active thus the men whom natures works can charm with god himself hold converse grow familiar day by day with his conceptions act upon his plan and form to his the relish of their souls finis january    the beginning of next month will be published in ten neat pocket volumes a select collection of fifty old plays
