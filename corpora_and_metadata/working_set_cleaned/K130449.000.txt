 answers or poor james thomson son to the deceased bailie andrew thomson brewer  edinburgh to the petition of helen  her  bail andrew thomon to jean brown the respondents mother wh ght with her a considerable estate in houses and  and  money  far the  of the  was betwixt them and as a contract of  it is not to be doubted but jean brown care to have suitable provisions to  marriage but of these the respondent can say  as the petitioner did acknowledge before the  when the first submission depended that she had burnt the said contract which is sufficient of itself to show the disposition of this woman toward her husbands children of the first marriage  jean brown died in the      and left three sons and one daughter but bailie thomson finding it not convenient  keep house by himself married the titioner in the    0 with whom he got an annuity of  00 merks payable out of some houses in the cowgate which she had from  gilchrist her former husband but so far was she from bringing the money alleged with her that her housholdfurniture was sold to pay her debt and was not sufficient neither could it be as her first husband was bankrupt and his estate soon after brought to sale before your lordships and purchased by bailie thomson for payment of which he sold part of the lands in potterow which came by his first wife during the subsistence of this marriage bailie thomson purchaled some houses and sold others and carried on an extensive trade as a brewer and distiller which was managed by the respondent from      to      when the petitioner wanting to have the respondent away from his fathers presence and from any management in his business prevailed on the father to take a brewery for him for which he promised to give him at the rate of    bolls of malt for all the years he had served in his brewery part of which he got but not near to the quantity promised which was all the stock the respondent had from his father and was far from being sufficient to enable him to carry on his trade  but abut the      the bailie finding his own breweryaffairs going into disorder under the management of the petitioner be solicited the respondent to come back again and take upon him the management thereof which he did under the promise of ten pound per annum to keep his pocket which he never got so that the petitioner is in the wrong to say that the bailies affairs were brought into disorder by any advancements or cautionry for him it is true he became bound for andrew his second son at his setting up a cloth and silk shop to the extent of l  00 which will fall to be more particularly noticed afterward basides this the bailie gave a portion with his daughter when she was married but the respondent knows not what that was and he gave l  0 to his third son adam who was bred a surgeon when he went abroad this is all so far as the respondent knows that the bailie gave to his children of the first marriage which was far from bringing his affairs into any disorder for after that he continued in very good circumstances possessed of houses which yielded him l     a year of rent besides his extensive trade as brewer and distiller  the bailie finding himself growing old      of this date thought it reasonable to make a settlement of his estate among his children of the first and second marriage in which he disponed to the respondent his houses in bristow and potterow which yielded l    of rent besides which he had formerly at making the purchase of the brewery in the grassmarket and some other houses in the town secured the fee of them to the respondent which made the share designed him by his father to be about l  0 a year but this was burdened with the petitioners liferent to the extent of l        he likewise disponed to adam his third son of the first marriage lands in the westport to the extent of l    and to john his eldest son of the second marriage he gave lands about the foot of forresters wynd and about the mealmarket and exchange which yielded l       s of rent and to joseph his second son of the second marriage he gave his lands in the cannongate head which yielded l     0 s of rent to anne and elizabeth he gave the lands in netherbow and leith which yielded l  0    s of rent to jean and helen he gave some houses above smiths land but as these were sold by himself he by an afterdeed burdened his executors with the payment of l  00 to each of them and to janet he gave his houses in niddreys wynd which yielded l     s and as the respondents part was so far affected with the petitioners liserent the bailie burdened john with the payment of  00 merks to him during the continuance of the liferent and with a  00 merks to andrew his second son during his life to whom he gave no part of his heritance  here it will be proper to inform your lordships of andrews situation it has been already observed that the bailie had become bound with his son andrew at his setting up shop for l  00 to robert pringle upon this stock andrew carried on business for some time and dealt with snee and company merchants in london but his sales not being able to answer his credit and his father refusing to become further bound for him his london creditors refused to give him any more advances and were threating diligence to prevent which and to bring the creditors into a composition it was agreed that he should make over by assignation his whole shop goods extending to near l  00 to his father who about this time had got right to the debt for which he had become cautioner and the whole goods were put into his possession but having got possession thereof he was persuaded by some very bad advice to refuse to give the said enlish creditors who were the only other creditors of andrew any share thereof though they were willing to have accepted ten shillings in the pound and for his further security he executed a shampoinding of these goods already in his own hands which so irritated the creditors that they indorsed their bills to mr mansfield who brought a process against the bailie for payment of their debt extending to l          in which the assignation and poinding were reduced but the bailie dying before decree was pronounced the process was transferred against the petitioner and all the children of the bailie of the first and second marriage and decree was obtained against them all sor that sum this circumstance and perhaps some reflections by andrew that his father had not acted according to the agreement with him was the reason why the bailie in the settlement of his affairs gave him nothing but the liferentannuity of  00 merks  the bailie about this time finding himself a dying executed a settlement of his movables to the petitioner      mr montgomery now commissioner of the customs william wardrobe john bell and andrew chalmer as trustees for his five daughters of the second marriage who were authorized to turn all his movables into money to be stockt out on annual rent and to be liferented by the petitioner for the aliment and education of her children and in respect he had sold the houses disponed to jean and helen in the settlement      he ordained them to secure l  00 sterling to each of them beside their share of the residue which they were to draw with the rest of their sisters when the liserent ceased but it is expressly provided that during the petitioners life and continuing unmarried she was to have the sole management of these subjects and the management of the other trustees was only to commence when any one of these events happened so that the petitioner has no reason to complain that these trustees refused to accept of the trust seeing during her life they could have no power to act in this deed the trustees are appointed to sell the houses in cannongatehead which he by the deed      had conveyed to joseph who was then dead and to pay the price thereof to the trustees for the creditors of mr mantgomery of wrae from whom he had bought it at a judicial sale  bailie thomson having thus settled his affairs wherein he did full justice to the petitioner and her children died soon after in opulent circumstances as was reputed by all that knew him both in heritage and movables and not above l  00 of debt and after his death there was a meeting of some friends for the respondent with the petitioner at which she complained loudly of the bailies settlements and alleged his affairs were in disorder and that his effects would not be able to answer his debts and the other purpose therein designed upon which an offer was made for the respondent that if she would give up her right to the movables she should have sufficient security for l  00 to herself and children and be freed of all her husbands debts but this she absolutely refused and as she had a right to the movables so she kept possession of them and she has acknowledged that she likewise kept possession and uplifted the rents of all the houses belonging to her husband except two or three little houses which the respondent uplifted the rents of which afforded him but a scrimp maintainence and the petitioner after keeping possession of her husbands effects and carrying on the brewing and distilling as formerly from the month of april when her husband died to the month of december she at last confirmed herself executor but took care to give up as little in inventary as she could with decency do  the respondent being thus stripped of his fathers inheritance was about raising a process for recovering his right when a submission was proposed which was readily gone into by him and his brother andrew who likewise thought himself injured as they had not money to carry on processes and their disputes were accordingly submitted to mess george boswal and andrew dechar who had several meetings with the parties and their doers but in all their meetings especially after the      he perceived an evident partiality in favors of the petitioner who got allowance of every article claimed by her but this submission happening to expire without any decreetarbitral being pronounced the respondent was resolved never to submit his affair again to these arbiters and brought a process against the petitioner before the sheriff to account for her intromissions with her husbands effects and for freeing him of his fathers moveable debts  the petitioner afraid of being brought to account and anxious to have the submission renewed to the same arbiters fell upon this stratagem she paid mansfields debt and took right to his decree and diligence in the name of william richaradson her trustee which decree was against her and all the representatives of bailie thomson and which she as sole intromitter with his effects was obliged to pay and upon this diligence a caption was raised and the respondent was taken and threatened with being put in prison unless he would renew the submission to the same arbiters which he alsolutely refused whereupon he was put in prison on the   th july      an his brother andrew who was then in a dying condition under a decay came up in the afternoon to see him and he was likewise arrested but no entreaties by his wife and her friends representing the danger he was in of dying in prison could prevail with mr richardson the petitioners trustee and john walker her soninlaw and ordinary doer to consent to his liberation unless the respondent and his brother would sign a new submission to these arbiters so they past that night in prison in which andrew had almost died which with the most earnest solicitations of andrews wife and her cousin bailie blackwood and of george balfour andrews doer induced the respondent next day to sign this extraordinary submission but at the same time he declared that he would rather have lain in prison till he rotted than have signed the submission to these arbiters had it not been out of regard to his brother and save his life and here its to be observed that these solicitors were all the friends of andrew and acting for him but had no connection with the respondent  upon signing of this submission they were soon after set at liberty and not the least demand was made upon either of them for payment of the debt upon which they were laid in prison nor of any corroborative security therefore they had obtained the sole purpose for which they had execute the caption but they took care that richardson in whose name the caption was should noit be a partysubmitter so that diligence was still kept as an aweband over their heads in case they should offer to quarrel the submission on account of its being extorted from them metu carceris it being in their power to put it in execution at any time  whether the arbiters had any meetings afterward before the signing of the decreetarbitral upon the  th november following the respondent knows not but one thing he is sure of that he never met with them after nor did he ever desire or empower his doer william garden to meet with them or to give in any papers or memorials to them and so far as he knows mr garden never met with any of them nor gave in any memorials to them for he had told him that he was resolved to quarrel the submission whenever he was in a capacity to do it  the decreetarbitral was no sooner put into the register than a charge was given to the respondent to obtemper the decreetarbitral and upon his refusing a caption was taken out which obliged him to retire to the abbey and there he was narrowly watched for several years with different messengers in case he should happen at any time to come out of the sanctuary as he was stripped of all his fathers inheritance and had nothing to live on but the charity of friends it was no wonder that he was not able to bring his quarrel of this submission and decreetarbitral sooner  the petitioner having got the decreetarbitral absolutely to her mind she for herself and children and her soninlaw john walker led adjudications against the estate which obliged the other creditors likewise to adjudge and a process of ranking and sale was carried on in the name of richardson the petitioners trustee in which a state of the debts was made out where she her children and john walker her soninlaw craved to be ranked for no less a sum than l   0     0 sterling which is more than the proven value of the estate and would have been tanked accordingly of the respondent had not appeared and opposed the same and this over and above the pettioners  with the whole movables of her husband and the rents of his estate for   years when the respondent the fathers eldest son and heir to his mother who brought so large a part of this subject with her is stripped of all  the respondent hopes he will be excused in giving your lordships so full a detail of past transactions which he thought himself obliged to do that your lordships might have a just and true view of the matter he shall now proceed to consider the several arguments insisted upon for altering the lord ordinarys interlocutor twice adhered to by his lordship  the first is that there is no legal evidence that the submission was signed in prison as to which it is true that mr alexander blackwood is the only person who depones to the precise fact of the submission being signed in prison but as he was an instrumentary witness to their signing the submission there and the only surviving instrumentary witness it is submitted to your lordships whether his single deposition is not a sufficient proof of the fact in which he could not be mistaken nor under any doubt though he uses the precaution which every witness is allowed to do especially when deponing of facts which happened    years before that to the best of his remembrance he carried up a scrole of the proposed submission to the prisoners which they revised and that they having agreed to the scrole he afterward carried up the submission extended upon stamp paper and that to the best of his remembrance he received both the scrole and principal submission either from mr balfour or from mrs thomson the prisoners wife and that to the best of his remembrance he saw both the said james and andrew thomsons sign the said principal submission in the prison to which so far as he can recollect he is a subscribing witness and that the deponent thinks they were very soon released after signing the submission  he also says that he remembers that both the said james and andrew thomsons seemed averse to enter into the said submission and that james in particular said he was afraid it might hurt him with respect to some deeds execute by his father in favors of him the said james he swears likewise to andrews bad state of health and that his wife was anxious for his liberation and told him that their liberation was offered them upon condition of their signing a submission and that at her desire he went several times up to prison to persuade him and that george balfour andrews doer was with him at some of these times this the respondent apprehends is as full and satisfying a proof as can be desired and as could well be expected when the other instrumentary witness is dead and it is confirmed in every other circumstance except the signing of the submission in prison by maney blackwood the widow of andrew thomson who as being more particularly concerned in the affair than bailie blackwood is more pointed and clear as to several circumstances attending that transaction than he can be supposed to be at such a distance of time and in an affair where he had but an accidental concern and if this proof should not be thought sufficient the respondent could yet adduce two other witnesses alexander henderson and james brown who came up to them in prison after their signing the submission and were employed by them to go and seek money to pay the prisondues in order to their getting out  it is next said that though the fact of signing the submission in prison was proven yet it was not relevant to set aside the decreetarbitral which is endeavored to be supported at great length and several cases are taken notice of concerning transactions with debtors in prison for payment of just debts or for granting additional securities therefore but the respondent apprehends that the law is quite clear by the civil law the edict of praetor was the rule quod metus causa gestum erit ratum non babebo and in the   d l dig quod metus causa in carcerem quem detrusit ut aliquid ei extorqueret quid ob banc causam sactum est nultius momenti est and lord stair tit reparation parag   that by the praetors edict and the custom of this and other nations such deeds and obligations as are by force and fear are made utterly void and he cites a decision very parallel to the present case   d january      mair contra stewart of shambelly where metus was sustained to reduce a bond granted by a party taken by caption because he was sick the respondent apprehends that there is no compulsitor in law to oblige a person to enter into a submission that can only be brought about by the free and voluntary consent of parties and therefore the using a diligence which is allowed by law for recovering payment of a debt for this purpose is a perverting of the law and the using it so against a person sick and in danger of dying was a glaring and gross perverting of the law which the petitioner is forced to own will afford a ground for reducing these deeds as exported vi et metu carceris the respondent might add that as the petitioner had possessed herself of all her husbands effects and she has acknowledged that she had paid that debt no doubt out of the produce of her husbands effects as she had no other funds he submits it to your lordships how far she could have used that diligence against the respondent for repayment of it to her as she the executrix had already paid it out of the funds of her husband the original debtor and if she could not then all her argument justifying the imprisonment of the respondent and his brother falls to the ground  the respondent apprehends he needs not take up much time in answering the several cases founded on by the petitioner in support of her claim for in these the intention of imprisonment was to get payment or security and the debtor was under an obligation to pay the debt or to grant further security for it and if he either paid it in prison of granted new security for it he did no more than the law obliged him to do and therefore these transactions may be held good in law though done in prison and in these cases the debtor gave a full consent to the transaction whereas here the respondent gave no consent to the thing and showed to demonstration that he only did it to save his brothers life and procure personal liberty to both but at the same time it is certain that if any iniquity was done to persons in prison by these transactions they would be reduced on this head which makes a very material difference between these cases and the present one for here if the submission be supported the decreetarbitral following thereon how iniquous soever cannot be reduced iniquity not being one of the grounds of law for reducing a decreetarbitral  the petitioner endeavors to justify her insisting on a submission as a reasonable action for settling the mutual claims which each party had on one another but here it will be observed that the petitioner had no claim upon the respondent but to get him to confirm her illegal usurpation of all her husbands estate he indeed had a claim against her to restore to him what part of his fathers inheritance he had left to him and to free him of his fathers moveable debts which she was obliged to do as intromitter with his moveable effects but from past experience he had found that he was in no likelihood to obtain this before the former arbiters and therefore nothing but to save his brothers life could have induced him to submit his cause again to these gentlemen however good their character may be otherwise their decerning such a sum to the petitioner and her children and at the same time stripping the respondent is sufficient to show the iniquity of their decreetarbitral but he apprehends his plea for reducing the submission is good upon the head of fear and force  the petitioner says that the respondent did homologate the submission when he was at liberty by his doer william garden giving in memorials and other papers to the arbiters upon the subject of the submission this has already been taken notice of and denied and it is but very faintly alleged by the petitioner for all she can say on this head is that it appears from mr gardens comptbook where he states an article in his account with the respondent for drawing a memorial to be given in to these arbiters how the petitioner got access to mr gardens comptbooks is not known but from her stating it it does not appear whether this memorial was to be given in to the arbiters during the dependence of the first submission or of the second neither does it appear whether ever that memorial was given in to the arbiters but if it was given in to them during the second submssion he positively denies that ever he gave mr garden any warrant or commission to give in such memorial  it is said in support of his having homologate the submission that he made no challenge of it for some years though he was at his full liberty all the while your lordships will have observed from the narrative of the case that he was far from being at liberty the petitioner had no less than two captions against him one upon mansfields debt and the other upon the decreetarbitral and the messengers hired to watch him in case he came out of the abbey it was no doubt the respondents interest to have brought his quarrel sooner but his want of liberty and especially his want of money to carry on the process was the occasion of the delay and if he had not got your lordships gratis warrant he must have been silent still at the same time he apprehends it would have been competent to him to have brought his action any time within forty years  it is an affected pretense in the petitioner to say that she has lost the vouchers of her accounts which she looked upon as unnecessary to be kept for so long a time by which she could have supported the decreetarbitral in every point for your lordships will have observed that the respondent de recenti refused to ratify and fulfill the decreetarbitral and said he would quarrel it whenever he had it in his power whereupon she took a caption against him and that being the case it is not probable that she has lost any one of her vouchers  in support of the reasons of reduction before the lord ordinary several particular iniquities committed by the arbiters were mentioned and many more could have been insisted on but as there were objections and answers lying before his lordship to be advised when the decreetarbitral should be set aside there were only a few noticed which the petitioner has endeavored to take off which makes it necessary for the respondent to resume them though he thinks his reduction well founded without them the first was that she ought to have shown diligence for setting the houses and for recovering the rents and outstanding debts which the arbiters had not found her liable to do upon which it is now said that iniquity in arbiters is no ground for reducing their decreetarbitral and  dly that it would have been improper for an executor to waste the funds of the executry in doing diligence for debts where there was not the smallest prospect of recovery but at this rate every executor might have it in his power to do what she pleased with the executry without being liable to quarrel from any hand whereas it is an established rule in law that an executor must make up full inventaries in a cafe where there is a competition of claimants whether creditors or heirs and is liable to do diligence for making the executry effectual and is obliged to find a cautioner for that effect no body to be sure would insist that she should lay out good money in seeking in desperate debts but still it was incumbent upon her to show what of these debts were desperate which she was not ordained to do by the arbiters  the petitioner now has acknowledged that she has recovered of the executry to the amount of l  00 sterling and upwards the respondent believes she has or might have recovered a great deal mare as it was reputed to be above l   00 but here a question naturally occurs what has she done with this great sum of executry intromitted with by her the defuncts moveable debts ought naturally to have been paid out of his executry has she done that it is believed she will not answer in the affirmative the debts of her husband were in and about l  00 sterling and it appears from the list of debts now in the ranking that they are all still outstanding and not so much as the annualrent of any of them paid though besides this executry intromitted with by her she had nine years possession of her husbands heritable estate of l     per annum except the two houses possessed by the respondent notwithstanding whereof the arbiters find her a creditor on the subject for l  0        sterling and l        sterling  it was noticed before the lord ordinary that the arbiters had committed iniquity in finding the petitioner entitled to aliment for her children which is now said to be highly just as their provisions consisted in certain heritable subjects which were liferented by their mother and that therefore they were entitled to be alimented with their fathers effects till they came to enjoy their own provisions here an obvious answer will occur the father by his deed in the      disponed to the petitioners children houses which yielded upwards of l  0 of rent and as the petitioners two liferents amounting to   00 merks or l        sterling was laid upon the respondents part of the heritage to the extent of l        sterling it is evident that very little of her childrens provisions stood affected with their mothers liferent so that if she had managed matters aright there was a sufficiency to have alimented her children out to their own provisions and she had besides the residue of the executry over payment of the debts made over to her by her husband but though that had not been the case a question would have arisen in case the estate be bankrupt as she pretends whether the creditors would be obliged to maintain her children or not especially when she their mother was peaceably enjoying two jointures extending to   00 merks free of all public burdens and another question would have occured whether the respondent as matters stood by the deeds of his father would have been obliged to aliment his brothers and sisters supposing the estate had not been bankrupt  another article of complaint against the decreetarbitral mentioned before the ordinary was that the expenses of repairs of the houses which she had in liferent from her last husband were allowed her through that was not provided in the contract of marriage to which it is now said that the husband became bound that the houses should yield  00 merks free of all taxations and public burdens but reparation of liferented houses is a burden upon the liserenter and is neither to be accounted a taxation or public burden  the petitioner in the last place endeavors to make an apology for the smalness of the rent accounted for by her for the five years of her intromission preceding the decreetarbitral when compared with the five years rents uplifted by your lordships factor when the estate was sequestrate and says that sundry of the houses were waste and in bad repair and that the sums laid out by her in reparing them made them set better afterward but here it is to be observed that after all her repairs the highest rent she brings up the houses to in the last year of her intromission is but l     and some odd shillings whereas the factors rental is l      and upon the whole the petitioner concludes that there is no good exception against the justice of the decreetarbitral and that there is no relevant ground in law for reducing this submission and that iniquity is no relevant ground for reducing the decreetarbitral the respondent apprehends that he has much better ground to say that the decreetarbitral is in every particular iniquous and that whether it was iniquous or not he is founded in law to reduce the submission the signing of which was elicit from him and his brother metu carceris and that the petitioner by her extraordinary illegal and unwarrantable management of her husband and childrens affairs has occasioned difficulties and probably loss which may not be easily recovered from her and she in the mean time is quietly in possession of   00 merks free of public burdens though she has only now two of her six children with her while the respondent the heir has not a farthing of his fathers effects to live upon which he hopes will merit the consideration of the court  in respect whereof etc geo pringle
