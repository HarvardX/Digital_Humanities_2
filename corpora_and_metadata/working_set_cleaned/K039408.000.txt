talked of a good while well go tell miss constantia that i will be with her immediately   nan i shall mrs betty exit nanny   bet so i find they all believe the impertinent creature is breeding that is pure it will soon reach my ladys ear i warrant enter john with letters well john ever a letter for me   john no mrs betty but here is one for miss constantia   bet give it me  hum  my ladys hand   john and here is one which the postman says is for my young master but it is a strange direction reads to charles egerton esquire   bet o yes  yes  that is for master charles john for he has drop his fathers name of mac sycophant and has taken up that of egerton  the parliament has ordered it   john the parliament prythee why so mrs betty   bet why you must know john that my lady his mother was an egerton by her father she stole a match with our old master for which all her family on both sides have hated sir pertinax and the whole crew of the mac sycophants ever since   john except master charles mrs betty   bet o they dote upon him for though he be a mac sycophant he is the pride of all my ladys family  and so john my ladys uncle sir stanley egerton dying an old bachelor and as i said before mortally hating our old master and the whole crew of the mac sycophants lest his whole estate to master charles who was his godson but on condition though that he should drop his fathers name of mac sycophant and take up that of egerton and that is the reason john why the parliament has made him change his name   john i am glad that master charles has got the estate however for he is a sweet tempered gentleman   bet as ever lived but come john as i know you love miss constantia and are fond of an opportunity of speaking to her i will make you happy you shall carry her letter to her   john shall i mrs betty i am very much obliged to you where is she   bet in the housekeepers room settling the desert  give me mr egertons letter i will lay it on the table in his dressing room i see it is from his brother mr sandy so now go and deliver your letter to your sweetheart john   john that i will mrs betty and i am much obliged to you for the savor of letting me carry it to her for though she should never have me yet i shall always love her and wish to be near her she is so sweet a creature  your servant mrs betty i will kiss the letter for her sake  sweet sweet dear miss constantia  o if i was but kissing her hand betty now instead of this letter how happy should i be  your servant mrs betty exit john   bet your servant john  ha ha ha poor fellow he perfectly doats on her and daily follows her about with nosegays and fruit and the first of every thing in the season ay and my young master charles too he is in as bad a way as the gardener  in short every body loves her and that is one reason why i hate her  for my part i wonder what the deuce the men see in her  a creature that was taken in for charity  i am sure she is not so handsome  i wish she was out of the family once if she was i might then stand a chance of being my ladys favorite myself ay and perhaps of getting one of my young masters for a sweetheart  or at least the chaplain  but as to him there would be no such great catch if i should get him  i will try for him however and my first step shall be to let the doctor know all i have discovered about constantias intrigues with her spark at hadley  yes that will do for the doctor loves to talk with me and always smiles and jokes with me  laughs he he  he loves to hear me talk too and i verily believe he he he that he has a sneaking kindness for me besides this story will make him have a good opinion of my honesty and that i am sure will be one step toward it  o bless me here he comes and my young master with him  i will watch an opportunity to speak to him as soon as he is alone for i will blow her up i am resolved as great a favorite and as cunning as she is exit   enter egerton  in great warmth and emotion sidney following as in earnest conversation sid nay dear charles but why are you so impetuous why do you break from me so abruptly   egert i have done sir  you have refused  i have nothing more to say upon the subject  i am satisfied   sid  spoke with a glow of tender friendship come come correct this warmth it is the only weak ingredient in your nature and you ought to watch it carefully if i am wrong i will submit without reserve but consider the nature of your request and how it would affect me from your earliest youth your father has honored me with the care of your education and the general conduct of your mind and however singular and morose his behavior may be toward others to me he has ever been respectful and liberal i am now under his roof too  and because i will not abet an unwarrantable passion by an abuse of my sacred character in marrying you beneath your rank and in direct opposition to your fathers hopes and happiness  you blame  you angrily break from me and call me unkind   egert  with kindness and conviction dear sidney for my warmth i stand condemned but for my marriage with constantia i think i can justify it upon every principle of filial duty honor and worldly prudence   sid only make that appear charles and you know you may command me   egert i am sensible how unworthy it appears in a son to descant on the unamiable passions of a father but as we are alone and friends i cannot help observing in my own defense that when a father will not allow the use of reason to any of his family  when his pursuit of greatness makes him a slave abroad  only to be a tyrant at home  when his narrow partiality to scotland on every trivial occasion provokes him to enmity even with his wife and children only because they dare give a national preference where they think it is most justly due  and when merely to gratify his own ambition he would marry his son into a family he detests  with great warmth sure sidney a son thus circumstanced from the dignity of human nature and the feelings of a loving heart has a right not only to protest against the blindness of the parent but to pursue those measures that virtue and happiness point out   sid the violent temper of sir pertinax i own cannot on many occasions be defended  but still your intended alliance with lord lumbercourt    egert o contemptible a trifling quaint haughty voluptuous servile tool  the mere lackey of party and corruption who for the prostitution of near thirty years and the ruin of a noble fortune has had the despicable satisfaction and the infamous honor of being kicked up and kicked down kicked in and kicked out  just as the insolence compassion or convenience of leaders predominated and now being forsaken by all parties his whole political consequence amounts to the power of franking a letter and the right honorable privilege of not paying a tradesmans bill   sid well but dear charles you are not to wed my lord but his daughter   egert who is as disagreeable for a companion as her father is for a friend or an ally   sid ha ha ha what her scotch accent i suppose offends you   egert no  upon my honor  not in the least i think it entertaining in her but were it otherwise in decency  and indeed in national affection being a scotchman myself i can have no objection to her on that account  besides she is my near relation   sid so i understand  but how comes lady rodolpha who i find was born in england to be bred in scotland   egert from the dotage of an old formal obstinate stiff rich scotch grandmother who upon a promise of leaving this grandchild all her fortune which is very considerable would have the girl sent to her to scotland when she was but a year old and there has she been bred up ever since with this old lady in all the vanity and unlimitted indulgence that fondness and admiration could bestow on a spoiled child a fancied beauty and a pretended wit   sid o you are too severe on her   egert i do not think so sidney for she seems a being expressly fashioned by nature to figure in these days of levity and dissipation her spirits are inexhaustible her parts strong and lively with a sagacity that discerns and a talent not unhappy in painting the weak side of whatever comes before her  but what raises her merit to the highest pitch in the laughing world is her boundless vanity in the exertion of those talents which often renders herself much more ridiculous than the most whimsical of the characters she exposes  and is this a woman fit to make my happiness this the partner that sidney would recommend to me for life to you who best know me i appeal   sid why charles it is a delicate point  unfit for me to determine  besides your father has set his mind upon the match   egert  impatiently all that i know  but still i ask and insist upon your candid judgment is she the kind of woman that you think could possibly contribute to my happiness  i beg you will give me an explicit answer   sid the subject is disagreeable  but since i must speak  i do not think she is   egert i know you do not and i am sure you never will advise the match   sid i never did  i never will   egert  with a start of joy you make me happy  which i assure you i never could be with your judgment against me on this point   sid and yet charles give me leave to observe that lady rodolpha with all her ridiculous laughing vanity has a goodness of heart and a kind of vivacity that not only entertains but upon seeing her two or three times improves upon you and when her torrent of spirits abates and she condescends to converse gravely you will really like her   egert why aye she is sprightly goodhumoured and though whimsical and often too high in her coloring of characters and in the trifling business of the idle world yet i think she has principles and a good heart but in a partner for life sidney you know your own precept  your own judgment affection capricious in its nature must have something even in the external manners  nay in the very mode not only of beauty but virtue itself which both heart and judgment must approve or our happiness in that delicate point cannot be lasting   sid i grant it   egert and that mode that amiable essential i never can meet with but in constantia  you sigh   sid no i only wish that constantia had a fortune equal to yours but pray charles suppose i had been so indiscreet as to have agreed to marry you to constantia would she have consented think you   egert that i cannot say positively but i suppose so   sid did you never speak to her upon that subject then   egert in general terms only never directly asked her consent in form but i will this very moment for i have no asylum from my fathers arbitrary design but my constantias arms  pray do not stir from hence  i will return instantly i know she will submit to your advice and i am sure you will persuade her to my wish as my life my peace my earthly happiness depend upon my constantia exit   sid poor charles he little dreams that i love constantia  but to what degree i knew not myself till he importuned me to join their hands  yes i love but must not be a rival  for he is dear to me as fraternal friendship  my benefactor my friend and that name is sacred it is our better self and ought to be preferred  for the man who gratifies his passions at the expense of his friends happiness wants but a head to contrive for he has a heart capable of the blackest vice   enter betty raming up to him bet i beg pardon sir for my intrusion i hope sir i do not disturb you   sid not in the least mrs betty   bet i humbly hope you will excuse me sir  but i wanted to break my mind to your honor about a scruple  that lies upon my conscience  and indeed i should not have presumed to trouble you sir but that i know you are my young masters friend  and indeed a friend to the whole family  runs up to him and curtseys very low for to give you your due sir you are as good a preacher as ever went into a pulpit   sid ha ha ha do you think so mrs betty   bet ay in truth do i  and as good a gentleman too as ever came into a family and one that never gives a servant a hard word nor that does any one an ill turn neither behind ones back nor before ones face   sid ha ha ha  why you are a mightty well spoken woman mrs betty and i am extremely beholden to you for your good character of me   bet indeed sir it is no more than what you deserve and what all the servants say of you   sid i am much obliged to them mrs betty  but pray what are your commands with me   bet why i will tell you sir  to be sure i am but a servant as a body may say and every tub should stand upon its own bottom but she holds him familiarly looks about cautiously and speaks in a low familiar tone of great secrecy my young master is now in the china room in close conference with miss constantia  i know what they are about  but that is no business of mine  and therefore i made bold to listen a little because you know sir one would be sure before one took away any bodys good name   sid very true mrs betty  very true indeed   bet oh heavens forbid that i should take away any young womans good name unless i had good reason for it  but sir if i am in this place alive  as i listened with my ear close to the door  i heard my young master ask miss constantia  the plain marriage question upon which i started and trembled  nay my very conscience stirred within me so that i i i could not help peeping through the keyhole   sid ha ha ha  and so your conscience made you peep through the keyhole mrs betty  ha   bet it did indeed sir and then i saw my young master down upon his knees and what do you think he was doing  lord bless us  kissing her hand as if he would eat it and protesting and assuring her he knew that you sir would consent to the match  and then o my good sir the tears ran down her cheeks as fast    sid ay   bet crying tenderly they did indeed sir i would not tell your reverence a lie for the world   sid i believe it mrs betty i believe it and what did constantia say to all this   bet sneering severely and shaking her head o she is fly enough  she looks as if butter would not melt in her mouth but all is not gold that glistens  smooth water you know runs deepest speaks this with sorrow i am sorry my young master makes himself such a fool very sorry indeed but um  ha  take my word for it he is not the man sneeringly for though she looks as modest as a maid at a christening besitating yet a  when sweethearts meet in the dusk of the evening  and stay together a whole hour in a dark grove  and  a  embrace  and kiss  and weep at parting  why then you know sir  it is easy to guess all the rest   sid why did constantia meet any body in this manner   bet starting with surprise o heavens i beg sir you will not misapprehend me for i assure you i do not believe they did any harm  that is  not in the grove  at least not when i was there  and she may be honestly married for aught i know  o lud sir i would not say an ill thing of miss constantia for all the world  for to besure she is a good creature  it is true my lady took her in for charity  and indeed has bred her up to the music and figures  ay and to reading all the books about homer  and paradise  and gods and devils  and every thing in the world  as if she had been a duchess  but some people are born with luck in their mouths  and then as the saying is you may throw them into the sea  deports herself most affectedly  but if i had had dancing masters and music and french monsieurs to teach me smiles coquets and puts on important airs of affectation i believe i might read the globes and the maps and have danced and have been as clever as other folks   sid ha ha ha  no doubt of it mrs betty no doubt in the least  but mrs betty you mentioned something of a dark walk  about kissing  a sweetheart  and constantia   bet o lud sir i dont know any thing of the matter  she may be very honest for ought i know  i only say that they did meet in the dark walk and all the servants are laughing and tittering and constantly observing that miss constantia wears her stays very loose  looks very pale  is sick in a morning and after dinner  and as sure as my name is betty hint something has happened that i will not name but nine months hence a certain person in this family may ask me to stand godmother for i think i know what is what when i see it as well as another   sid no doubt you do mrs betty   bet i do indeed sir and she cries turns up her eyes and acts a most friendly devout hypocrisy i am very sorry for miss constantia i never thought she would have taken such courses  for in truth i love her as if she were my own sister  and though all the servants say she is breeding yet for my part i dont believe it  but one must speak according to ones conscience you know sir   sid i see you do mrs betty   bet i do indeed sir and so your servant sir  going away and returning but i hope your worship will not mention my name in this business or that you had any item from me   sid i shall not mrs betty   bet for indeed sir i am no busybody  nor do i love fending and proving  and i assure you sir i hate all tittling and tattling and gossipping and backbiting and taking away a young persons character be her ever so bad   sid i observe you do mrs betty   bet i do indeed sir i am the farthest from it in the world   sid i dare say you are   bet i am indeed sir and so your humble servant   sid your servant mrs betty   bet aside in great exultation so i see he believes every word i say  that is charming  i will do her business for her i am resolved exit   sid what can this ridiculous creature mean  by her dark walk  her private spark  her kissing  and all her slanderous insinuations against constantia whose conduct is as unblameable as innocence itself i see envy is as malignant in a paltry waiting wench as in the vainest or most ambitious lady of the court it is always a most infallible mark of the basest nature and merit in the lowest as in the highest station must feel the shafts of envys constant agents falsehood and slander  enter sam sam sir mr egerton and miss constantia desire to speak with you in the china room   sid very well sam exit sam  i will not see them  what is to be done inform his father of his intended marriage  no that must not be  for the overbearing temper and ambitious policy of sir pertinax would exceed all bounds of moderation he has banished one son already only for daring to differ from his judgment concerning the merits of scotch and english historians  but this young man must not marry constantia  would his mother were here  she i suppose knows nothing of his indiscretion but she shall the moment she comes hither  i know it will offend him  no matter it is our duty to offend when the offense saves the man we love from a precipitate action which the world must condemn and his own heart perhaps upon reflection for ever repent  yes i must discharge the duty of my function and a friend though i am sure to lose the man whom i intend to serve exit   act ii enter egerton and constantia constable mr sidney is not here sir   egert i assure you i left him here and begged that he would stay till i returned   constable his prudence you see sir has made him retire therefore we had better defer the subject till he is present  in the mean time sir i hope you will permit me to mention an affair that has greatly alarmed and perplexed me i suppose you guess what it is   egert i do not upon my word   constable that is a little strange  you know sir that you and mr sidney did me the honor of breakfasting with me this morning in my little study   egert we had that happiness madam   constable just after you left me opening my book of accounts which lay in the drawer of the reading desk to my great surprise i there found this case of jewels containing a most elegant pair of earrings and a necklace of great value and two bank bills in this pocketbook the mystery of which i presume sir you can explain   egert i can   constable they are of your conveying then   egert they were madam   constable i assure you they startled and alarmed me   egert i hope it was a kind alarm such as blushing virtue feels when with her hand she gives her heart and last consent   constable it was not indeed sir   egert do not say so constantia  come be kind at once my peace and worldly bliss depend upon this moment   constable what would you have me do   egert what love and virtue dictate   constable o sir experience but too severely proves that such unequal matches as ours never produce aught but contempt and anger in parents censure from the world and a long train of sorrow and repentance in the wretched parties which is but too often entailed upon their hapless issue   egert but that constantia cannot be our condition for my fortune is independent and ample equal to luxury and splendid folly i have a right to choose the partner of my heart   constable but i have not sir  i am a dependant on my lady  a poor forsaken helpless orphan your benevolent mother found me took me to her bosom and there supplied my parental loss with every tender care indulgent dalliance and with all the sweet persuasion that maternal fondness religious precepts polished manners and hourly example could administer she fostered me weeps and shall i now turn viper and with black ingratitude sting the tender heart that thus has cherished me shall i seduce her houses heir and kill her peace  no though i loved to the mad extreme of female fondness  though every worldly bliss that womans vanity or mans ambition could desire followed the indulgence of my love and all the contempt and misery of this life the denial of that indulgence i would discharge my duty to my benefactress my earthly guardian my more than parent   egert my dear constantia your prudence your gratitude and the cruel virtue of your selfdenial do but increase my love my admiration and my misery   constable sir i must beg you will give me leave to return these bills and jewels   egert pray do not mention them  sure my kindness and esteem may be indulged so far without suspicion or reproach i beg you will accept of them nay i insist   constable i have done sir  my station here is to obey  i know they are the gifts of a virtuous heart and mine shall convert them to the tenderest and most grateful use  weeps   egert hark i hear a coach  it is my father  dear girl retire and compose yourself  i will send sidney and my lady to you and by their judgment we will be directed  will that satisfy you   constable i can have no will but my ladys  with your leave i will retire  i would not see her in this confusion   egert dear girl adieu  and think of love of happiness and the man who never can be blessed without you exit constantia   enter sam sam sir pertinax and my lady are come sir and my lady desires to speak with you in her own room o she is here sir exit sam   enter lady mac sycophant l mac in great confusion and distress dear child i am glad to see you why did you not come to town yesterday to attend the levee your father is incensed to the uttermost at your not being there   egert in great warmth madam it is with extreme regret i tell you that i can no longer be a slave to his temper his politics and his scheme of marrying me to this woman therefore you had better consent at once to my going out of the kingdom and to my taking constantia with me for without her i never can be happy   l mac as you regard my peace or your own character i beg you will not be guilty of so rash a step  you promised me you would never marry her without my consent i will open it to your father  pray dear charles be ruled let me prevail here he comes i will get out of his way  but i beg charles while he is in this ill humor that you will not oppose him let him say what he will  when his passion is a little cool i will return and try to bring him to reason  but pray do not thwart him   egert madam i will not exit l mac   enter sir pertinax  in great haughtiness and anger sir pert weel sir vary weel vary weel  are not you a very fine fellow a hagh  enter tomlins what want you sir   tom sir the groom is come back  he has been as far as hammersmith and the turnpike men and every person upon the road are sure that lord lumbercourt has not passed by this day   sir pert let them take the chestnut gelding and return to town directly and enquire at my lords house whether he is at home or if they know what is become of him  and do you hear  the moment that counselor plausible and mr sergeant eitherside arrive let me know it exit tomlins weel sir pray what do you think of yourself are not you a fine spark  are not you a fine spark i say  so you would not come up to the levee   egert sir i beg your pardon but i  i  i was not very well  besides i did not think that my presence there was necessary   sir pert snaps him up sir it was necessary  i tauld ye it was necessary  and sir i must now tell you that the whole tenor of your conduct is most offensive   egert i am sorry you think so sir  i am sure i do not intend to offend you   sir pert i care not what you intend sir i tell you you do offend  what is the meaning of this conduct  neglect the levee  neglecting the levee is such a contempt and such an ignorance of the world that sdeath sir your  what is your reason i say for thus neglecting the levee and disobeying my commands egerton bows none of your bowing and sighing sir give me an immediate answer   egert with a stifled filial resentment sir i own i am not used to levees nor do i know how to dispose of myself or what to say or do in such a station   sir pert with a proud angry resentment zounds sir do you not see what others do gentle and simple temporal and spiritual lords members judges generals and bishops aw crouding burstling pushing foremost until intul the middle of the circle and there waiting watching and striving to catch a luock or a smile fra the great mon  which they meet with an amicable risibility of aspect a modest cadence of body and a conciliating cooperation of the whole mon which expresses an officious promptitude for his service and indicates that they luock upon themselves as the suppliant appendage of his power and the inlisted swiss of his political fortune  this sir is what you ought to do  and this sir is what i never once omitted for these five and thirty years  let wha would be minister   egert aside contemptible   sir pert what is that ye mutter sir   egert only a slight reflection sir not relative to you   sir pert sir your absenting yourself from the levee at this juncture is suspeecious it is luocked upon as a kind of disaffection and aw your country men are highly offended with your conduct for sir they do not look upon you as a friend or a wellwisher to scotland or to scotchmen   egert with a quick warmth then sir they wrong me i assure you but pray sir in what particular can i be charged either with coldness or offense to my country   sir pert why sir ever since your mothers uncle sir stanly egerton left you this three thousand pounds a year and that you have in compliance with his will taken up the name of egerton they think you are growing proud that you have estranged yourself fra the mac sycophants  have associated with your mothers family  with the opposeetion and with those who do not wish weel to scotland  besides sir in a conversation the other day after dinner at your cousin campbell mkenzies before a whole table full of your ayn relations did you not publicly wish a total extinguishment of aw party and of aw national distinctions whatever relative to the three kingdoms with great anger and was that a prudent wish before so many of your ain countrymen and be damned to you or was it a filial language to hold before me   egert sir with your pardon i cannot think it unfilial or imprudent with a most patriotic warmth i own i do wish most ardently wish for a total extinction of all parties particularly that those of english irish and scotch might never more be brought into contest or competition unless like loving brothers in general emulation for one common cause   sir pert how sir do you persist what would you banish aw party and distinction between english irish and your ain countrymen   egert with great dignity of spirit i would sir   sir pert then damn ye sir ye are nai true scot  ay sir you may luock as angry as you wuol  but again i say  ye are nai true scot   egert your pardon sir i think he is the true scot and the true citizen who wishes equal justice to the merit and demerit of every subject of great britain amongst whom i know but of two distinctions   sir pert weel sir and what are those what are those   egert the knave and the honest man   sir pert pshaw ridiculous  nonsense  stuff  all idle hacknied opposition cant and nonsense   egert and he sir who makes any other be him of the north or of the south of the east or of the west in place or out of place is an enemy to the whole and to the virtues of humanity   sir pert ay sir this is your brothers impudent doctrine  for the which i have banished him for ever fra my presence my heart and my fortune  sir i will have nai son of mine because truly he has been educated in an english seminary presume under the mask of public candor to speak against his native land or my principles sir  scotsmen  scotsmen  sir wherever they meet throughout the globe should unite and stick together as it were in a poleetical phalanx   egert that is a severe judgment sir and according to my observation and indeed my frequent experience consistent neither with truth nor the indiscriminate affection of impartial nature   sir pert how sir not consistent with truth   egert not in my opinion sir for i who am a scotchman as well as you have met with as warm friendships and as many too out of scotland as ever i met with in it   sir pert sir i do not believe you  i do not believe you  but sir you have a saucy lurking prejudice against your ain country you hate it  yes your mother her family and your brother sir have aw the same disaffected rankling and by that and their politics together they will be the ruin of you themselves and aw who connect with them however nai mair of that now i weell talk at large with ye aboot that business anon  in the mean time sir notwithstanding your contempt of my advice and your disobedience till my commands i will convince you of my paternal attention till your welfare by my management with this voluptuary  this lord lumbercourt whose daughter you are to marry  ye ken sir that the fellow has been my patron these three and tharty years   egert true sir   sir pert vary weel  and now sir you see by his prodigality he is become my dependant and accordingly i have made my bargain with him the deel a baubee he has in the world but what comes through these clutches for his whole estate which has three impleecit boroughs on it mark  is now in my custody at nurse the which estate on my paying off his debts and allowing him a liferent of seven thousand pounds per annum is to be made over till me for my life and at my death it is to descend till ye and your issue  the peerage of lumbercourt ye ken will follow of course  so sir ye see by this marriage there are three impleecit boroughs the whole patrimoney of lumbercourt and a peerage at one slap  why it is a stroke  a hit  a hit  zounds sir a man may live a century and not make sic another hit again   egert it is a very advantageous bargain no doubt sir  but what will my lords family say to it   sir pert why man he cares not if his family were aw at the deel so that his luxury be but gratified  only let him have a race horse till feed his vanity his polite blacklegs to advise him in his matches on the turf at cards and at tenis and his harridan till drink drams we him and in her drunken hysterics to scrat his face and burn his periwig or let him have a dozen of his dependants and half a dozen of his swiss borough voters sit up all night drinking bumpers of success to the opposition  and double bumpers of destruction to the ministry and then sir the fellow has aw that he wants and aw that he wishes in this world or the next   enter tomlins tom lady rodolpha is come sir   sir pert and my lord   tom sir he is about a mile or two behind the servants say   sir pert let me know the instant he arrives   tom i shall sir exit   sir pert step ye oot charles and receive lady rodolpha  and i desire sir that you wool treat her with as much respact and gallantry ass possible for my lord has hinted that ye have been a little remiss ass a lover  so go go and receive her with warmth and rapture   egert i

  sir pert dootless sir ye are a blockhead  nae sir i will tell you how i raised it sir  i raised it by boowing  by boowing sir  i never in my life could stand straight in the presence of a great man

penurious income of captains halfpay was the sum total of his fortune and sir aw my proveesion fra him was a medium of latin an expartness at areethmatic and a short system of worldly counsel the chief ingredients of whach were a persevering industry  a reegid economy  a smooth tongue  a pliabeelity of temper  and a constant attention till make every great man well pleased we himself   egert very prudent conduct sir   sir pert therefore sir i lay it before ye  now sir wi these materials i set out a rough rawboned strippling fra the north till try my fortune we them here in the sooth  and my first step intull the world was a beggarly clerkship in sawney gordons coontinghouse here in the city of london whach you will say afforded but a barren sort of a prospect   egert it was not a very fertile one indeed sir   sir pert the reverse  the reverse  weel sir seeing my sell in this unprofitable seetuation i reflacted deeply i cast aboot my thoughts and concluded that a matrimonial adventure prudently conducted would be the readiest gate i could gang for the bettering of my condition and accordingly i set aboot it now sir in this pursuit  beauty  beauty  ah i beauty often struck mine even and played aboot my heart  and fluttered and beat and knocked  and knocked  but the deel an entrance i ever let it get  for i observed that beauty is generally a prood vain saucy expensive sort of a commodity   egert very justly observed sir   sir pert and therefore i left it to the prodigals and coxcombs that could afford till pay for it and its stead sir mark  i luockd oot for an ancient well jointered superanuated dowager  a consumptive toothless ptisical wealthy widow  or a shreeveled cadaverous neglected piece of deformity in the shape of an eezard or an appersiand  or in

where do ye think i ganged to luock for this woman we the siller nai till court  nai till play houses nor assemblies  nai sir i ganged till the kirk  till the anabaptist eendependant bradleonian muckletonian meetings  till the morning and evening service of churches and chapples of ease  and till the midnight melting conciliating love feasts of the methodists  and there at last sir i fell upon an old rich sower slighted antiquated musty maiden she was as tall as a grenadier and so thin that she luocked ha ha ha she luocked  just like a skeleton in a surgeonss glasscase  now sir this meeserable object was releegiously angry wi herself and aw the world  and had nai comfort but in a supernatural vicious and enthusiastic delirums ha ha ha sir she was mad  ass mad as a bedlamite   egert not impossible sir  there are numbers of poor creatures in the same condition   sir pert o numbers numbers  now sir this cracked creature used to pray and sing and sigh and groan and weep and wail and gnash her teeth constantly morning and evening at the tabernacle in moorfields and as soon as i found she had the siller aha  in good truth i plumpt me done upon my knees close by her cheek by jole and praid and sighed and groaned and gnashed my teeth as vehemently ass she could do for the life of her  ay and turned up the whites of mine even till the strings awmost cracked again  weel sir i watched her motions  handed her till her chair  waited on her home  got most releegiously intimate we her  in a week married her  in a fortnight buried her  in a month touched the siller  and we

rodol generous indeed cousin but not awhit nobler i assure you than your brother sandy believes of you and be assured sir that we shall remember it while the heart feels or memory retains a sense of gratitude  but noow sir let me ask one question  pray how is your mother affected in this business   egert she knows of my passion and will i am sure be a friend to the common cause   l rodol ah that is lucky our first step then must be to take her advice in our conduct so as to keep our faithers in the dark till we can bit off some measure that we will wind them aboot till oor ain purpose and the common interest of our ain passion   egert you are very right madam for should my father suspect my brothers affection for your ladyship or mine for constantia there is no guessing what would be the consequence his whole happiness depends upon this bargain with my lord for it gives him the possession of three boroughs and those madam are much dearer to him than the happiness of his children i am sorry to say it but to gratify his political rage he would sacrifice every social tie that is dear to friend or family exeunt   act iv enter sir pertinax and counselor plausible sir pert no  no  come away counselor plausible  come away i say  let them chew upon it  let them chew upon it  why counselor did you ever hear so impartinant so meddling and so obstinate a blockhead as that sergeant eitherside confound the fellow he has put me oot of aw temper   plaus he is very positive indeed sir pertinax and no doubt was intemperate and rude  but sir pertinax i would not break off the match notwithstanding for certainly even without the boroughs it is a very advantageous bargain to you and your son   sir pert but zoons plausible do you think i will gee up the nomineetion till three boroughs why i would rather gee him twenty aw thirty thoosand pounds in any either point of the bargain especially at this juncture when votes are likely to become invaluable why mon if a certain affair comes on they will rise above five hundred per cent   plaus you judge very rightly sir pertinax but what shall we do in this case for mr sergeant insists that you positively agreed to my lords having the nomination to the three boroughs during his own life   sir pert why yes in the first sketch of the agreement i believe i did consent but at that time mon my lords affairs did not appear to be half so desperate ass i now find they turn oot  sir he must be acqueese in whatever i demand  for i hai gotten him into sic an hobble that he canno exeest without me   plaus no doubt sir pertinax you have him absolutely in your power   sir pert vary weel and ought not a mon to make his vantage of it   plaus no doubt you ought  no matter of doubt  but sir pertinax there is a secret spring in this business that you do not seem to perceive and which i am afraid governs the matter respecting these boroughs   sir pert what spring do you mean counselor   plaus why sergeant eitherside i have some reason to think that my lord is tied down by some means or other to bring the sergeant in the very first vacancy for one of those boroughs  now that i believe is the sole motive why the sergeant is so very strenuous that my lord should keep the boroughs in his own power fearing that you might reject him for some man of your own   sir pert odds wounds and deeth plausible  ye are cleever  deevilish cleever  by the blood ye hai hit upon the vary streeng that hais made aw this discord  i see it  i see it now  but haud  haud  bide a we bit  a we bit mon  i hai a thought come in till my head  yas i think noow plausible we a little care in our negotiation that this vary string properly tuned may be still made to produce the harmony we wish for yes yes i hai it this sergeant i see understonds business and if i am not mistaken knows how till take a hint   plaus o nobody better sir pertinax  nobody better   sir pert why then plausible the short road is always the best we sie a mon ye must even come up to his mark at yeance and assure him frae me that i weell secure him a seat for yean of these vary boroughs   plaus o that will do sir pertinax  that will do i will answer for it   sir pert and further i beg ye weell let him know that i think myself obliged till conseeder him in this affair ass acting for me ass weell ass for my lord ass a common friend till both and for the service he has already done us make my special compliments till him and pray let this amiacable bit of paper be my faithful advocate till convince him of what my gratitude further intends for his great gives a bank bill equity in adjusting this agreement betweext my lords family and mine   plaus ha ha ha sir pertinax upon my word this is noble  ay ay this is an eloquent bit of paper indeed   sir pert master plausible in aw human dealings the most effectual method is that of ganging at yeance till the vary bottom of a mons heart for if we expact that men should serve us we must first win their affections by serving them  oh here they both come   enter enter lord lumbercourt and sergeant eitherside l lum my dear sir pertinax what could provoke you to break off this business so abruptly you are really wrong in the point and if you will give yourself time to recollect you will find that my having the nomination to the boroughs for my life was a preliminary article  and i appeal to mr sergeant eitherside here whether i did not always understand so   serj either i assure you sir pertinax that in all his lordships conversation with me upon this business and in his positive instructions both he and i always understood the nomination to be in my lord durante vitae   sir pert why then my lord to shorten the dispute all i can say in answer to your lordship is that there has been a total mistake between us in that point and therefore the treaty must end here  i give it up  oh i wash my hands of it for ever   plaus well but gentlemen gentlemen a little patience  sure this mistake somehow or other may be rectified mr sergeant prithee let you and i step into the next room by ourselves and reconsider the clause relative to the boroughs and try if we cannot hit upon a medium that will be agreeable to both parties   serj either with great warmth mr plausible i have considered the clause fully and am entirely master of the question my lord cannot give up the point without an equivalent   plaus sir pertinax will you permit mr sergeant and me to retire a few moments to reconsider the points   sir pert we all my heart and saul master plausible  ainy thing till accommodate your lordship ainy thing  ainy thing   plaus what say you my lord   l lum nay i submit it entirely to you and mr sergeant   plaus come mr sergeant let us retire   l lum ay ay go mr sergeant and hear what mr plausible has to say however   serj either nay i will wait on mr plausible my lord with all my heart but i am sure i cannot suggest the shadow of a reason for altering my present opinion  impossible  impossible   plaus well well do not be positive mr sergeant do not be positive  i am sure reason and your clients convenience will always make you alter your opinion   serj either ay ay reason and my clients convenience mr plausible will always control my opinion depend upon it  ay ay there you are right  sir i attend you exeunt lawyers   sir pert i am sorry my lord extremely sorry indeed that this mistake has happened   l lum upon my honor so am i sir pertinax   sir pert but come now  after all your lordship must allow ye hai been in the wrong come my dear lord you must allow that now   l lum how so  my dear sir pertinax   sir pert not aboot the boroughs my lord for those i do not mind a bawbee but aboot your distrust of my friendship why do you think now i appeal to your ain breast my lord do you think my lord that i should ever hai refused or slighted your lordships nomination to these boroughs   l lum why really i dont think you would sir pertinax but we must be directed by our lawyers you know   sir pert hah my lord lawyers are a dangerous species of animals till hai depandence on  they are awways starting punctilios and diffeecultys among friends why my dear lord it is their interest that aw mankind should be at variance for disagreement is the vary manure we which they enrich and fatten the land of leeteegation and as they find that that constantly promotes the best crop depend upon it they will always be sure to lay it on as thick as they can   l lum come come my dear sir pertinax you must not be angry with mr sergeant for his insisting so strongly on this point  for those boroughs you know are my sheet anchor   sir pert i know it my lord  and as an instance of my promptness to study and my acquiescence till your lordships inclinations ass i see that this sergeant eitherside wishes you weell and ye him i think now he would be as good a mon to be returned for yean of these boroughs ass could be pitched upon and ass such i humbly recommend him to your lordships consideration   l lum why my dear sir pertinax to tell you the truth i have already promised him  he must be in for one of them and that is one reason why i insisted so strenuously  he must be in   sir pert and why not  odzoons why not  is nai your word a fiat and wall it not be always so to me  are ye nai my friend  my patron  and are we nai by this match of our cheeldren to be united intill one interest   l lum so i understand it i own sir pertinax   sir pert my lord it can be no otherwise  then for heavens sake as your lordship and i can have but one interest for the future let us hai nai mare words aboot these paltry boroughs but conclude the agreement at yeance just as it stands otherwise there must be new writings drawn new consultation of lawyers new objections and delays will arise creditors will be impatient and impertinant so that we shall nai finish the lord knows when   l lum you are right  you are right  say no more mac  say no more  split the lawyers  you judge the point better than all westminster hall could  it shall stand as it is  yes it shall be settled your own way for your interest and mine are the same i see plainly   sir pert no doubt of it my lord   l lum o here the lawyers come  so gentlemen  well what have ye done  how are your opinions now   enter plausible and sergeant eitherside serj either my lord mr plausible has convinced me  fully convinced me   plaus yes my lord i have convinced him  i have laid such arguments before mr sergeant as were irresistible   serj either he has indeed my lord  besides as sir pertinax gives his honor that your lordships nomination shall be sacredly observed why upon a nearer review of the whole affair i think it will be the wiser measure to conclude the agreement just as it is drawn   l lum i am very glad you think so mr sergeant because that is my opinion too  so my dear eitherside do you and plausible dispatch the business now as soon as possible   serj either my lord every thing will be ready for signing in less than an hour come mr plausible let us go and fill up the blanks and put the last hand to the writings on our part   plaus i attend you mr sergeant   exeunt lawyers l lum and while the lawyers are preparing the writings sir pertinax i will go and saunter with the women   sir pert do  do my lord  and i wull come till you presently   l lum very well my dear mac  i shall expect you exit singing sons of care   sir pert alone so a leetle flattery mixed we the finesse of a gilded promise on one side and a quantum sufficit of the aurum palpabile on the other hai at last made me the happiest father in great breetain  hah my heart expands itself as it were through every part of my whole body at the completion of this buseeness and feels nothing but dignity and elevation  haud  haud  bide a we bide a we i hai yean leetle maiter mair in this affair till adjust and then sir pertinax ye may dictate till fortune hersel and send her till govern feuls while ye show and convince the world that wisemen awways govern her  whas there    enter footman sir pert tell my son egerton i waid speak wi him here in the library  exit footman  now i hai settled the grand point we my lord this i think is the proper juncture till feel the poleetical pulse of my spark and yeance for aw till set it to the exact measure that i would hai it constantly beat  enter egerton come hither chairles   egert your pleasure sir   sir pert aboot two hoors since i told you chairles that i received this letter express complaining of your brothers acteevety at an election in the north against a particular friend of mine which has given great offense and sir ye are mentioned in the letter as well as he to be plain i must roundly tell you that upon this interview depends my happiness ass a man and a faither and my affection till ye sir as a son for the remainder of our days   egert i hope sir i shall never do any thing either to forfeit your affection or disturb your happiness   sir pert i hope so too  but to the point  the fact is this  there has been a motion made this very day to bring on the grand affair which is settled for friday sennight  noow sir ass ye are popular hai talents and are weel heard it is expected and i insist on it that ye endeavor till atone for your past misconduct by preparing and taking a large share in that question and supporting it we aw your power   egert sir i have always divided as you directed except on one occasion  never voted against your friends only in that affair but sir i hope you will not so exert your influence as to insist upon my supporting a measure by an obvious prostituted sophistry in direct opposition to my character and to my own conscience   sir pert conscience why ye are mad  did ye ever hear any mon talk of conscience in poleetical maiters  conscience quotha  i have been in parliament these three and thraty years and never heard the term made use of before  sir it is an unparliamentary word and ye weel be laughed at for it  therefore i desire ye wull not offer till impose upon me we such phantoms but let me know your reason for thus slighting my friends and disobeying my commands  sir give me an immediate and precise answer   egert then sir i must frankly tell you that you work against my nature you would connect me with men i despise and press me into measures i abhor would make me a devoted slave to selfish leaders who have no friendship but in faction no merit but in corruption nor interest in any measure but their own and to such men i cannot submit  for know sir that the malignant ferment which the venal ambition of the times provokes in the heads and hearts of other men i detest   sir pert what are you aboot sir malignant ferment and venal ambition every mon should be ambeetious till serve his country and every mon should be rewarded for it  and pray sir would ye not weesh to serve your country i say sir would ye not weesh to serve your country   egert only show me how i may serve my country and my life is here is were i qualified to lead her armies to steer her fleets and deal her honest vengeance on her insulting foes or could my eloquence pull down a state leviathan mighty with the plunder of his country black with the treasons of her disgrace and send his infamy down to a free posterity as a monumental terror to corrupt ambition i would be foremost in such service and act it with the unremitting ardour of a roman spirit   sir pert vary weel sir  the fellow is beside himself   egert but to be a common barker at envied power to beat the drum of faction and sound the trumpet of insidious patriotism  only to displace a rival  or to be a servile voter in proud corruptions filthy train to market out my voice my reason and my trust to the party broker who best can promise or pay for prostitution  these sir are services my nature abhors  for they are such a malady to every kind of virtue as must in time destroy the fairest constitution that ever wisdom framed or virtuous liberty fought for   sir pert why ye are mad sir  ye hai certainly been bit by some mad whig or other  ah ye are vary young  vary young in these matters but experience wull convince you sir that every man in public business has two consciencees a releegious and a poleetical conscience why you see a merchant noow or a shopkeeper or a lawyer that kens the science of the world awways luocks upon an oath in a customhouse or behind a coounter or in a chancery suit only ass an oath in business a thing of course a mere thing of course that hais naithing till do we releegion and just so it is at an election  for instance noow  i am a candidate pray observe  and i gang till a perreewigmaker a hatter or a hosier and i give him ten twenty or thraty guineas for a perreewig hat or a pair of hose so on through a majority of votes  vary weel what is the consequence why this you see begets a commercial intercourse begets friendship betwixt us and in a day or two these men gang and give me their suffrages  noow pray sir can ye or any lawyer divine or casuist caw this a bribe hai sir in fair poleetical reasoning it is ainly generosity on the ain side and gratitude on the other  so sir let me hai nai mair of your releegious or philosophical refinements but prepare attend and speak to the question or ye are nai son of mine sir i insist on it   enter sam sam sir my lord says the writings are now ready and his lordship and the lawyers are waiting for you and mr egerton   sir pert vary weel  well attend his lordship  exit sam  i tell you chairles aw this conscientious refinement in poleetics is downright ignorance and impracticable romance and sir i desire i may hear no more of it come sir let us gang done and dispatch the business  going is stopped by egerton   egert sir with your permission i beg you will first hear me a word or two upon this subject   sir pert weell sir what waid ye say   egert i have often resolved to let you know my aversion to this match   sir pert how sir   egert but my respect and fear of disobliging you sir kept me silent   sir pert your aversion  your aversion sir  how dare ye use sic language to me your aversion luock you sir i shall cut the maitter short  conseeder my fortune is nai inheritance it is aw my ain acqueeseetion  i can make ducks and drakes of it  so do not provoke me but sign the articles directly   egert i beg your pardon sir but i must be free on this occasion and tell you at once that i can no longer dissemble the honest passion that fills my heart for another woman   sir pert hoow another woman and you villain how dare you love another woman weethout my leave but what other woman what is she speak sir  speak    egert constantia   sir pert constantia o ye profligate what a creature taken in for charity   egert her poverty is not her crime sir but her misfortune her birth is equal to the noblest and virtue though covered with a village garb is virtue still and of more worth to me than all the splendour of ermined pride or redundant wealth and therefore sir    sir pert haud your jaubbering ye villain  haud your jaubbering  none of your romance or refinement till me  i hai but yean question to ask ye  but yean question and then hai done we ye for ever  for ever  therefore think before ye answer  we will ye marry the lady or we will ye break my heart   egert sir my presence shall not offend you any longer  but when reason and reflection take their turn i am sure you will not be pleased with yourself for this unpaternal passion going away   sir pert tarry i command ye  and i command ye likewise not to stir till ye hai given me an answer a definitive answer wull you marry the lady or wull ye not   egert since you
