this volume see titlepage on recto of this leaf james roberts was the son of robert roberts a printer see ms register of freemen of stationers company for   nov      and possibly a descendant of the james roberts who printed several shakespeare quartos this ancestry is indicated by the identity of name and trade—doubly significant considering the possibilities then of family succession in these matters the later james was admitted a freeman of the stationers company   nov      and clothed   july      ms court book of stationers company     –   f     he became under warden in      and

eighteenth century ed      iii     and was buried   nov      in the church of st martin ludgate by the parish register from his career it is evident that his contemporaries thought him one of the great printers of his generation and his books substantiate their judgement his printing ranks with the finest of his age among imposing volumes which should apparently be credited to him are the original editions of popes odyssey and shakespeare garths ovid      priors poems on several occasions      and gays fables      that roberts printed these books is shown by the complete identity of certain ornaments in them with those in books whose printing is ascribed to roberts on the titlepage as a publisher roberts issued first editions for pope fielding steele defoe prior swift young congreve addison lord hervey and dr johnson in addition he was a copious publisher of pamphlets with a leaning towards unorthodox ones that he printed often for tonson if the evidence of ornaments is to be trusted and alternated with tonson in the publication of the various editions of the fable indicates close business relations between the two men roberts published and printed for mandeville according to titlepage all the separate editions of part ii of the fable the    0 free thoughts the executions at tyburn and the letter to dion and published the      editions of the fable and the mischiefs that ought justly to be apprehended from a whiggovernment both editions if the evidence of the ornaments can be trusted he also printed all the octavo editions of the first part of the fable after      up to and including that of      they contain ornaments identical with those in part ii of the fables the origin of honour which shares cuts with the letter to dion and the    0 treatise of the hypochondriack and hysterick diseases which contains the same ornaments as the octavo editions of the fable   it h e preface considering the manifold clamours that have been raisd from several quarters against the fable of the bees even after i had publishd the vindication of it many of my readers will wonder to a see me come out with a second part before i have taken any further notice of what has been said against the first whatever is publishd i take it for granted is submitted to the judgment of all the world that see it but it is very unreasonable that authors should not be upon the same footing with their criticks the treatment i have receivd and the liberties some iigentlemen have taken with me being well known the publick must be convinced before now that in point of civility i owe my adversaries nothing and if those who have taken upon them to school and reprimand me had an undoubted right to censure what they thought fit without asking my leave and to say of me what they pleasd i ought to have an equal privilege to examine their censures   and without consulting them to judge in my turn whether they are worth answering or not the publick must be the umpire between us from the appendix that has been added to the first part ever since the third edition it is manifest that i have been far from endeavouring to stifle either the arguments or the invectives that were made against me and not to have left the reader uninformd of any thing extant of either sort i once thought to have taken this opportunity of presenting him with a list of the adversaries that have appeared in print against me  but as they are in nothing so considerable as they are in their numbers i was afraid it would have lookd like ostentation unless i would have answered them all which i shall never attempt the reason therefore of my obstinate silence has been all along that hitherto i have not been accused of any thing that is criminal or immoral for which every middling capacity could not have framed a very good answer from some part or other either of the vindication or the book it self iiihowever i have wrote and had by me near two years a defence of the fable of the bees   in which i have stated and endeavourd to solve all the objections that might reasonably be made against it as to the doctrine containd in it and the detriment it might be of to others for this is the only thing about which i ever had any concern being conscious that i have   wrote with no ill design   should be sorry to lye under the imputation of it but as to the goodness or badness of the performance it self the thought was never worth my care and therefore those criticks that found fault with my bad reasoning and said of the book that it is ill wrote that there is nothing new in it that it is incoherent stuff that the language is barbarous the humour low and the style mean and pitiful those criticks i say are all very wellcome to say what they please in the main i believe they are in the right but if they are not i shall never give my self the trouble to contradict them for i never think an author more foolishly employd than when he is vindicating his own abilities as i wrote it for my diversion so i have had my ends if those who read it have not had theirs i am sorry for it tho i think my self not at all answerable for the disappointment it was not wrote by subscription nor have i ever warranted any where what use or goodness it would be of on the contrary in the very preface i have called it an inconsiderable trifle and since that i have publickly ivownd that it was a rhapsody  if people will buy books without looking into them or knowing what they are i cant see whom they have to blame but themselves when they dont answer expectation besides it is no new thing for people to dislike books after they have bought them this will happen sometimes even when men of considerable figure had given them the strongest assurances before hand that they would be pleasd with them a considerable part of the defence i mentiond has been seen by several of my friends who have been in expectation of it for some time i have stayd neither for types nor paper and yet i have several reasons why i do not yet publish it which having touchd no bodys money nor made any promise concerning it i beg leave to keep to my self most of my adversaries   whenever it comes out will think it soon enough and no body suffers by the delay but my self since i was first attackd it has long been a matter of wonder and perplexity to me to find out why and how men should conceive that i had wrote with an intent to debauch the nation and promote all manner of vice and it was a great while before i could derive the charge from any thing but wilful mistake and premeditated malice but since i have seen that men could be serious in apprehending the encrease of rogues and robberies from the frequent representations of the beggars opera  i am pervsuaded that there really are such wrongheads in the world as will fancy vices to be encouraged when they see them exposd to the same perverseness of judgment it must have been owing that some of my adversaries were highly incensd with me for having ownd in the vindication that hitherto i had not been able to conquer my vanity as well as i could have wishd  from their censure it is manifest that they must have imagind that to complain of a frailty was the same as to brag of it but if these angry gentlemen had been less blinded with passion or seen with better eyes they would easily have perceivd unless they were too well pleasd with their pride that to have made the same confession themselves they wanted nothing but sincerity whoever boasts of his vanity and at the same time shews his arrogance is unpardonable but when we hear a man complain of   an infirmity and his want of power entirely to cure it whilst he suffers no symptoms of it to appear that we could justly upbraid him with we are so far from being offended that we are pleasd with the ingenuity and applaud his candor and when such an author takes no greater liberties with his readers than what is usual in the same manner of writing and owns that to be the result of vanity which others tell a thousand lies about his confession is a compliment and the frankness of it ought not to be lookd upon otherwise than as a civility to the publick a condescenvision he was not obliged to make it is not in feeling the passions or in being affected with the frailties of nature that vice consists but in indulging and obeying the call of them contrary to the dictates of reason whoever pays great deference to his readers respectfully submitting himself to their judgment and tells them at the same time that he is entirely destitute of pride whoever i say does this spoils his compliment whilst he is making of it for it is no better than bragging that it costs him nothing persons of taste and the least delicacy can be but little affected with a mans modesty of whom they are sure that he is wholly void of pride within the absence of the one makes the virtue of the other cease at least the merit of it is not greater than that of chastity in an eunuch or humility in a beggar what glory would it be to the memory of cato that he refused to touch the water that was brought him if it was not supposed that he was very thirsty when he did it  the reader will find that in this second part i have endeavoured to illustrate and explain several things that were obscure and only hinted at in the first whilst i was forming this design i found on the one hand that as to my self the easiest way of executing it would be by dialogue but i knew on the other that to discuss   opinions and manage controversies it is counted the most unfair manner of writing when partial men viihave a mind to demolish an adversary and triumph over him with little expence it has long been a frequent practice to attack him with dialogues in which the champion who is to lose the battel appears at the very beginning of the engagement to be the victim that is to be sacrifised and seldom makes a better figure than cocks on shrovetuesday that receive blows but return none and are visibly set up on purpose to be knockd down  that this is to be said against dialogues is certainly true  but it is as true that there is no other manner of writing by which greater reputation has been obtaind those who have most excelld all others in it were the two most famous authors of all antiquity plato and cicero the one wrote almost all his philosophical works in dialogues and the other has left us nothing else it is evident then that the fault of those who have not succeeded in dialogues was in the management and not in the manner of writing and that nothing but the ill use that has been made of it could ever have brought it into disrepute the reason why plato preferr d dialogues to any other manner of writing he said was that things thereby might look as if they were acted rather than told the same was afterwards given by cicero in the same words rendred into his own language  the greatest objection that   in reality lies against it is the difficulty there is in writing them well the chief of platos interlocutors was always his master soviiicrates who every where maintains his character with great dignity but it would have been impossible to have made such an extraordinary person speak like himself on so many emergencies if plato had not been as great a man as socrates cicero who studyd nothing more than to imitate plato introduced in his dialogues some of the greatest men in rome his contemporaries that were known to be of different opinions and made them maintain and defend every one his own sentiments as strenuously and in as lively a manner as they could possibly have done themselves and in reading his dialogues a man may easily imagine himself to be in company with several learned men of different tastes and studies but to do this a man must have ciceros capacity lucian likewise and several others among the ancients chose for their speakers persons of known characters that this interests and engages the reader more than strange names is undeniable but then when the personages fall short of those characters it plainly shews that the author undertook what he was not able to execute to avoid this inconveniency most dialogue writers among the moderns have made use of fictitious names which they either invented themselves or borrowd of others these are generally speaking judicious compounds taken from the greek that serve for short characters of the imaginary persons they are given to denoting either the ixparty they side with or what it is they love or hate but of all these happy compounds there is not one that has appeard equally charming to so many authors of different views and talents as philalethes a plain demonstration of the great regard mankind generally have to truth there has not been a paperwar of note these two hundred years in which both parties at one time or other have not made use of this victorious champion who which side soever he has  0 fought on has hitherto like drydens almanzor  been conqueror and constantly carried all before him but as by this means the event of the battel must always be known as soon as the combatants are named and before a blow is struck and as all men are not equally peaceable in their dispositions many readers have complaind that they had not sport enough for their money and that knowing so much beforehand spoild all their diversion this humour having prevaild for some time authors are grown less sollicitous about the names of the personages they introduce this careless way seeming to me at least as reasonable as any other i have followd and had no other meaning by the names i have given my interlocutors than to distinguish them without the least regard to the derivation of the a words or any thing relating to the etymology of them all the care i have taken about them that i know of is that the pronunciation of them should not be harsh nor the sounds offensive xbut tho the names i have chosen are feignd and the circumstances of the persons fictitious the characters themselves are real and as faithfully copied from nature as i have been able to take them i have known criticks find fault with playwrights for annexing short characters to the names they gave the persons of the drama alledging that it is forestalling their pleasure and that whatever the actors are represented to be they want no monitor and are wise enough to find it out themselves but i could never approve of this censure there is a satisfaction i think in knowing ones company and when i am to converse with people for a considerable time i desire to be well acquainted with them and the sooner the better it is for this reason i thought it proper to give the reader some account of the persons that are to entertain him as they are supposed to be people of    quality i beg leave before i come to particulars to premise some things concerning the beau monde in general which tho most people perhaps know them every body does not always attend to among the fashionable part of mankind throughout christendom there are in all countries persons who tho they feel a just abhorrence to atheism and professd infidelity yet have very little religion and are scarce halfbelievers when their lives come to be lookd into and their sentiments examind what is chiefly aimd at in a refined education is to procure as much ease and pleasure upon earth as xithat can afford therefore men are first instructed in all the various arts of rendring their behaviour agreeable to others with the least disturbance to themselves secondly they are imbued with the knowledge of all the elegant comforts of life as well as the lessons of human prudence to avoid pain and trouble in order to enjoy as much of the world and with as little opposition as it is possible whilst thus men study their own private interest in assisting each other to promote and encrease the pleasures of life in general they find by experience that to compass those ends every thing ought to be banishd from conversation that can have the least tendency of making others uneasy and to reproach men with their faults or imperfections neglects or omissions or to put them in mind of their duty are offices that none are allowd to take upon them but parents or professd masters and tutors nor even they before company but to reprove and pretend to teach others we have no authority over is ill manners even in a clergyman out of the pulpit nor is he there to talk magisterially or ever to mention things that are melancholly or dismal if he would pass for a polite preacher but whatever we may vouchsafe to hear at church neither the certainty of a future state nor the necessity of repentance nor any thing else relating to the essentials of christianity are ever to be talkd of when we are out of it among the beau monde upon    any account whatever the xiisubject is not diverting besides every body is supposed to know those things and to take care accordingly nay it is unmannerly to think otherwise the decency in fashion being the chief if not the only rule all modish people walk by not a few of them go to church and receive the sacrament from the same principle that obliges them to pay visits to one another and now and then to make an entertainment but as the greatest care of the beau monde is to be agreeable and appear wellbred so most of them take particular care and many against their consciences not to seem burdend with more religion than it is fashionable to have for fear of being thought to be either hypocrites or bigots virtue however is a very fashionable word and some of the most luxurious are extremely fond of the amiable sound tho they mean nothing by it but a great veneration for whatever is courtly or sublime and an equal aversion to every thing that is vulgar or unbecoming they seem to imagine that it chiefly consists in a strict compliance to the rules of politeness and all the laws of honour that have any regard to the respect that is due to themselves it is the existence of this virtue that is often maintaind with so much pomp of words and for the eternity of which so many champions are ready to take up arms whilst the votaries of it deny themselves no pleasure they can enjoy either fashionably or in secret and instead xiiiof sacrificing the heart to the love of real virtue can only condescend to abandon the outward deformity of vice for the satisfaction they receive from appearing to be wellbred it is counted ridiculous for men to commit violence upon themselves or to maintain that virtue requires selfdenial  all courtphilosophers are agreed that nothing can be lovely or desirable that is mortifying or uneasy a civil behaviour among the fair in publick and a deportment inoffensive both in words and actions is all the chastity the polite world requires in men what    liberties soever a man gives himself in private his reputation shall never suffer whilst he conceals his amours from all those that are not unmannerly inquisitive and takes care that nothing criminal can ever be proved upon him si non castè saltem cautè is a precept that sufficiently shews what every body expects and tho incontinence is ownd to be a sin yet never to have been guilty of it is a character which most single men under thirty would not be fond of even amongst modest women as the world every where in compliment to itself desires to be counted really virtuous so barefacd vices and all trespasses committed in sight of it are heinous and unpardonable to see a man drunk in the open street or any serious assembly at noonday is shocking because it is a violation of the laws of decency and plainly shews a want of respect and nexivglect of duty which every body is supposed to owe to the publick men of mean circumstances likewise may be blamed for spending more time or money in drinking than they can afford but when these and all worldly considerations are out of the question drunkenness itself as it is a sin an offence to heaven is seldom censured and no man of fortune scruples to own that he was at such a time in such a company where a they drank very hard where nothing is committed that is either beastly or otherwise extravagant societies that meet on purpose to drink and be merry reckon their manner of passing away the time as innocent as any other tho most days in the year they spend five or six hours of the four and twenty in that diversion no man had ever the reputation of being a good companion that would never drink to excess and if a mans constitution be so strong or himself so cautious that the dose he takes overnight never disorders him the next day the worst that shall be said of him is that he loves his bottle with moderation tho every night constantly he makes drinking his pastime and hardly ever goes to bed entirely sober    avarice it is true is generally detested but as men may be as guilty of it by scraping money together as they can be by hoarding it up so all the base the sordid and unreasonable means of acquiring wealth ought to be equally condemnd and exploded with the vile the pitiful xvand penurious ways of saving it but the world is more indulgent no man is taxd with avarice that will conform with the beau monde and live every way in splendour tho he should always be raising the rents of his estate and hardly suffer his tenants to live under him tho he should enrich himself by usury and all the barbarous advantages that extortion can make of the necessities of others and tho moreover he should be a bad paymaster himself and an unmerciful creditor to the unfortunate it is all one no man is counted covetous who entertains well and will allow his family what is fashionable for a person in his condition how often do we see men of very large estates unreasonably sollicitous after greater riches what greediness do some men discover in extending the perquisites of their offices what dishonourable condescensions are made for places of profit what slavish attendance is given and what low submissions and unmanly cringes are made to favorites for pensions by men that could subsist without them yet these things are no reproach to men and they are never upbraided with them but by their enemies or those that envy them and perhaps the discontented and the poor on the contrary most of the wellbred people that live in affluence themselves will commend them for their diligence and activity and say of them that they take care of the main chance that they are industrious men xvifor their families and that they know how and are fit to live in the world but these kind constructions are not more hurtful to the practice of christianity than the high opinion which in an artful education men are taught to have of their species is to the belief of its doctrine if a right use be not made of it that the great preeminence we    have over all other creatures we are acquainted with consists in our rational faculty is very true but it is as true that the more we are taught to admire ourselves the more our pride encreases and the greater stress we lay on the sufficiency of our reason for as experience teaches us that the greater and the more transcendent the esteem is which men have for their own worth the less capable they generally are to bear injuries without resentment so we see in like manner that the more exalted the notions are which men entertain of their better part their reasoning faculty the more remote and averse theyll be from giving their assent to any thing that seems to insult over or contradict it and asking a man to admit of any thing he cannot comprehend the proud reasoner calls an affront to human understanding but as ease and pleasure are the grand aim of the beau monde and civility is inseparable from their behaviour whether they are believers or not so wellbred people never quarrel with the religion they are brought up in theyll xviireadily comply with every ceremony in divine worship they have been used to and never dispute with you either about the old or the new testament if in your turn youll forbear laying great stress upon faith and mysteries and allow them to give an allegorical or any other figurative sense to the history of the creation and whatever else they cannot comprehend or account for by the light of nature i am far from believing that among the fashionable people there are not in all christian countries many persons of stricter virtue and greater sincerity in religion than i have here described but that a considerable part of mankind have a great resemblance to the picture i have been drawing i appeal to every knowing and candid reader horatio cleomenes and fulvia are the names i have given to my interlocutors the first represents one of the modish people i have been speaking of but rather of the better sort of them as to morality tho he seems to have a greater distrust of    the sincerity of clergymen than he has of that of any other profession and to be of the opinion which is expressd in that trite and specious as well as false and injurious saying priests of all religions are the same as to his studies he is supposd to be tolerably well versd in the classicks and to have read more than is usual for people of quality that are born to great estates he is a man of strict honour and of xviiijustice as well as humanity rather profuse than covetous and altogether disinterested in his principles he has been abroad seen the world and is supposed to be possessd of the greatest part of the accomplishments that usually gain a man the reputation of being very much of a gentleman cleomenes had been just such another but was much reformd as he had formerly for his amusement only been dipping into anatomy and several parts of natural philosophy so since he was come home from his travels he had studyd human nature and the knowledge of himself with great application it is supposed that whilst he was thus employing most of his leisure hours he met with the fable of the bees and making a right use of what he read compared what he felt himself within as well as what he had seen in the world with the sentiments set forth in that book and found the insincerity of men fully as universal as it was there represented he had no opinion of the pleas and excuses that are commonly made to cover the real desires of the heart and he ever suspected the sincerity of men whom he saw to be fond of the world and with eagerness grasping at wealth and power when they pretended that the great end of their labours was to have opportunities of doing good to others upon earth and becoming themselves more thankful to heaven especially if they conformd with the beau xixmonde and seemd to take delight in a fashionable way of living he had the same suspicion of all men of sense who having read and considerd the gospel would maintain the possibility that persons might pursue worldly glory with all their    strength and at the same time be good christians cleomenes himself believd the bible to be the word of god without reserve and was entirely convinced of the mysterious as well as historical truths that are containd in it but as he was fully persuaded not only of the veracity of the christian religion but likewise of the severity of its precepts so he attackd his passions with vigor but never scrupled to own his want of power to subdue them or the violent opposition he felt from within often complaining that the obstacles he met with from flesh and blood were insurmountable as he understood perfectly well the difficulty of the task required in the gospel so he ever opposed those easy casuists that endeavourd to lessen and extenuate it for their own ends and he loudly maintaind that mens gratitude to heaven was an unacceptable offering whilst they continued to live in ease and luxury and were visibly sollicitous after their share of the pomp and vanity of this world in the very politeness of conversation the complacency with which fashionable people are continually soothing each others frailties and in almost every part of a gentlemans xxbehaviour he thought there was a disagreement between the outward appearances and what is felt within that was clashing with uprightness and sincerity cleomenes was of opinion that of all religious virtues nothing was more scarce or more difficult to acquire than christian humility and that to destroy the possibility of ever attaining to it nothing was so effectual as what is calld a gentlemans education and that the more dextrous by this means men grew in concealing the outward signs and every symptom of pride the more entirely they became enslaved by it within he carefully examind into the felicity that accrues from the applause of others and the invisible wages which men of sense and judicious fancy receivd for their labours and what it was at the bottom that rendred those airy rewards so ravishing to mortals he had often observed and watchd narrowly    the countenances and behaviour of men when any thing of theirs was admired or commended such as the choice of their furniture the politeness of their entertainments the elegancy of their equipages their dress their diversions or the fine taste displayd in their buildings cleomenes seemed charitable and was a man of strict morals yet he would often complain that he was not possessd of one christian virtue and found fault with his own actions that had all the appearances of goodness bexxicause he was conscious he said that they were performd from a wrong principle the effects of his education and his aversion to infamy had always been strong enough to keep him from turpitude but this he ascribed to his vanity which he complaind was in such full possession of his heart that he knew no gratification of any appetite from which he was able to exclude it having always been a man of unblameable behaviour the sincerity of his belief had made no visible alteration in his conduct to outward appearances but in private he never ceasd from examining himself as no man was less prone to enthusiasm than himself so his life was very uniform and as he never pretended to high flights of devotion so he never was guilty of enormous offences he had a strong aversion to rigorists of all sorts and when he saw men quarrelling about forms of creeds and the interpretation of obscure places and requiring of others the strictest compliance to their own opinions in disputable matters it raisd his indignation to see the generality of them want charity and many of them scandalously remiss in the plainest and most necessary duties he took uncommon pains to search into human nature and left no stone unturnd to detect the pride and hypocrisy of it and among his intimate friends to expose the stratagems of the one and the exorbitant power of the other he was sure that the satisfaction which arose xxiifrom worldly enjoyments was something distinct from gratitude and foreign to religion and he felt plainly that as it proceeded    from within so it centerd in himself the very relish of life he said was accompanied with an elevation of mind that seemd to be inseparable from his being whatever principle was the cause of this he was convinced within himself that the sacrifice of the heart which the gospel requires consisted in the utter extirpation of that principle confessing at the same time that this satisfaction he found in himself this elevation of mind caused his chief pleasure and that in all the comforts of life it made the greatest part of the enjoyment cleomenes with grief often ownd his fears that his attachment to the world would never cease whilst he lived the reasons he gave were the great regard he continued to have for the opinion of worldly men the stubborness of his indocile heart that could not be brought to change the objects of its pride and refused to be ashamed of what from his infancy it had been taught to glory in and lastly the impossibility he found in himself of being ever reconciled to contempt and enduring with patience to be laughd at and despised for any cause or on any consideration whatever these were the obstacles he said that hindered him from breaking off all commerce with the beau monde and entirely changing his manner of living withxxiiiout which he thought it mockery to talk of renouncing the world and bidding adieu to all the pomp and vanity of it the part of fulvia who is the third person is so inconsiderable she just appearing only in the first dialogue that it would be impertinent to trouble the reader with a character of her i had a mind to say some things on painting and operas which i thought might by introducing her be brought in more naturally and with less trouble than they could have been without her the ladies i hope will find no reason from the little she does say to suspect that she wants either virtue or understanding  0 as to the fable or what is supposed to have occasioned the first dialogue between horatio and cleomenes it is this horatio who had found great delight in my lord shaftsburys polite manner of writing his fine raillery and blending virtue with good manners was a great stickler for the social system and wonderd how cleomenes could be an advocate for such a book as the fable of the bees of which he had heard a very vile character from several quarters cleomenes who loved and had a great friendship for horatio wanted to undeceive him but the other who hated satyr was prepossessd and having been told likewise that martial courage and honour itself were ridiculd in that book he was very much exasperated against the author and his whole xxivscheme he had two or three times heard cleomenes discourse on this subject with others but would never enter into the argument himself and finding his friend often pressing to come to it he began to look coolly upon him and at last to avoid all opportunities of being alone with him till cleomenes drew him in by the stratagem which the reader will see he made use of as horatio was one day taking his leave after a short complimentary visit i should not wonder to see men of candor as well as good sense find fault with the manner in which i have chose to publish these thoughts of mine to the world there certainly is something in it which i confess i dont know how to justify to my own satisfaction that such a man as cleomenes having met with a book agreeable to his own sentiments should desire to be acquainted with the author of it has nothing in it that is improbable or unseemly but then it will be objected that whoever the interlocutors are it was i myself who wrote the dialogues and that it is contrary to all decency that a man should proclaim concerning his own work all that a friend of his perhaps might be allowd to say this is true and the best answer which i think can be made to it is that such an impartial man and such a lover of    truth as cleomenes is represented to be would be as cautious in speaking of his friends merit as he would be of his own it xxvmight be urgd likewise that when a man professes himself to be an authors friend and exactly to entertain the same sentiments with another it must naturally put every reader upon his guard and render him as suspicious and distrustful of such a man as he would be of the author himself but how good soever the excuses are that might be made for this manner of writing i would never have venturd upon it if i had not liked it in the famous gassendus  who by the help of several dialogues and a friend who is the chief personage in them has not only explaind and illustrated his system but likewise refuted his adversaries him i have followed and i hope the reader will find that whatever opportunity i have had by this means of speaking well of my self indirectly i had no design to make that or any other ill use of it as it is supposed that cleomenes is my friend and speaks my sentiments so it is but justice that every thing which he advances should be lookd upon and considerd as my own but no man in his senses would think that i ought to be equally responsible for every thing that horatio says who is his antagonist  if    ever he offers any thing that savours of libertinism or is otherwise exceptionable which cleomenes does not reprove him for in the best and most serious manner or to which he gives not the most satisfactory and convincing xxvianswer that can be made i am to blame otherwise not yet from the fate the first volume has met with i expect to see in a little time several things transcribd and cited from this in that manner by themselves without the replies that are made to them and so shewn to the world as my words and my opinion the opportunity of doing this will be greater in this book than it was in the former and should i always have fair play and never be attackd but by such adversaries as would make their quotations from me without artifice and use me with common honesty it would go a great way to the refuting of me and i should myself begin to suspect the truth of several things i have advanced and which hitherto i cant help believing a stroke made in this manner———which the reader will sometimes meet with in the following dialogues is a sign either of interruption when the person speaking is not sufferd to go on with what he was going to say or else of a pause during which something is supposed to be said or done not relating to the discourse as in this volume i have not alterd the subject on which a former known by the name of the fable of the bees was wrote and the same unbiassd method of searching after truth and enquiring into the nature    of man and society made use of in that is continued in this xxviii thought it unnecessary to look out for another title and being myself a great lover of simplicity and my invention none of the most fruitful the reader i hope will pardon the bald inelegant aspect and unusual emptiness of the title page here i would have made an end of my preface which i know very well is too long already but the world having been very grosly imposed upon by a false report that some months ago was very solemnly made and as industriously spread in most of the newspapers for a considerable time i think it would be an unpardonable neglect in me of the publick should i suffer them to remain in the error they were led into when i am actually addressing them and there is no other person from whom they can so justly expect to be undeceivd in the london eveningpost of saturday march       –  the following paragraph was printed in small italick at the end of the homenews on friday evening the first instant a gentleman well dressd appeared at the bonefire before st jamessgate  who declared himself the author of a book entituled the fable of the bees and that he was sorry for writing the same and recollecting his former promise  pronounced these words i commit my book to the flames and threw it in accordingly     xxviiithe monday following the same piece of news was repeated in the daily journal and after that for a considerable time as i have said in most of the papers  but since the saturday mentiond which was the only time it was printed by itself it appeard always with a small addition to it and annexd with a nb before it to the following advertisement a p e t hλ ο γ ι α or an enquiry into the original of moral virtue wherein the false notions of machiavel  hobbs spinosa and mr bayle  as they are collected and digested by the author of the fable of the bees are examined and confuted and the eternal and unalterable law of nature and obligation of moral    virtue is stated and vindicated to which is prefixed a prefatory introduction in a letter to that author by alexander innes d d preacherassistant at st margarets westminster     the small addition which i said was made to that notable piece of news after it came to be annexd to this advertisement consisted of these five words upon reading the above book which were put in after sorry for writing the same this story having been often repeated in the papers and never publickly contradicted many people it seems were credulous enough to believe notwithstanding the improbability of it xxixbut the least attentive would have suspected the whole as soon as they had seen the addition that was made to it the second time it was publishd for supposing it to be intelligible as it follows the advertisement it cannot be pretended that the repenting gentleman pronounced those very words he must have named the book and if he had said that his sorrow was occasiond by reading the apethλογια or the new book of the reverend dr innes how came such a remarkable part of his confession to be omitted in the first publication where the welldressd gentlemans words and actions seem to be set down with so much care and exactness besides every body knows the great industry and general intelligence of our newswriters if such a farce had really been acted and a man had been hired to pronounce the words mentiond and throw a book into the fire which i have often wonderd was not done is it credible at all that a thing so remarkable done so openly and before so many witnesses the first day of march should not be taken notice of in any of the papers before the ninth and never be repeated afterwards or ever mentiond but as an appendix of the advertisement to recommend dr inness book however this story has been much talkd of and occasiond a great deal of mirth among my acquaintance several of whom have earnestly pressd me more than once    to advertise the falxxxsity of it which i would never comply with for fear of being laughd at as some years ago poor dr patridge   was for seriously maintaining that he was not dead but all this while we were in the dark and no body could tell how this report came into the world or what it could be that had given a handle to it when one evening a friend of mine who had borrowd dr inness book which till then i had never seen shewd me in it the following lines but à propos sir if i rightly remember the ingenious mr law in his remarks upon your fable of the bees puts you in mind of a promise you had made by which you obligd yourself to burn that book at any time or place your adversary should appoint if any thing should be found in it tending to immorality or the corruption of manners  i have a great respect for that gentleman tho i am not personally acquainted with him but i cannot but condemn his excessive credulity and good nature in believing that a man of your principles could be a slave to his word for my own part i think i know you too well to be so easily imposed upon or if after all you should really persist in your resolution and commit it to the    flames i appoint the first of march before st jamess gate for that purpose it being the birthday of the best xxxiand most glorious queen upon earth  and the burning of your book the smallest atonement you can make for endeavouring to corrupt and debauch his majestys subjects in their principles now sir if you agree to this i hope you are not so destitute of friends but that you may find some charitable neighbour or other who will lend you a helping hand and throw in the author at the same time by way of appendix the doing of which will in my opinion complete the solemnity of the day  i am not your patient but your most humble servant thus ends what in the a p e t hλ ο γ ι α doctor innes is pleased to call a prefatory introduction in a letter to the author of the fable of the bees it is signed a i and dated tothillfields  westminster jan  0     –  now all our wonder ceasd the judicious reader will easily allow me that having read thus much i had an ample dispensation from going on any further therefore i can say nothing of the book and as to the reverend author of it who seems to think himself so well acquainted with my principles i have not the honour to know either him or his morals otherwise than from what i have quoted here ex pede herculem london octob  0     a    the first dialogue  the first dialogue between horatio cleomenes and fulvia c l e o m e n e s always in haste horatio hor i must beg of you to excuse me i am obligd to go cleo whether you have other engagements than you used to have or whether your temper is changd i cant tell but something has made an alteration in you of which i cannot comprehend the cause there is no man in the world whose friendship i value more than i do yours or whose company i like better yet i can never have it i profess i have thought sometimes that you have avoided me on purpose   hor i am sorry cleomenes i should have been wanting in civility to you i come every week constantly to pay my respects to you and if ever i fail i always send to enquire after your health  0 cleo no man outdoes horatio in civility but i thought something more was due to our affections and long acquaintance besides compliments and ceremony of late i have never been to wait upon you but you are gone abroad or i find you engaged and when i have the honour to see you here your stay is only momentary pray pardon my rudeness for once what is it that hinders you now from keeping me company for an hour or two my cousin talks of going out and i shall be all alone hor i know better than to rob you of such an opportunity for speculation cleo speculation on what pray hor that vileness of our species in the refind way of thinking you have of late been so fond of i call it the scheme of deformity the partizans of which study chiefly to make every thing in our nature appear as ugly and contemptible as it is possible and take uncommon pains to perswade men that they are devils cleo if that be all i shall soon convince you hor no conviction to me i beseech you i am  determind and fully persuaded that there is good in the world as well as evil and that the words honesty benevolence and humanity and even charity are not empty sounds only but that there are such things in spight of the fable of the bees and i am resolved to believe that notwithstanding the degeneracy of mankind and the wickedness of the age there are men now living who are actually possessd of those virtues cleo but you dont know what i am going to say i am— hor that may be but i will not hear one word all you can say is lost upon me and if you will not give me leave to speak out i am gone this moment that cursed book has bewitchd you and made you deny the existence of those very virtues that had    gaind you the esteem of your friends you know this is not my usual language i hate to say harsh thingsbut what regard can or ought one to have for an author that treats every body de haut en bas makes a jest of virtue and honour calls alexander the great a madman  and spares kings and princes no more than any one would the most abject of the people the business of his philosophy is just the reverse to that of the heralds office for as there they are always contriving and finding out high and illustrious pedigrees for low and obscure people so your author is ever searching after and inventing  mean contemptible origins for worthy and honourable actions i am your very humble servant cleo stay i am of your opinion what i offered to convince you of was how entirely i am recover d of the folly which you have so justly exposd i have left that error hor are you in earnest cleo no man more there is no greater stickler for the social virtues than my self and i much question whether there is any of lord shaftsburys  admirers that will go my lengths hor i shall be glad to see you go my lengths first and as many more as you please you cannot conceive cleomenes how it has grievd me when i have seen how many enemies you made yourself by that extravagant way of arguing if you are but serious whence comes this change cleo in the first place i grew weary of having every body against me and in the second there is more room for invention in the other system poets and orators in the social system have fine opportunities of exerting themselves hor i very much suspect the recovery you boast of are you convinced that the other system was    false which you might have easily learnd from seeing every body against you   cleo false to be sure but what you alledge is no proof of it for if the greatest part of mankind were not against that scheme of deformity as you justly call it insincerity could not be so general as the scheme itself supposes it to be but since my eyes have been opend i have found out that truth and probability are the silliest things in the world they are of no manner of use especially among the people de bon gout hor i thought what a convert you was but what new madness has seizd you now cleo no madness at all i say and will maintain it to the world that truth in the sublime is very impertinent and that in the arts and sciences fit for men of taste to look into a master cannot commit a more unpardonable fault than sticking to or being influencd by truth where it interferes with what is agreeable hor homely truths indeed cleo look upon that dutch piece of the nativity what charming colouring there is what a fine pencil and how just are the outlines for a piece so curiously finishd but what a fool the fellow was to draw hay and straw and cattle and a rack as well as a manger it is a wonder he did not put the bambino into the manger ful the bambino that is the child i suppose why it should be in the manger should it not does not the history tell us  that the child was laid in the manger i have no skill in painting but i can see whether things are drawn to the life or not sure nothing can be more like the head of an ox than that there a picture then pleases me best when the art in such a manner deceives my eye that without making any allowances i can imagine i see the things in reality which the painter has endeavourd to represent    i have always thought it an admirable piece sure nothing in the world can be more like nature cleo like nature so much the worse indeed cousin it is easily seen that you have no skill in painting it is not nature but agreeable nature la belle nature that is to be represented all things that are abject low pitiful and mean are carefully to be avoided and kept out of sight because to men of the true taste they are as offensive as things that are shocking and really nasty ful at that rate the virgin marys condition and our saviours birth are never to be painted cleo thats your mistake the subject it self is noble let us go but in the next room and ill shew you the difference—look upon that picture which is the same history theres fine architecture theres a colonnade can any thing be thought of more magnificent how skilfully is that  ass removed and how little you see of the ox pray mind the obscurity they are both placed in it hangs in a strong light or else one might look ten times upon the picture without observing them behold these pillars of the corinthian order how lofty they are and what an effect they have what a noble space what an area here is how nobly every thing concurs to express the majestick grandeur of the subject and strikes the soul with awe and admiration at the same time ful pray cousin has good sense ever any share in the judgment which your men of true taste form about pictures hor madam ful i beg pardon sir if i have offended but to me it seems strange to hear such commendation given to a painter for turning the stable of a country inn into a palace of extraordinary magnificence this is a great deal worse than swifts metamorphosis of    philemon and baucis for there some shew of resemblance is kept in the changes  hor in a country stable madam there is nothing but filth and nastiness or vile abject things not fit to be seen at least not capable of entertaining persons of quality ful the dutch picture in the next room has nothing that is offensive but an augean stable even before hercules had cleand it would be less shocking to me than those  fluted pillars for no body can please my eye that affronts my understanding when i desire a man to paint a considerable history which every body knows to have been transacted at a country inn does he not strangely impose upon me because he understands architecture to draw me a room that might have servd for a great hall or banquettinghouse to any roman emperor besides that the poor and abject state in which our saviour chose to appear at his coming into the world is the most material circumstance of the history it contains an excellent moral against vain pomp and is the strongest persuasive to humility which in the italian are more than lost hor indeed madam experience is against you and it is certain that even among the vulgar the representations of mean and abject things and such as they are familiar with have not that effect and either breed contempt or are insignificant whereas vast piles stately buildings roofs of uncommon height surprizing ornaments and all the architecture    of the grand taste are the fittest to raise devotion and inspire men with veneration and a religious awe for the places that have these excellencies to boast of is there ever a meetinghouse or barn to be compared to a fine cathedral for this purpose ful i believe there is a mechanical way of raising devotion in silly superstitious crea tures but an attentive contemplation on the works of god i am sure—— cleo pray cousin say no more in defence of your low taste the painter has nothing to do with the truth of the history his business is to express the dignity of the subject and in compliment to his judges never to forget the excellency of our species all his art and good sense must be employd in raising that to the highest pitch great masters dont paint for the common people but for persons of refind understanding what you complain of is the effect of the good manners and complaisance of the painter when he had drawn the infant and the madona he thought the least glimpse of the ox and the ass would be sufficient to acquaint you with the history they who want more fescuing and a broader explanation he dont desire his picture should ever be shewn to for the rest he entertains you with nothing but what is noble and worthy your attention you see he is an architect and compleatly skilld in perspective and he shews you how finely he can round a pillar and that both the depth and the height of space a may be drawn on a flat with all the other wonders he performs by his skill in that inconceivable mystery of light and shadows  0 ful why then is it pretended that painting is an imitation of nature cleo at first setting out a scholar is to copy things exactly as he sees them but from a great master    when he is left to his own invention it is expected he should take the perfections of nature and not paint it as it is but as we would wish it to be zeuxis to draw a goddess took five beautiful women from which he culld what was most graceful in each ful still every grace he painted was taken from nature cleo thats true but he left nature her rubbish and imitated nothing but what was excellent which made the assemblage superior to any thing in nature demetrius was taxd for being too natural dionysius was also blamed for drawing men like us nearer our times michael angelo was esteemd too natural and lysippus of old upbraided the common sort of sculptors for making men such as they were found in nature ful are these things real cleo you may read it your self in grahams preface to the art of painting   the book is above in the library hor these things may seem strange to you madam but they are of immense use to the publick the higher we can carry the excellency of our species the more those beautiful images will fill noble minds   with worthy and suitable ideas of their own dignity that will seldom fail of spurring them on to virtue and heroick actions there is a grandeur to be expressd in things that far surpasses the beauties of simple nature you take delight in operas madam i dont question you must have minded the noble    manner and stateliness beyond nature which every thing there is executed with what gentle touches what slight and yet majestick motions are made use of to express the most boisterous passions as the subject is always lofty so no posture is to be chosen but what is serious and significant as well as comely and agreeable should the actions there be represented as they are in common life they would ruin the sublime and at once rob you of all your pleasure ful i never expected any thing natural at an opera but as persons of distinction resort thither and every body comes dressd it is a sort of employment and i seldom miss a night because it is the fashion to go besides the royal family and the monarch himself generally honouring them with their presence it is almost become a duty to attend them as much as it is to go to court  what diverts me there is the company the lights the musick the scenes and other decorations but as i understand but very few words of italian so what   is most admired in the recitativo   is lost upon me which makes the acting part to me rather ridiculous than— hor ridiculous madam for heavens sake— ful i beg pardon sir for the expression i never laught at an opera in my life but i confess as to the entertainment it self that a good play is infinitely more diverting to me and i prefer any thing that informs my understanding beyond all the recreations    which either my eyes or my ears can be regald with  hor i am sorry to hear a lady of your good sense make such a choice have you no taste for musick madam ful i named that as part of my diversion cleo my cousin plays very well upon the harpsicord herself ful i love to hear good musick but it does not throw me into those raptures i hear others speak of hor nothing certainly can elevate the mind beyond a fine consort it seems to disengage the soul from the body and lift it up to heaven it is in this situation that we are most capable of receiving extraordinary impressions when the instruments cease our temper is subdued and beautiful action joyns with the skilful voice in setting before us in a transcendent light the heroick labours we are come to admire and which the word   opera imports the powerful harmony between the engaging sounds and speaking gestures invades the heart and forcibly inspires us with those noble sentiments which to entertain the most expressive words can only attempt to persuade us few comedies are tollerable and in the best of them if the levity of the expressions does not corrupt the meanness of the subject must debase the manners at least to persons of quality in tragedies the style is more sublime and the subjects generally great but all violent passions and even the representations of them ruffle and discompose the mind besides when men endeavour to express things strongly and they are acted to the life it    often happens that the images do mischief because they are too moving and that the action is faulty for being too natural and experience teaches us that in unguarded minds by those pathetick performances flames are often raisd that are prejudicial to virtue the playhouses themselves are far from being inviting much less the companies at least the greatest part of them that frequent them some of which are almost of the lowest rank of all the disgusts that persons of the least elegance receive from these people are many besides the ill scents and unseemly sights one meets with of careless rakes and impudent wenches that having paid their mony reckon themselves to be all upon the level with every bo  dy there the oaths scurrilities and vile jests one is often obliged to hear without resenting them and the odd mixture of high and low that are all partaking of the same diversion without regard to dress or quality are all very offensive and it cannot but be very disagreeable to polite people to be in the same crowd with a variety of persons some of them below mediocrity that pay no deference to one another at the opera every thing charms and concurs to make happiness compleat the sweetness of voice in the first place and the solemn composure of the action serve to mitigate and allay every passion it is the gentleness of them and the calm serenity of the mind that make us amiable and bring us the nearest to the perfection of angels whereas the violence of the passions in which the corruption of the heart chiefly consists dethrones our reason and renders us most like unto savages it is incredible how prone we are to imitation and how strangely unknown to ourselves we are shaped and fashioned after the models and examples that are often set before us no anger nor jealousy are ever to be seen at an opera that distort the features no flames that are noxious nor is any love represented in them that is not pure  0 and next to zeraphick and it is impossible for the remembrance to carry any thing away from them that can sully the imagination secondly the company   is of another sort the place it self is a security to peace as well as every ones honour and it is impossible to name another where blooming innocence and irresistible beauty stand in so little need of guardians here we are sure never to meet with petulancy or ill manners and to be free from immodest ribaldry libertine wit and detestable satyr if you will mind on the one hand the richness and splendour of dress and the quality of the persons that appear in them the variety of colours and the lustre of the fair in a spacious theatre well illuminated and adornd and on the a other the grave deportment of the assembly and the consciousness that appears in every countenance of the respect they owe to each other you will be forced to confess that upon earth there can not be a pastime more agreeable believe me madam there is no place where both sexes have such opportunities of imbibing exalted sentiments and raising themselves above the vulgar as they have at the opera and there is no other sort of diversion or assembly from the frequenting of which young persons of quality can have equal hopes of forming their manners and contracting a strong and lasting habit of virtue ful you have said more in commendation of operas horatio than i ever heard or thought of before and i think every body who loves that diversion is highly obliged   to you the grand gout i believe is a great help in panegyrick especially where it is an incivility strictly to examine and overcuriously to look into matters cleo what say you now fulvia of nature and good sense are they not quite beat out o doors ful i have heard nothing yet to make me out of    conceit with good sense tho what you insinuated of nature as if it was not to be imitated in painting is an opinion i must confess which hitherto i more admire at than i can approve of it hor i would never recommend any thing madam that is repugnant to good sense but cleomenes must have some design in overacting the part he pretends to have chosen what he said about painting is very true whether he spoke it in jest or in earnest but he talks so diametrically opposite to the opinion which he is known every where to defend of late that i dont know what to make of him ful i am convinced of the narrowness of my own understanding and am going to visit some persons with whom i shall be more upon the level hor youll give me leave to wait upon you to your coach madam—— —— ——pray cleomenes what is it you have got in your head cleo nothing at all i told you before that i was so entirely recoverd from my fol  ly that few people went my lengths what jealousy you entertain of me i dont know but i find my self much improvd in the social system formerly i thought that chief ministers and all those at the helm of affairs acted from principles of avarice and ambition that in all the pains they took and even in the slaveries they underwent for the publick good they had their private ends and that they were supported in the fatigue by secret enjoyments they were unwilling to own it is not a month ago that i imagind that the inward care and real sollicitude of all great men centerd within themselves and that to enrich themselves acquire titles of honour and raise their families on the one hand and to have opportunities on the other of displaying a judicious fancy in all the elegant comforts of life and establishing without the least trouble of selfdenial the reputation of being wise humane and munificent were the things    which besides the satisfaction there is in superiority and the pleasure of governing all candidates to high offices and great posts proposed to themselves from the places they sued for i was so narrowminded that i could not conceive how a man would ever voluntarily submit to be a slave but to serve himself but i have abandond that illnaturd way of judging i plainly perceive the publick good in all the designs of politicians the social virtues shine in   every action and i find that the national interest a is the compass that all statesmen steer by hor thats more than i can prove but certainly there have been such men there have been patriots that without selfish views have taken incredible pains for their countrys welfare nay there are men now that would do the same if they were employd and we have had princes that have neglected their ease and pleasure and sacrificed their quiet to promote the prosperity and encrease the wealth and honour of the kingdom and had nothing so much at heart as the happiness of their subjects cleo no disaffection i beg of you the difference between past and present times and persons in and out of places is perhaps clearer to you than it is to me but it is many years ago you know that it has been agreed between us never to enter into party disputes what i desire your attention to is my reformation which you seem to doubt of and the great change that is wrought in me the religion of most kings and other high potentates i formerly had but a slender opinion of but now i measure their piety by what they say of it themselves to their subjects hor thats very kindly done cleo by thinking meanly of things i once had strange blundering notions concerning foreign wars i thought that many of them   arose from trifling causes magnifyd by politicians for their own ends    that the most ruinous misunderstandings between states and kingdoms might spring from the hidden malice folly or caprice of one man that many of them had been owing to the private quarrels piques resentments and the haughtiness of the chief ministers of the respective nations that were the sufferers and that what is calld personal hatred between princes seldom was more at first than either an open or secret animosity which the two great favorites of those courts had against one another but now i have learnd to derive those things from higher causes i am reconciled likewise to the luxury of the voluptuous which i used to be offended at because now i am convinced that the money of most rich men is laid out with the social design of promoting arts and sciences and that in the most expensive undertakings their principal aim is the employment of the poor hor these are lengths indeed cleo i have a strong aversion to satyr and detest it every whit as much as you do the most instructive writings to understand the world and penetrate into the heart of man i take to be addresses epitaphs dedications and above all the preambles to patents of which i am making a large collection hor a very useful undertaking  0 cleo but to remove all your doubts of my conversion ill shew you some easy rules i have laid down for young beginners hor what to do cleo to judge of mens actions by the lovely system of lord shaftsbury in a manner diametrically opposite to that of the fable of the bees hor i dont understand you cleo you will presently i have calld them rules but they are rather examples from which the rules are to be gatherd as for instance if we see an industrious poor woman who has pinchd her belly    and gone in rags for a considerable time to save forty shillings part with her money to put out her son at six years of age to a chimneysweeper to judge of her charitably according to the system of the social virtues we must imagine that tho she never paid for the sweeping of a chimney in her life she knows by experience that for want of this necessary cleanliness the broth has been often spoyld and many a chimney has been set o fire and therefore to do good in her generation as far as she is able she gives up her all both offspring and estate to assist in preventing the several mischiefs that are often occasiond by great quantities of soot disregarded and free from selfishness sacrifices her only son to the most wretched employment for the publick welfare    hor you dont vy i see with lord shaftsbury for loftiness of subjects cleo when in a starry night with amazement we behold the glory of the firmament nothing is more obvious than that the whole the beautiful all must be the workmanship of one great architect of power and wisdom stupendious and it is as evident that every thing in the universe is a constituent part of one entire fabrick  hor would you make a jest of this too cleo far from it they are awful truths of which    i am as much convinced as i am of my own existence but i was going to name the consequences which lord shaftsbury draws from them in order to demonstrate to you that i am a convert and a punctuala observer of his lordships instructions and that in my judgment on the poor womans conduct there is nothing that is not entirely agreeable to the generous way of thinking set forth and recommended in the characteristicks  hor is it possible a man should read such a book and make no better use of it i desire you would name the consequences you speak of cleo as that infinity of luminous bodies however different in magnitude velocity and the figures they describe in their courses concur all of them to make up the universe so this little spot we inhabit is likewise a com  pound of air water fire minerals vegetables and living creatures which tho vastly differing from one another in their nature do altogether make up the body of this terraqueous globe    hor this is very right and in the same manner as our whole species is composed of many nations of different religions forms of government interests and manners that divide and share the earth between them so the civil society in every nation consists in great multitudes of both sexes that widely differing from each other in age constitution strength temper wisdom and possessions all help to make up one body politick cleo the same exactly which i would have said now pray sir is not the great end of mens forming themselves into such societies mutual happiness i mean do not all individual persons from being thus combined propose to themselves a more comfortable condition of life than human creatures if they were to live like other wild animals without tie or dependance could enjoy in a free and savage state hor this certainly is not only the end but the end which is every where attaind to by government and society in some degree or other cleo hence it must follow that it is always wrong for men to pursue gain or pleasure by means that are visibly detrimental to the ci  vil society and that creatures who can do this must be narrowsould shortsighted selfish people whereas wise men never look upon themselves as individual persons without considering the whole of which they are but trifling parts in respect to bulk and are incapable of receiving any satisfaction from things that interfere with the publick welfare this being undeniably true ought not all private advantage to give way to this general interest and ought it not to be every ones endeavour to encrease this common stock of happiness and in order to it do what he can to render himself a serviceable and useful member of that whole body which he belongs to hor what of all this cleo has not my poor woman in what i have    related of her acted in conformity to this social system hor can any one in his senses imagine that an indigent thoughtless wretch without sense or education should ever act from such generous principles cleo poor i told you the woman was and i wont insist upon her education but as for her being thoughtless and void of sense youll give me leave to say that it is an aspersion for which you have no manner of foundation and from the account i have given of her nothing can be gatherd but that she was   a considerate virtuous wise woman in poverty hor i suppose you would persuade me that you are in earnest cleo i am much more so than you imagine and say once more that in the example i have given i have trod exactly in my lord shaftsburys steps and closely followd the social system if i have committed any error shew it me hor did that author ever meddle with any thing so low and pitiful cleo there can be nothing mean in noble actions whoever the persons are that perform them but if the vulgar are to be all excluded from the social virtues what rule or instruction shall the labouring poor which are by far the greatest part of the nation have left them to walk by when the characteristicks have made a jest of all reveald religion especially the christian but if you despise the poor and illiterate i can in the same method judge of men in higher stations let the enemies to the social system behold the venerable counsellor now grown eminent for his wealth that at his great age continues sweltering at the bar to plead the doubtful cause and regardless of his dinner shortens his own life in endeavouring to secure the possessions of others how conspicuous is the benevolence of the physician to   his kind who from morning till night    visiting the sick keeps several sets of horses to be more serviceable to many and still grudges himself the time for the necessary functions of life in the same manner the indefatigable clergyman who with his ministry supplies a very large parish already sollicites with zeal to be as useful and beneficent to another tho fifty of his order yet unemployd offer their service for the same purpose hor i perceive your drift from the straind panegyricks you labour at you would form arguments ad absurdum the banter is ingenious enough and at proper times might serve to raise a laugh but then you must own likewise that those studyd encomiums will not bear to be seriously examind into when we consider that the great business as well as perpetual sollicitude of the poor are to supply their immediate wants and keep themselves from starving and that their children are a burden to them which they groan under and desire to be deliverd from by all possible means that are not clashing with the low involuntary affection which nature forces them to have for their offspring when i say we consider this the virtues of your industrious womana make no great figure the publick spirit likewise and the generous principles your sagacity has found out in the three faculties to which men are   brought up for a livelihood seem to be very far fetchd fame wealth and greatness every body knows are the things that all lawyers and physicians aim at that are any ways considerable that many of them entirely devote themselves to their practice with incredible patience and assiduity every age can witness but whatever labour or fatigue they submit to the motives of their actions are as conspicuous as their callings themselves cleo are they not beneficial to mankind and of use to the publick    hor i dont deny that we often receive inestimable benefits from them and the good ones in either profession are not only useful but very necessary to the society but tho there are several that sacrifice their whole lives and all the comforts of them to their business there is not one of them that would take a quarter of the pains he now is at if without taking any he could acquire the same money reputation and other advantages that may accrue to him from the esteem or gratitude of those whom he has been serviceable to and i dont believe there is an eminent man among them that would not own this if the question was put to him therefore when ambition and the love of money are the avowd principles men act from it is very silly to ascribe virtues to them which they themselves pretend to lay no manner of   claim to but your encomium upon the parson is the merriest jest of all i have heard many excuses made and some of them very frivolous for the covetousness of priests but what you have pickd out in their praise is more extraordinary than any thing i ever met with and the most partial advocate and admirer of the clergy never yet discoverd before your self a great virtue in their hunting after pluralities when they were well provided for themselves and many others for want of employ were ready to starve cleo but if there be any reality in the social system it would be better for the publick if men in all professions were to act from those generous principles and youll allow that the society would be the gainers if the generality in the three faculties would mind others more and themselves less than they do now hor i dont know that and considering what slavery some lawyers as well as physicians undergo i much question whether it would be possible for them to exert themselves in the same manner tho they  0 would if the constant baits and refreshments of large fees did not help to support human nature by continually stimulating this darling passion cleo indeed horatio this is a stronger argument against the social system and   more injurious to it than any thing that has been said by the author whom you have exclaimd against with so much bitterness hor i deny that i dont conclude from the selfishness in some that there is no virtue in others cleo nor he neither and you very much wrong him if you assert that he ever did hor i refuse to commend what is not praiseworthy but as bad as mankind are virtue has an existence as well as vice tho it is more scarce cleo what you said last no body ever contradicted but i dont know what you would be at does not the lord shaftsbury endeavour to do good and promote the social virtues and am i not doing the very same suppose me to be in the wrong in the favourable constructions i have made of things still it is to be wishd for at least that men had a greater regard to the publick welfare less fondness for their private interest and more charity for their neighbours than the generality of them have hor to be wishd for perhaps it may be but what probability is there that this ever will come to pass cleo and unless that can come to pass it is the idlest thing in the world to discourse upon and demonstrate the excellency of virtue what signifies it to set forth the   beauty of it unless it was possible that men should fall in love with it hor if virtue was never recommended men might grow worse than they are cleo then by the same reason if it was recommended more men might grow better than they are but i see perfectly well the reason of these shifts and evasions you make use of against your opinion you find your self under a necessity of allowing my panegyricks    as you call them to be just or finding the same fault with most of my lord shaftsburys and you would do neither if you could help it from mens preferring company to solitude his lordship pretends to prove the love and natural affection we have for our own species if this was examind into with the same strictness as you have done every thing i have said in behalf of the three faculties i believe that the solidity of the consequences would be pretty equal in both but i stick to my text and stand up for the social virtues the noble author of that system had a most charitable opinion of his species and extolld the dignity of it in an extraordinary manner and why my imitation of him should be calld a banter i see no reason he certainly wrote with a good design and endeavourd to inspire his readers with refind notions and a publick spirit abstract from religion the world enjoys the  0fruits of his labours but the advantage that is justly expected from his writings can never be universally felt before that publick spirit which he recommended comes down to the meanest tradesmen whom you would endeavour to exclude from the generous sentiments and noble principles that are already so visible in many i am now thinking on two sorts of people that stand very much in need of and yet hardly ever meet with one another this misfortune must have caused such a chasm in the band of society that no depth of thought or happiness of contrivance could have filld up the vacuity if a most tender regard for the commonwealth and the height of benevolence did not influence and oblige others mere strangers to those people and commonly men of small education to assist them with their good offices and stop up the gap many ingenious workmen in obscure dwellings would be starvd in spight of industry only for want of knowing where to sell the product of their labour if there were not others to dispose of it for them    and again the rich and extravagant are daily furnishd with an infinite variety of superfluous knicknacks and elaborate trifles every one of them invented to gratify either a needless curiosity or else wantonness and folly and which they would never have thought of much less wanted had they never seen   or known where to buy them what a blessing then to the publick is the social toyman who lays out a considerable estate to gratify the desires of these two different classes of people he procures food and raiment for the deserving poor and searches with great diligence after the most skillful artificers that no man shall be able to produce better workmanship than himself with studyd civilities and a serene countenance he entertains the greatest strangers and often speaking to them first kindly offers to guess at their wants he confines not his attendance to a few stated hours but waits their leisure all day long in an open shop where he bears the summers heat and winters cold with equal chearfulness what a beautiful prospect is here of natural affection to our kind for if he acts from that principle who only furnishes us with necessaries of life certainly he shews a more superlative love and indulgence to his species who will not suffer the most whimsical of it to be an hour destitute of what he shall fancy even things the most unnecessary hor you have made the most of it indeed but are you not tired yet with these fooleries your self cleo what fault do you find with these kind constructions do they detract from the dignity of our species    hor i admire your invention and thus much i will own that by overacting the part in that extravagant manner you have set the social system in a more disadvantageous light than ever i had considerd it before but the best things you know may be ridiculd    cleo whether i know that or not lord shaftsbury has flatly denied it and takes joke and banter to be the best and surest touchstone to prove the worth of things  it is his opinion that no ridicule can be fastend upon what is really great and good his lordship has made use of that test to try the scriptures and the christian religion by and exposd them because it seems they could not stand it hor he has exposed superstition and the miserable notions the vulgar were taught to have of god but no man ever had more sublime ideas of the supreme being and the universe than himself cleo you are convincd that what i charge him with is true hor i dont pretend to defend every syllable that noble lord has wrote his style is engaging his language polite his reasoning strong many of his thoughts are beautifully express d and his images for the greatest part inimitably fine i may be pleased with an author without obliging my self to answer every cavil that shall be made against   him as to what you call your imitation of him i have no taste in burlesque but the laugh you would raise might be turnd upon you with less trouble than you seem to have taken pray when you consider the hard and dirty labours that are performd to supply the mob with the vast quantities of strong beer they swill dont you discover social virtue in a drayman cleo yes and in a drayhorse too at least as well as i can in some great men who yet would be very angry should we refuse to believe that the most selfish actions of theirs if the society receivd but the least benefit from them were chiefly owing to principles of virtue and a generous regard to the publick    do you believe that in the choice of a pope the greatest dependance of the cardinals and what they principally rely upon is the influence of the holy ghost hor no more than i do transubstantiation cleo but if you had been brought up a roman catholick you would believe both hor i dont know that cleo you would if you was sincere in your religion as thousands of them are that are no more destitute of reason and good sense than you or i hor i have nothing to say as to that there are many things incomprehensible that yet are certainly true these are pro  perly the objects of faith and therefore when matters are above my capacity and really surpass my understanding i am silent and submit with great humility but i will swallow nothing which i plainly apprehend to be contrary to my reason and is directly clashing with my senses cleo if you believe a providence what demonstration can you have that god does not direct men in an affair of higher importance to all christendom than any other you can name hor this is an ensnaring and a very unfair question providence superintends and governs every thing without exception to defend my negative and give a reason for my unbelief it is sufficient if i prove that all the instruments and the means they make use of in those elections are visibly human and mundane and many of them unwarrantable and wicked cleo not all the means because every day they have prayers and solemnly invoke the divine assistance hor but what stress they lay upon it may be easily gatherd from the rest of their behaviour the court of rome is without dispute the greatest academy of refind politicks and the best school to learn the art of caballing there ordinary cunning and known stratagems are counted rusticity and designs are    pursued through all the mazes of   human subtlety genius there must give way to finesse as strength does to art in wrestling and a certain skill some men have in concealing their capacities from others is of far greater use with them than real knowledge or the soundest understanding in the sacred college where every thing is auro venale truth and justice bear the lowest price cardinal palavicini  and other jesuits that have been the stanch advocates of the papal authority have ownd with ostentation the politia religiosa della chiésa  and not hid from us the virtues and accomplishments that were only valuable among the purpurati  in whose judgment overreaching at any rate is the highest honour and to be outwitted tho by the basest artifice the greatest shame in conclaves more especially nothing is carried on without tricks and intrigue and in them the heart of man is so deep and so dark an abyss that the finest air of dissimulation is sometimes found to have been insincere and men often deceive one another by counterfeiting hypocrisy and is it credible that holiness religion or the least concern for spirituals should have any share in the plots machinations brigues   and contrivances of a society of which each member besides the gratification of his own passions has nothing at heart but the interest of his party right or wrong and to distress every faction that opposes it       cleo these sentiments confirm to me what i have often heard that renegades are the most cruel enemies hor was ever i a roman catholick cleo i mean from the social system of which you have been the most strenuous asserter and now no man can judge of actions more severely and indeed less charitably than yourself especially of the poor cardinals i little thought if once i quitted the scheme of deformity to have found an adversary in you but we have both changed sides it seems hor much alike i believe cleo nay what could any body think to hear me making the kindest interpretations of things that can be imagind and yourself doing quite the reverse hor what ignorant people that knew neither of us might have done i dont know but it has been very manifest from our discourse that you have maintaind your cause by endeavouring to shew the absurdity of the contrary side and that i have defended mine by letting you see that we were not such fools as you would represent us to be i had taken a resolution never to engage with you on this topick but you see i have broke it i hate to be thought uncivil it was mere complaisance drew me in tho i am not sorry that we talkd of it so much as we did because i found your opinion less dangerous than   i imagind you have ownd the existence of virtue and that there are men who act from it as a principle both which i thought you denied but i would not have you flatter yourself that you deceivd me by hanging out false colours cleo i did not lay on the disguise so thick as not to have you see through it nor would i ever have discoursd upon this subject with any body who could have been so easily imposed upon i know you to be a man of very good sense and sound judgment and it is for that very reason i so heartily wish you    would suffer me to explain my self and demonstrate to you how small the difference is between us which you imagine to be so considerable there is not a man in the world in whose opinion i would less pass for an ill man than in yours but i am so scrupulously fearful of offending you that i never dared to touch upon some points unless you had given me leave yield something to our friendship and condescend for once to read the fable of the bees for my sake its a handsome volume you love books i have one extremely well bound do let me suffer me to make you a present of it hor i am no bigot cleomenes but i am a man of honour and you know of strict honour i cannot endure to hear that ridiculd and the least attempt of it chafes my blood honour is the strongest and noblest   tye of society by far and therefore believe me can never be innocently sported with it is a thing so solid and awful as well as serious that it can at no time become the object of mirth or diversion and it is impossible for any pleasantry to be so ingenious or any jest so witty that i could bear with it on that head perhaps i am singular in this and if you will in the wrong be that as it will all i can say is je nentens pas raillerie la dessus  and therefore no fable of the bees for me if we are to remain friends i have heard enough of that cleo pray horatio can there be honour without justice hor no who affirms there can cleo have you not ownd that you have thought worse of me than now you find me to deserve no men nor their works ought to be condemnd upon hearsays and bare surmises much less upon the accusations of their enemies without being examind into hor there you are in the right i heartily beg    your pardon and to attone for the wrong i have done you say what you please ill hear it with patience be it never so shocking but i beg of you be serious cleo i have nothing to say to you that is distastful much less shocking all i desire is to convince you that i am neither so illnatured nor uncharitable in my opinion of mankind as you take me to be and that the   notions i entertain of the worth of things will not differ much from yours when both come to be lookd into do but consider what we have been doing i have endeavourd to set every thing in the handsomest light i could think of you say to ridicule the social system i own it now reflect on your own conduct which has been to shew the folly of my straind panegyricks and replace things in that natural view which all just knowing men would certainly behold them in this is very well done but it is contrary to the scheme you pretended to maintain and if you judge of all actions in the same manner theres an end of the social system or at least it will be evident that it is a theory never to be put into practice you argue for the generality of men that they are possessd of these virtues but when we come to particulars you can find none i have tried you every where you are as little satisfied with persons of the highest rank as you are with them of the lowest and you count it ridiculous to think better of the midling people is this otherwise than standing up for the goodness of a design at the same time you confess that it never was or ever can be executed what sort of people are they and where must we look for them whom you will own to act from those principles of virtue  0 hor are there not in all countries men of birth and ample fortune that would not accept of places tho they were offerd that are generous and beneficent and mind nothing but what is great and noble cleo yes but examine their conduct look into    their lives and scan their actions with as little indulgence as you did those of the cardinals or the lawyers and physicians and then see what figure their virtues will make beyond those of the poor industrious woman there is generally speaking less truth in panegyricks than there is in satyrs when all our senses are soothed when we have no distemper of body or mind to disturb us and meet with nothing that is disagreeable we are pleased with our being it is in this situation that we are most apt to mistake outward appearances for realities and judge of things more favourably than they deserve remember horatio how feelingly you spoke half an hour ago in commendation of operas your soul seemd to be lifted up whilst you was thinking on the many charms you find in them i have nothing to say against the elegancy of the diversion or the politeness of those that frequent them but i am afraid you lost yourself in the contemplation of the lovely idea when you asserted that they were the most proper means to contract a strong and lasting habit of virtue   do you think that among the same num  ber of people there is more real virtue at an opera than there is at a beargarden hor what a comparison cleo i am very serious hor the noise of dogs and bulls and bears make a fine harmony cleo it is impossible you should mistake me and you know very well that it is not the different pleasures of those two places i would compare together the things you mentiond are the least to be complaind of the continual sounds of oaths and imprecations the frequent repetitions of the word lie and other more filthy expressions the lowdness and dissonance of many straind and untuneful voices are a perfect torment to a delicate ear the frowsiness of the  0 place and the ill scents of different kinds are a perpetual nuisance but in all mob meetings hor lodorat souffre beaucoup cleo the entertainment in general is abominable and all the senses suffer i allow all this the greasy heads some of them bloody the jarring looks and threatning wild and horrid aspects that one meets with in those everrestless assemblies must be very shocking to the sight and so indeed is every thing else that can be seen among a rude and ragged multitude that are coverd with dirt and have in none of their pastimes one action that is inoffensive but after all vice and what is   criminal are not to be confounded with roughness and want of manners no more than politeness and an artful behaviour ought to be with virtue or religion to tell a premeditated falshood in order to do mischief is a greater sin than to give a man the lie who speaks an untruth and it is possible that a person may suffer greater damage and more injury to his ruin from slander in the low whisper of a secret enemy than he could have receivd from all the dreadful swearing and cursing the most noisy antagonist could pelt him with incontinence and adultery it self persons of quality are not more free from all over christendom than the meaner people but if there are some vices which the vulgar are more guilty of than the better sort there are others the reverse envy detraction and the spirit of revenge are more raging and mischievous in courts than they are in cottages excess of vanity and hurtful ambition are unknown among the poor they are seldom tainted with avarice with irreligion never and they have much less opportunity of robbing the publick than their betters there are few persons of distinction whom you are not acquainted with i desire you would seriously reflect on the lives of as many as you can think of and next opera night on the virtues of the assembly       hor you make me laugh there is a good deal in what you say and i am persuaded all is not gold that glisters would you add any more cleo since you have given me leave to talk and you are such a patient hearer i would not slip the opportunity of laying before you some things of high concern that perhaps you never considerd in the light which you shall own yourself they ought to be seen in hor i am sorry to leave you but i have really business that must be done tonight it is about my lawsuit and i have stayd beyond my time already but if you will come and eat a bit of mutton with me tomorrow ill see no body but your self and well converse as long as you please cleo with all my heart ill not fail to wait on you    the second dialogue   the second dialogue between horatio and cleomenes h o r a t i o the discourse we had yesterday has made a great impression upon me you said several things that were very entertaining and some which i shall not easily forget i dont remember i ever lookd into myself so much as i have done since last night after i left you cleo to do that faithfully is a more difficult and a severer task than is commonly imagind when yesterday i askd you where and among what sort of people we were to look for those whom you would allow to act from principles of virtue you named a class among whom i have found very agreeable characters of men that yet all have their   failings if these could be left out and the best were pickd and culld from the different good qualities that are    to be seen in several the compound would make a very handsome picture hor to finish it well every way would be a great masterpiece cleo that i shant attempt but i dont think it would be very difficult to make a little sketch of it that yet should exceed nature and be a better pattern for imitation than any can be shewn alive i have a mind to try the very thought enlivens me how charming is the portrait of a complete gentleman and how ravishing is the figure which a person of great birth and fortune to whom nature has been no niggard makes when he understands the world and is throughly well bred hor i think them so i can assure you whether you are in jest or in earnest cleo how entirely well hid are his greatest imperfections tho money is his idol and he is covetous in his heart yet his inward avarice is forcd to give way to his outward liberality and an open generosity shines through all his actions hor there lies your fault it is this i cannot endure in you cleo whats the matter hor i know what you are about you are going to give me the caricatura of a gentle  man under pretence of drawing his portrait cleo you wrong me i have no such thought hor but why is it impossible for human nature ever to be good instead of leaving out you put in failings without the least grounds or colour when things have a handsome appearance every way what reason have you to suspect them still to be bad how came you to know and which way have you discoverd imperfections that are entirely well hid and why should you suppose a person to be covetous in his heart and that money is his idol when you own yourself that he never shews it and that an open    generosity shines through all his actions this is monstrous  cleo i have made no such supposition of any man and i protest to you that in what i said i had no other meaning than to observe that whatever frailties and natural infirmities persons might be conscious of within good sense and good manners were capable and without any other assistance sufficient to keep them out of sight but your questions are very seasonable and since you have started this i will be very open to you and acquaint you beforehand with my design of the description i am going to make and the use i intend it for which in short is to demonstrate to you that a most beautiful super  structure may be raisd upon a rotten and despicable foundation youll understand me better presently hor but how do you know a foundation to be rotten that supports the building and is wholly conceald from you cleo have patience and i promise you that i shall take nothing for granted which you shall not allow of yourself hor stick close to that and i desire no more now say what you will cleo the true object of pride or vainglory is the opinion of others and the most superlative wish which a man possessd and entirely filld with it can make is that he may be well thought of applauded and admired by the whole world not only in the present but all future ages this passion is generally exploded but it is incredible how many strange and widely different miracles are and may be performd by the force of it as persons differ in circumstances and inclinations in the first place there is no danger so great but by the help of his pride a man may    slight and confront it nor any manner of death so terrible but with the same assistance he may court and if he has a firm constitution undergo it with alacrity in the second there are no good offices or duties either to others or ourselves that cicero has spoke of nor any instances of benevolence humanity or other social virtue that   lord shaftsbury has hinted at but a man of good sense and knowledge may learn to practise them from no better principle than vainglory if it be strong enough to subdue and keep under all other passions that may thwart and interfere with his design hor shall i allow all this cleo yes hor when cleo before we part hor very well cleo men of tolerable parts in plentiful circumstances that were artfully educated and are not singular in their temper can hardly fail of a genteel behaviour the more pride they have and the greater value they set on the esteem of others the more theyll make it their study to render themselves acceptable to all they converse with and theyll take uncommon pains to conceal and stifle in their bosoms every thing which their good sense tells them ought not to be seen or understood hor i must interrupt you and cannot suffer you to go on thus what is all this but the old story over again that every thing is pride and all we see hypocrisy without proof or argument nothing in the world is more false than what you have advanced now for according to that the most noble the most gallant and the bestbred man would be the proudest which is so clashing   with daily experience that the very reverse is true pride and insolence are no where more common than among upstarts men of no family that raise estates out of nothing and the most ordinary people that having had no education    are puffd up with their fortune whenever they are lifted up above mediocrity and from mean stations advanced to posts of honour whereas no men upon earth generally speaking are more courteous humane or polite than persons of high birth that enjoy the large possessions and known seats of their ancestors men illustrious by descent that have been used to grandeur and titles of honour from their infancy and receivd an education suitable to their quality i dont believe there ever was a nation that were not savages in which the youth of both sexes were not expressly taught never to be proud or haughty did you ever know a school a tutor or a parent that did not continually inculcate to those under their care to be civil and obliging nay does not the word mannerly itself import as much cleo i beg of you let us be calm and speak with exactness the doctrine of good manners furnishes us with a thousand lessons against the various appearances and outward symptoms of pride but it has not one precept against the passion it self  hor how is that  0 cleo no not one against the passion it self the conquest of it is never attempted nor talkd of in a gentlemans education where men are to be continually inspired and kept warm with the sense of their honour and the inward value they must put upon themselves on all emergencies hor this is worth consideration and requires time to be examind into but where is your fine gentleman the picture you promisd cleo i am ready and shall begin with his dwelling tho he has several noble seats in different countiesa yet i shall only take notice of his chief mansionhouse that bears the name and does the honours of the family this is amply magnificent and yet commodious to admiration his gardens are very extensive and contain an infinite variety of pleasing objects    they are divided into many branches for divers purposes and every where filld with improvements of art upon nature yet a beautiful order and happy contrivance are conspicuous through every part and tho nothing is omitted to render them stately and delightful the whole is laid out to the best advantage within doors every thing bespeaks the grandeur and judgment of the master and as no cost is spared any where to procure beauty or conveniency so you see none impertinently lavishd all his plate   and furniture are completely fine and you see nothing but what is fashionable he has no pictures but of the most eminent hands the rarities he shews are really such he hoards up no trifles nor offers any thing to your sight that is shocking but the several collections he has of this sort are agreeable as well as extraordinary and rather valuable than large but curiosities and wealth are not confind to his cabinet the marble and sculpture that are displayd up and down are a treasure themselves and there is abundance of admirable gilding and excellent carving to be seen in many places what has been laid out on the great hall and one gallery would be a considerable estate and there is a salloon and a staircase not inferior to either these are all very spacious and lofty the architecture of them is of the best taste and the decorations surprising throughout the whole there appears a delicate mixture and astonishing variety of lively embellishments the splendor of which joind to a perfect cleanliness no where neglected are highly entertaining to the most careless and least observng eye whilst the exactness of the workmanship bestowd on every part of the meanest utensil gives a more solid satisfaction and is ravishing to the curious but the greatest excellency in this model of perfection is this that as in the most ordina  ry rooms there is nothing wanting for their purpose and the least passage is handsomly finishd so in those    of the greatest eclat there is nothing overchargd nor any part of them incumbred with ornaments hor this is a studyd piece but i dont like it the worse for it pray go on cleo i have thought of it before i own his equipage is rich and well chosen and there is nothing to be seen about him that art or expence within the compass of reason could make better at his own table his looks are ever jovial and his heart seems to be as open as his countenance his chief business there is to take care of others without being troublesome and all his happiness seems to consist in being able to please his friends in his greatest mirth he is wanting in respect to no man and never makes use of abbreviations in names or unhandsome familiarities with the meanest of his guests to every one that speaks to him he gives an obliging attention and seems never to disregard any thing but what is said in commendation of his fare he never interrupts any discourse but what is made in his praise and seldom assents to any encomiums tho the most equitable that are made on any thing that is his when he is abroad he never spies faults and whatever is amiss he either says nothing or in answer to the com  plaints and uneasiness of others gives every thing the bestnaturd turn it can bear but he seldom leaves a house before he finds out something to extoll in it without wronging his judgment his conversation is always facetious and goodhumourd but as solid as it is diverting he never utters a syllable that has the least tincture of obscenity or prophaneness nor ever made a jest that was offensive hor very fine cleo he seems to be entirely free from bigotry and superstition avoids all disputes about religion but goes constantly to church and is seldom absent from his familydevotions    hor a very godly gentleman cleo i expected we should differ there hor i dont find fault proceed pray cleo as he is a man of erudition himself so he is a promoter of arts and sciences he is a friend to merit a rewarder of industry and a professd enemy to nothing but immorality and oppression tho no mans table is better furnishd nor cellars better stored he is temperate in his eating and never commits excess in drinking tho he has an exquisite palate he always prefers wholesome meats to those that are delicious only and never indulges his appetite in any thing that might probably be prejudicial to his health    hor admirably good cleo as he is in all other things so he is elegant in his cloaths and has often new ones neatness he prefers to finery in his own dress but his retinue is rich he seldom wears gold or silver himself but on very solemn occasions in compliment to others and to demonstrate that these pompous habits are made for no other purpose he is never seen twice in the same but having appeard in them one day he gives them away the next tho of every thing he has the best of the sort and might be calld curious in apparel yet he leaves the care of it to others and no man has his cloaths put on better that seems so little to regard them hor perfectly right to be well dressd is a necessary article and yet to be sollicitous about it is below a person of quality cleo therefore he has a domestick of good taste a judicious man who saves him that trouble and the management likewise of his lace and linnen is the province of a skilful woman his language is courtly but natural and intelligible it is neither low nor bombastick and ever free from pedantick and vulgar expressions all his motions are genteel without  0 affectation his mein is rather sedate than airy and his manner noble for tho he is ever civil and condescending and no man less   arrogant yet in all his carriage there is something gracefully majestick and as there is nothing mean in his humility so his loftiness has nothing disobliging hor prodigiously good cleo he is charitable to the poor his house is never shut to strangers and all his neighbours he counts to be his friends he is a father to his tenants and looks upon their welfare as inseparable from his interest no man is less uneasy at little offences or more ready to forgive all trespasses without design the injuries that are sufferd from other landlords he turns into benefits and whatever damages great or small are sustaind on his account either from his diversions or otherwise he doubly makes good he takes care to be early informd of such losses and commonly repairs them before they are complaind of hor oh rare humanity hearken ye foxhunters cleo he never chides any of his people yet no man is better servd and tho nothing is wanting in his housekeeping and his family is very numerous yet the regularity of it is no less remarkable than the plenty they live in his orders he will have strictly obeyd but his commands are always reasonable and he never speaks to the meanest footman without regard to humanity extraordinary diligence in servants and all laud  able actions he takes notice of himself and often commends them to their faces but leaves it to his steward to reprove or dismiss those he dislikes hor well judgd cleo whoever lives with him is taken care of in sickness as well as in health the wages he gives are above double those of other masters and he often makes presents to those that are more than ordinary observing and industrious to please but he suffers    no body to take a penny of his friends or others that come to his house on any account whatever many faults are connivd at or pardond for the first time but a breach of this order is ever attended with the loss of their places as soon as it is found out and there is a premium for the discovery hor this is the only exceptionable thing in my opinion that i have heard yet cleo i wonder at that why so pray hor in the first place it is very difficult to enforce obedience to such a command secondly if it could be executed it would be of little use unless it could be made general which is impossible and therefore i look upon the attempt of introducing this maxim to be singular and fantastical it would please misers and others that would never follow the example at home but it would take away from generous men a handsome opportunity of shewing their liberal and beneficent   disposition besides it would manifestly make ones house too open to all sorts of people cleo ways might be found to prevent that but then it would be a blessing and do great kindness to men of parts and education that have little to spare to many of whom this money to servants is a very grievous burden hor what you mention is the only thing that can be said for it and i own of great weight but i beg your pardon for interrupting you cleo in all his dealings he is punctual and just as he has an immense estate so he has good managers to take care of it but tho all his accounts are very neatly kept yet he makes it part of his business to look them over himself he suffers no tradesmans bill to lie by unexamind and tho he meddles not with his ready cash himself yet he is a quick and chearful as well as an exact paymaster and the only singularity he is guilty of is that he never will owe any thing on a newyears day    hor i like that very well cleo he is affable with discretion of easy access and never ruffled with passion to sum up all no man seems to be less elevated with his condition than himself and in the full enjoyment of so many personal accomplishments as well as other possessions his modesty is equal to the rest of his happi  ness and in the midst of the pomp and distinction he lives in he never appears to be entertaind with his greatness but rather unacquainted with the things he excels in hor it is an admirable character and pleases me exceedingly but i will freely own to you that i should have been more highly delighted with the description if i had not known your design and the use you intend to make of it which i think is barbarous to raise so fine so elegant and so complete an edifice in order to throw it down is taking great pains to shew ones skill in doing mischief i have observd the several places where you left room for evasions and sapping the foundation you have built upon his heart seems to be as open and he never appears to be entertaind with his greatness  i am persuaded that whereever you have put in this seeming and appearing you have done it designedly and with an intent to make use of them as so many backdoors to creep out at i could never have taken notice of these things if you had not acquainted me with your intention beforehand cleo i have made use of the caution you speak of but with no other view than to avoid just censure and prevent your accusing me of incorrectness or judging with too much precipitation if it should be proved afterwards that this gentleman had acted from an ill principle which is the thing i own i   purposd to convince you of but seeing that it would be unpleasant to you ill be satisfied with having given you some small entertainment in the description    and for the rest i give you leave to think me in the wrong hor why so i thought the character was made and contrivd on purpose for my instruction cleo i dont pretend to instruct you i would have offerd something and appeald to your judgmenta but i have been mistaken and plainly see my error both last night and now when we began our discourse i took you to be in another disposition of thinking than i perceive you are you spoke of an impression that had been made upon you and of looking into your self and gave some other hints which too rashly i misconstrued in my favour but i have found since that you are as warm as ever against the sentiments i profess myself to be of and therefore ill desist i expect no pleasure from any triumph and i know nothing that would vex me more than the thoughts of disobliging you pray let us do in this as we do in another matter of importance never touch upon it friends in prudence should avoid all subjects in which they are known essentially to differ believe me horatio if it was in my power to divert or give you any pleasure i would grudge no pains to compass that end but to make you uneasy is a thing that i shall never be know 0ingly guilty of and i beg a thousand pardons for having said so much both yesterday and today have you heard any thing from gibraltar  hor i am ashamed of my weakness and your civility you have not been mistaken in the hints you speak of what you have said has certainly made a great impression upon me and i have endeavourd to examine myself but as you say it is a severe task to do it faithfully i desired you to dine with me on purpose that we might talk of these things    it is i that have offended and it is i that ought to ask pardon for the ill manners i have been guilty of but you know the principles i have always adhered to it is impossible to recede from them at once i see great difficulties and now and then a glimpse of truth that makes me start i sometimes feel great struggles within but i have been so used to derive all actions that are really good from laudable motives that as soon as i return to my accustomd way of thinking it carries all before it pray bear with my infirmities i am in love with your fine gentleman and i confess i cannot see how a person so universally good so far remote from all selfishness can act in such an extraordinary manner every way but from principles of virtue and religion where is there such a landlord in the world if i am in an error i shall be glad to be undeceivd pray   inform me and say what you will i promise you to keep my temper and i beg of you speak your mind with freedom cleo you have bid me before say what i would and when i did you seemd displeasd but since you command me i will try once more—— —— ——whether there is or ever was such a man as i have describd in the world is not very material but i will easily allow that most people would think it less difficult to conceive one than to imagine that such a clear and beautiful stream could flow from so mean and muddy a spring as an excessive thirst after praise and an immoderate desire of general applause from the most knowing judges yet it is certain that great parts and extraordinary riches may compass all this in a man who is not deformd and has had a refind education and that there are many persons naturally no better than thousand others who by the helps mentiond might attain to those good qualities and accomplishments if they had but resolution and perseverance enough to render every appetite and    every faculty subservient to that one predominant passion which if continually gratifyd will always enable them to govern and if requird to subdue all the rest without exception even in the most difficult cases hor to enter into an argument concerning the possibility of what you say might occasion a long dispute but the probability i   think is very clear against you and if there was such a man it would be much more credible that he acted from the excellency of his nature in which so many virtues and rare endowments were assembled than that all his good qualities sprung from vicious motives if pride could be the cause of all this the effect of it would sometimes appear in others according to your system there is no scarcity of it and there are men of great parts and prodigious estates all over europe why are there not several such patterns to be seen up and down as you have drawn us one and why is it so very seldom that many virtues and good qualities are seen to meet in one individual cleo why so few persons tho there are so many men of immense fortune ever arrive at any thing like this high pitch of accomplishments there are several reasons that are very obvious in the first place men differ in temperament some are naturally of an active stirring others of an indolent quiet disposition some of a bold others of a meek spirit in the second it is to be considerd that this temperament in men come to maturity is more or less conspicuous according as it has been either checkd or encouragd by education thirdly that on these two depend the different perception men have of happiness according to which the love of glory determines them different ways some think   it the greatest felicity to govern and rule over others some take the praise of bravery and undauntedness in dangers to be the most valuable    others erudition and to be a celebrated author so that tho they all love glory they set out differently to acquire it but a man who hates a bustle and is naturally of a quiet easy temper and which has been encouraged in him by education it is very likely might think nothing more desirable than the character of a fine gentleman and if he did i dare say that he would endeavour to behave himself pretty near the pattern i have given you i say pretty near because i may have been mistaken in some things and as i have not touchd upon every thing some will say that i have left out several necessary ones but in the main i believe that in the country and age we live in the qualifications i have named would get a man the reputation i have supposed him to desire hor without doubt i make no manner of scruple about what you said last and i told you before that it was an admirable character and pleasd me exceedingly that i took notice of your making your gentleman so very godly as you did was because it is not common but i intended it not as a reflection one thing indeed there was in which i differd from you but that was merely speculative and since i have reflected on what   you answered me i dont know but i may be in the wrong as i should certainly believe myself to be if there really was such a man and he was of the contrary opinion to such a fine genius i would pay an uncommon deference and with great readiness submit my understanding to his superiour capacity but the reasons you give why those effects which you ascribe to pride are not more common the cause being so universal i think are insufficient that men are prompted to follow different ends as their inclinations differ i can easily allow but there are great numbers of rich men that are likewise of a quiet and indolent disposition and moreover very desirous of being thought fine gentlemen how comes it that among so many persons of    high birth princely estates and the most refind education as there are in christendom that study travel and take great pains to be wellaccomplishd there is not one to whom all the good qualities and every thing you named could be applied without flattery cleo it is very possible that thousands may aim at this and not one of them succeed to that degree in some perhaps the predominant passion is not strong enough entirely to subdue the rest love or covetousness may divert others drinking gaming may draw away many and break in upon their resolution they may not have strength to persevere in a design and steadily to pursue the same   ends or they may want a true taste and knowledge of what is esteemd by men of judgment or lastly they may not be so thoroughly wellbred as is required to conceal themselves on all emergencies for the practical part of dissimulation is infinitely more difficult than the theory and any one of these obstacles is sufficient to spoil all and hinder the finishing of such a piece hor i shall not dispute that with you but all this while you have proved nothing nor given the least reason why you should imagine that a man of a character to all outward appearance so bright and beautiful acted from vicious motives you would not condemn him without so much as naming the cause why you suspect him cleo by no means nor have i advanced any thing that is illnatured or uncharitable for i have not said that if i found a gentleman in possession of all the things i mentiond i would give his rare endowments this turn and think all his perfections derived from no better stock than an extraordinary love of glory what i argue for and insist upon is the possibility that all these things might be performd by a man from no other views and with no other helps than those i have named nay i believe moreover    that a gentleman so accomplished all his knowledge and great parts notwithstanding may himself be ignorant or at least   not well assured of the motive he acts from hor this is more unintelligible than any thing you have said yet why will you heap difficulties upon one another without solving any i desire you would clear up this last paradox before you do any thing else cleo in order to obey you i must put you in mind of what happens in early education by the first rudiments of which infants are taught in the choice of actions to prefer the precepts of others to the dicates of their own inclinations which in short is no more than doing as they are bid to gain this point punishments and rewards are not neglected and many different methods are made use of but it is certain that nothing proves more often effectual for this purpose or has a greater influence upon children than the handle that is made of shame which tho a natural passion they would not be sensible of so soon if we did not artfully rouze and stir it up in them before they can speak or go by which means their judgments being then weak we may teach them to be ashamd of what we please as soon as we can perceive them to be any ways affected with the passion itself but as the fear of shame is very insignificant where there is but little pride so it is impossible to augment the first without encreasing the latter in the same proportion    hor i should have thought that this encrease of pride would render children more stubborn and less docile cleo you judge right it would so and must have been a great hindrance to good manners till experience taught men that tho pride was not to be destroyd by force it might be governd by stratagem and that the best way to manage it is by playing the    passion against itself hence it is that in an artful education we are allowd to place as much pride as we please in our dexterity of concealing it  i do not suppose that this covering ourselves notwithstanding the pride we take in it is performd without a difficulty that is plainly felt and perhaps very unpleasant at first but this wears off as we grow up and when a man has behaved himself with so much prudence as i have describd lived up to the strictest rules of good breeding for many years and has gaind the esteem of all that know him when his a noble and polite manner is become habitual to him it is possible he may in time forget the principle he set out with and become ignorant or at least insensible of the hidden spring that gives life and motion to all his actions hor i am convincd of the great use that may be made of pride if you will call it so but i am not satisfied yet how a man of so much sense knowledge and penetration one that understands himself so entirely well   should be ignorant of his own heart and the motives he acts from what is it that induces you to believe this besides the possibility of his forgetfulness cleo i have two reasons for it which i desire may be seriously considerd the first is that in what relates to ourselves especially our own worth and excellencyb pride blinds the understanding in men of sense and great parts as well as in others and the greater value we may reasonably set upon ourselves the fitter we are to swallow the grossest flatteries in spight of all our knowledge and abilities in other matters witness alexander the great whose vast genius could not hinder him from doubting seriously whether he was a god or not  my second reason will prove to us that if the person in question was capable of examining himself it is yet highly improbable  0 that he would ever set about it for it must be granted that in order to search into ourselves it is required we should be willing as well as able and we have all the reason in the world to think that there is nothing which a very proud man of such high qualifications would avoid more carefully than such an enquiry because for all other acts of selfdenial he is repaid in his darling passion but this alone is really mortifying and the only sacrifice of his quiet for which he can have no equivalent if the hearts of the best and sincerest men are corrupt and deceit  ful what condition must theirs be in whose whole life is one continued scene of hypocrisy therefore enquiring within and boldly searching into ones own bosom must be the most shocking employment that a man can give his mind to whose greatest pleasure consists in secretly admiring himself it would be ill manners after this to appeal to your self but the severity of the task … hor say no more i yield this point tho i own i cannot conceive what advantage you can expect from it for instead of removing it will rather help to encrease the grand difficulty which is to prove that this complete person you have describd acts from a vicious motive and if that be not your design i cannot see what you drive at cleo i told you it was hor you must have a prodigious sagacity in detecting abstruse matters beyond other men cleo you wonder i know which way i arrogate to my self such a superlative degree of penetration as to know an artful cunning man better than he does himself and how i dare pretend to enter and look into a heart which i have ownd to be completely well conceald from all the world which in strictness is an impossibility and consequently not to be braggd of but by a coxcomb hor you may treat yourself as you please i have  0    said no such thing but i own that i long to see it proved that you have this capacity i remember the character very well notwithstanding the precautions you have taken it is very full i told you before that where things have a handsome appearance every way there can be no just cause to suspect them ill stick close to that your gentleman is all of a piece you shall alter nothing either by retracting any of the good qualities you have given him or making additions that are either clashing with or unsuitable to what you have allowd already cleo i shall attempt neither and without that decisive tryals may be made by which it will plainly appear whether a person acts from inward goodness and a principle of religion or only from a motive of vainglory and in the latter case there is an infallible way of dragging the lurking fiend from his darkest recesses into a glaring light where all the world shall know him hor i dont think my self a match for you in argument but i have a great mind to be your gentlemans advocate against all your infallibility i never liked a cause better in my life come i undertake to defend him in all the suppositions you can make that are reasonable and consistent with what you have said before cleo very well let us suppose what may happen to the most inoffensive the most prudent and bestbred man that our fine gen  tleman differs in opinion before company with another who is his equal in birth and quality but not so much master over his outward behaviour and less guarded in his conduct let this adversary mal a propos grow warm and seem to be wanting in the respect that is due to the other and reflect on his honour in ambiguous terms what is your client to do hor immediately to ask for an explanation cleo which if the hot man disregards with scorn or flatly refuses to give satisfaction must be demanded and tilt they must    hor you are too hasty it happend before company in such cases friends or any gentlemen present should interpose and take care that if threatning words ensue they are by the civil authority both put under arrest and before they came to uncourteous language they ought to have been parted by friendly force if it were possible after that overtures may be made of reconciliation with the nicest regard to the point of honour cleo i dont ask for directions to prevent a quarrel what you say may be done or it may not be done the good offices of friends may succeed and they may not succeed i am to make what suppositions i think fit within the verge of possibility so they are reasonable and consistent with the character i   have drawn can we not suppose these two persons in such a situation that you yourself would advise your friend to send his adversary a challenge hor without doubt such a thing may happen cleo thats enough after that a duel must ensue in which without determining any thing the fine gentleman well say behaves himself with the utmost gallantry hor to have expected or supposd otherwise would have been unreasonable cleo you see therefore how fair i am but what is it pray that so suddenly disposes a courteous sweettemperd man for so small an evil to seek a remedy of that extreme violence but above all what is it that buoys up and supports him against the fear of death for there lies the greatest difficulty hor his natural courage and intrepidity built on the innocence of his life and the rectitude of his manners cleo but what makes so just and prudent a man that has the good of society so much at heart act knowingly against the laws of his country hor the strict obedience he pays to the laws of honour which are superior to all others    cleo if men of honour would act consistently they ought all to be roman catholicks    hor why pray cleo because they prefer oral tradition to all written laws for no body can tell when in what kings or emperors reign in what country or by what authority these laws of honour were first enacted it is very strange they should be of such force hor they are a wrote and engraved in every ones breast that is a man of honour there is no denying of it you are conscious of it your self every body feels it within cleo let them be wrote or engraved whereever you please they are directly opposite to and clashing with the laws of god and if the gentleman i described b was as sincere in his religion as he appeard to be he must have been of an opinion contrary to yours for christians of all persuasions are unanimous in allowing the divine laws to be far above all other and that all other considerations ought to give way to them how and under what pretence can a christian who is a man of sense submit or agree to laws that prescribe revenge and countenance murder both which are so expressly forbid by the precepts of his religion hor i am no casuist but you know that what i say is true and that among persons of honour a man would be laughd at that should make such a scruple not but that i think killing a man to be a great sin   where it can be helpd and that all prudent men ought to avoid the occasion as much as it is in their power he is highly blameable who is the first aggressor and gives the affront and whoever enters upon it out of levity or seeks a quarrel out of wantonness ought to be hangd no body would chuse it who is not a fool and yet when it is c forcd upon one all the wisdom in the world cannot teach him how to avoid it it has been my case you    know i shall never forget the reluctancy i had against it but necessity has no law cleo i saw you that very morning and you seem d to be sedate and void of passion you could have no concern hor it is silly to shew any at such times but i know best what i felt the struggle i had within was unspeakable it is a terrible thing i would then have given a considerable part of my estate that the thing which forcd me into it had not happend and yet upon less provocation i would act the same part again tomorrow cleo do you remember what your concern was chiefly about hor how can you ask it is an affair of the highest importance that can occur in life i was no boy it was after we came from italy i was in my nine and twentieth year had very good acquaintance and was not ill receivd a man of that age in   health and vigour who has seven thousand a year and the prospect of being a peer of england has no reason to quarrel with the world or wish himself out of it it is a very great hazard a man runs in a duel besides the remorse and uneasiness one must feel as long as he lives if he has the misfortune of killing his adversary it is impossible to reflect on all these things and at the same time resolve to run those hazards tho there are other considerations of still greater moment without being under a prodigious concern cleo you say nothing about the sin hor the thoughts of that without doubt are a great addition but the other things are so weighty of themselves that a mans condition at such a time is very perplexd without further reflection cleo you have now a very fine opportunity horatio of looking into your heart and with a little of my assistance examining yourself if you can    condescend to this i promise you that you shall make great discoveries and be convincd of truths you are now unwilling to believe a lover of justice and probity as you are ought not to be fond of a road of thinking where he is always forcd to skulk and never dares to meet with light or reason will you suffer me to ask you some questions and will   you answer them directly and in good humour hor i will without reserve cleo do you remember the storm upon the coast of genoa hor going to naples very well it makes me cold to think of it cleo was you afraid hor never more in my life i hate that fickle element i cant endure the sea cleo what was you afraid of hor thats a pretty question do you think a young fellow of six and twenty as i was then and in my circumstances had a great mind to be drownd the captain himself said we were in danger cleo but neither he nor any body else discoverd half so much fear and anxiety as you did hor there was no body there yourself excepted that had half a quarter so much to lose as i had besides they are used to the sea storms are familiar to them  i had never been at sea before but that fine afternoon we crossd from dover to calais    cleo want of knowledge and experience may make men apprehend danger where there is none but real dangers when they are known to be such try the natural courage of all men whether they have been used to them or not sailors are as unwilling to lose their lives as other people    hor i am not ashamed to own that i am a great coward at sea give me terra firma and then—– cleo six or seven months after you fought that duel i remember you had the smallpox you was then very much afraid of dying hor not without a cause cleo i heard your physicians say that the violent apprehension you was under hinderd your sleep increased your fever and was as mischievous to you as the distemper itself hor that was a terrible time im glad it is over i had a sister died of it before i had it i was in perpetual dread of it and many times to hear it named only has made me uneasy cleo natural courage is a general armour against the fear of death whatever shape that appears in sin fractus illabatur orbis  it supports a man in tempestuous seas and in a burning fever whilst he is in his senses as well as in a siege before a town or in a duel with seconds hor what you are going to shew me that i have no courage cleo far from it it would be ridiculous to doubt a mans bravery that has shewn it in such an extraordinary manner as you have done more than once what i question is the epithet you joind to it at first the word   natural for there is a great difference between that and artificial courage hor thats a chicane i wont enter into but i am not of your opinion as to what you said before a gentleman is not required to shew his bravery but    where his honour is concernd and if he dares to fight for his king his friend his mistress and every thing where his reputation is engaged you shall think of him what you please for the rest besides that in sickness and other dangers as well as afflictions where the hand of god is plainly to be seen courage and intrepidity are impious as well as impertinent undauntedness in chastisements is a kind of rebellion it is waging war with heaven which none but atheists and freethinkers would be guilty of it is only they that can glory in impenitence and talk of dying hard all others that have any sense of religion desire to repent before they go out of the world the best of us dont always live as we could wish to die cleo i am very glad to hear you are so religious but dont you perceive yet how inconsistent you are with yourself how can a man sincerely wish to repent that willfully plunges himself into a mortal sin and an action where he runs a greater and more immediate hazard of his life than he could have done in almost any other without force or necessity    hor i have over and over ownd to you that duelling is a sin and unless a man is forced to it by necessity i believe a mortal one but this was not my case and therefore i hope god will forgive me let them look to it that make a sport of it but when a man comes to an action with the utmost reluctancy and what he does is not possibly to be avoided i think he then may justly be said to be forcd to it and to act from necessity you may blame the rigorous laws of honour and the tyranny of custom but a man that will live in the world must and is bound to obey them would not you do it yourself cleo dont ask me what i would do the question is what every body ought to do can a man    believe the bible and at the same time apprehend a tyrant more crafty or malicious more unrelenting or inhuman than the devil or a mischief worse than hell and pains either more exquisite or more durable than torments unspeakable and yet everlasting you dont answer what evil is it think of it and tell me what dismal thing it is you apprehend should you neglect those laws and despise that tyrant what calamity could befall you let me know the worst that can be feard hor would you be posted for a coward cleo for what for not daring to violate all human and divine laws  0 hor strictly speaking you are in the right it is unanswerable but who will consider things in that light cleo all good christians hor where are they then for all mankind in general would despise and laugh at a man who should move those scruples i have heard and seen clergymen themselves in company shew their contempt of poltrons whatever they might talk or recommend in the pulpit entirely to quit the world and at once to renounce the conversation of all persons that are valuable in it is a terrible thing to resolve upon would you become a town and tabletalk could you submit to be the jest and scorn of publickhouses stage coaches and marketplaces is not this the certain fate of a man who should refuse to fight or bear an affront without resentment be just cleomenes is it to be avoided must he not be made a common laughingstock be pointed at in the streets and serve for diversion to the very children to linkboys and hackney coachmen is it a thought to be born with patience cleo how come you now to have such an anxious regard for what may be the opinion of the vulgar whom at other times you so heartily despise    hor all this is reasoning and you know the thing will not bear it how can you be so cruel    cleo how can you be so backward in discovering and owning the passion that is so conspicuously the occasion of all this the palpable and only cause of the uneasiness we feel at the thoughts of being despisd hor i am not sensible of any and i declare to you that i feel nothing that moves me to speak as i do but the sense and principle of honour within me cleo do you think that the lowest of the mob and the scum of the people are possessd of any part of this principle hor no indeed cleo or that among the highest quality infants can be affected with it before they are two years old hor ridiculous cleo if neither of these are affected with it then honour should be either adventitious and acquird by culture or if containd in the blood of those that are nobly born imperceptible till the years of discretion and neither of them can be said of the principle the palpable cause i speak of for we plainly see on the one hand that scorn and ridicule are intollerable to the poorest wretches and that there is no beggar so mean or miserable that contempt will never offend him on the other that human creatures are so early influenced by the sense of shame that children by being laughd at and made a jest of may be set a crying before they can well   speak or go whatever therefore this mighty principle is it is born with us and belongs to our nature are you unacquainted with the proper genuine homely name of it hor i know you call it pride i wont dispute with you about principles and origins of things but that high value which men of honour set upon themselves as such and which is no more than what is due to the dignity of our nature when well cultivated  0 is the foundation of their character and a support to them in all difficulties that is of great use to the society the desire likewise of being thought well of and the love of praise and even of glory are commendable qualities that are beneficial to the publick the truth of this is manifest in the reverse all shameless people that are below infamy and matter not what is said or thought of them these we see no body can trust they stick at nothing and if they can but avoid death pain and penal laws are always ready to execute all manner of mischief their selfishness or any brutal appetite shall prompt them to without regard to the opinion of others such are justly calld men of no principles because they have nothing of any strength within that can either spur them on to brave and virtuous actions or restrain them from villainy and baseness    cleo the first part of your assertion is very true when that high value that desire and that love are kept within the bounds of reason but in the second there is a mistake those whom we call shameless are not more destitute of pride than their betters remember what i have said of education and the power of it you may add inclinations knowledge and circumstances for as men differ in all these so they are differently influenced and wrought upon by all the passions there is nothing that some men may not be taught to be ashamed of the same passion that makes the wellbred man and prudent officer value and secretly admire themselves for the honour and fidelity they display may make the rake and scoundrel brag of their vices and boast of their impudence hor i cannot comprehend how a man of honour and one that has none should both act from the same principle cleo this is not more strange than that selflove may make a man destroy himself yet nothing is more    true and it is as certain that some men indulge their pride in being shameless to understand human nature requires study and application as well as penetration and sagacity all passions and instincts in general were given to all animals for some wise end tending to the preservation and happiness either of themselves or   their species it is our duty to hinder them from being detrimental or offensive to any part of the society but why should we be ashamed of having them the instinct of high value which every individual has for himself is a very useful passion but a passion it is and though i could demonstrate that we should be miserable creatures without it yet when it is excessive it often is the cause of endless mischiefs hor but in wellbred people it never is excessive cleo you mean the excess of it never appears outwardly but we ought never to judge of its height or strength from what we can discover of the passion itself but from the effects it produces it often is most superlative where it is most conceald and nothing increases and influences it more than what is calld a refind education and a continual commerce with the beau monde the only thing that can subdue or any ways curb it is a strict adherence to the christian religion hor why do you so much insist upon it that this principle this value men set upon themselves is a passion and why will you chuse to call it pride rather than honour cleo for very good reasons fixing this principle in human nature in the first place takes away all ambiguity who is a man of honour and who is not is often a disputable   point and among those that are allowd to be such the several degrees of strictness in complying with the rules of it make great difference in the principle itself but a passion that is born with us is unalterable and part of our    frame whether it exerts itself or not the essence of it is the same which way soever it is taught to turn honour is the undoubted offspring of pride but the same cause produces not always the same effect all the vulgar children savages and many others that are not affected with any sense of honour have all of them pride as is evident from the symptoms secondly it helps us to explain the phænomena that occur in quarrels and affronts and the behaviour of men of honour on these occasions which cannot be accounted for any other way but what moves me to it most of all is the prodigious force and exorbitant power of this principle of selfesteem where it has been long gratifyd and encouragd you remember the concern you was under when you had that duel upon your hands and the great reluctancy you felt in doing what you did you knew it to be a crime and at the same time had a strong aversion to it what secret power was it that subdued your will and gaind the victory over that great reluctancy you felt against it you call it honour and the too strict though unavoidable adherence to the rules of it but men ne  ver commit violence upon themselves but in struggling with the passions that are innate and natural to them honour is acquird and the rules of it are taught nothing adventitious that some are possessd and others destitute of could raise such intestine wars and dire commotions within us and therefore whatever is the cause that can thus divide us against ourselves and as it were rend human nature in twain must be part of us and to speak without disguise the struggle in your breast was between the fear of shame and the fear of death had this latter not been so considerable your struggle would have been less still the first conquered because it was strongest but if your fear of shame had been inferior to that of death you would have reasond otherwise and found out some means or other to have avoided fighting    hor this is a strange anatomy of human nature cleo yet for want of making use of it the subject we are upon is not rightly understood by many and men have discoursd very inconsistently on duelling a divine who wrote a dialogue to explode that practice  said that those who were guilty of it had mistaken notions of and went by false rules of honour for which my friend justly ridiculd him saying you may as well deny that it is the fashion what you see every body wear   as to say that demanding and giving satisfaction is against the law of true honour  had that man understood human nature he could not have committed such a blunder but when once he took it for granted that honour is a just and good principle without enquiring into the cause of it among the passions it is impossible he should have accounted for duelling in a christian pretending to act from such a principle and therefore in another place with the same justice he said that a man who had accepted a challenge was not qualifyd to make his will because he was not compos mentis  he might with greater shew of reason have said that he was bewitchd hor why so cleo because people out of their wits as they think at random so commonly they act and talk incoherently but when a man of known sobriety and who shews no manner of discomposure discourses and behaves himself in every thing as he is used to do and moreover reasons on points of great nicety with the utmost accuracy it is impossible we should    take him to be either a fool or a madman and when such a person in an affair of the highest importance acts so diametrically against his interest that a child can see it and with deliberation pursues his own destruction those who believe that there are malignant spirits of that power would rather imagine that   he was led away by some enchantment and overruld by the enemy of mankind than they would fancy a palpable absurdity but even the supposition of that is not sufficient to solve the difficulty without the help of that strange anatomy for what spell or witchcraft is there by the delusion of which a man of understanding shall keeping his senses mistake an imaginary duty for an unavoidable necessity to break all real obligations but let us wave all ties of religion as well as human laws and the person we speak of be a professd epicure that has no thoughts of futurity what violent power of darkness is it that can force and compel a peaceable quiet man neither inured to hardship nor valiant by nature to quit his beloved ease and security and seemingly by choice goa fight in cold blood for his life with this comfortable reflection that nothing forfeits it so certainly as the entire defeat of his enemy hor as to the law and the punishment persons of quality have little to fear of that cleo you cant say that in france  nor the seven provinces  but men of honour that are of much lower ranks decline duelling no more than those of the highest quality how many examples have we even here of gallant men that have sufferd for it either by exile or the hangman a man of honour    must fear nothing do but consider   every obstacle which this principle of selfesteem has conquerd at one time or other and then tell me whether it must not be something more than magick by the fascination of which a man of taste and judgment in health and vigour as well as the flower of his age can be tempted and actually drawn from the embraces of a wife he loves and the endearments of hopeful children from polite conversation and the charms of friendship from the fairest possessions and the happy enjoyment of all worldly pleasures to an unwarrantable combat of which the victor must be exposed either to an ignominious death or perpetual banishment hor when things are set in this light i confess it is very unaccountable but will your system explain this can you make it clear your self cleo immediately as the sun if you will but observe two things that must necessarily follow and are manifest from what i have demonstrated already the first is that the fear of shame in general is a matter of caprice that varies with modes and customs and may be fixd on different objects according to the different lessons we have receivd and the precepts we are imbued with and that this is the reason why this fear of shame as it is either well or illplaced sometimes produces very good effects and at others is the cause of the most enormous crimes se 0condly that tho shame is a real passion the evil to be feard from it is altogether imaginary and has no existence but in our own reflection on the opinion of others hor but there are real and substantial mischiefs which a man may draw upon himself by misbehaving in point of honour it may ruin his fortune and all hopes of preferment an officer may be broken for putting up an affront no body will serve with a coward and who will employ him    cleo what you urge is altogether out of the question at least it was in your own case you had nothing to dread or apprehend but the bare opinion of men besides when the fear of shame is superior to that of death it is likewise superior to and outweighs all other considerations as has been sufficiently proved but when the fear of shame is not violent enough to curb the fear of death nothing else can and whenever the fear of death is stronger than that of shame there is no consideration that will make a man fight in cold blood or comply with any of the laws of honour where life is at stake therefore whoever acts from the fear of shame as a motive in sending and accepting of challenges must be sensible on the one hand that the mischiefs he apprehends should he disobey the tyrant can only be the offspring of his own thoughts and on the other that if he could be persuaded any ways   to lessen the great esteem and high value he sets upon himself his dread of shame would likewise palpably diminish from all which it is most evident that the grand cause of this distraction the powerful enchanter we are seeking after is pride excess of pride that highest pitch of selfesteem to which some men may be wound up by an artful education and the perpetual flatteries bestowd upon our species and the excellencies of our nature this is the sorcerer that is able to divert all other passions from their natural objects and make a rational creature ashamed of what is most agreeable to his inclination as well as his duty both which the duellist owns that he has knowingly acted against hor what a wonderful machine what an heterogeneous compound is man you have almost conquerd me cleo i aim at no victory all i wish for is to do you service in undeceiving you hor what is the reason that in the same person    the fear of death should be so glaringly conspicuous in sickness or a storm and so entirely well hid in a duel and all military engagements pray solve that too cleo i will as well as i can on all emergencies where reputation is thought to be concernd the fear of shame is effectually rousd in men of honour and immediately their pride rushes in to their assistance and summons all their strength to fortify and sup  port them in concealing the fear of death by which extraordinary efforts the latter that is the fear of death is altogether stifled or at least kept out of sight and remains undiscoverd but in all other perils in which they dont think their honour engaged their pride lies dormant and thus the fear of death being checkd by nothing appears without disguise that this is the reason is manifest from the different behaviour that is observd in men of honour according as they are either pretenders to christianity or tainted with irreligion for there are of both sorts and you shall see most commonly at least that your esprits forts and those who would be thought to disbelieve a future state i speak of men of honour shew the greatest calmness and intrepidity in the same dangers where the pretended believers among them appear to be the most ruffled and pusillanimous hor but why pretended believers at that rate there are no christians among the men of honour cleo i dont see how they can be real believers hor why so cleo for the same reason that a roman catholick cannot be a good subject always to be depended upon in a protestant or indeed any other country but the dominions of his holiness no sovereign can confide with safety in a mans allegiance who owns and   pays homage to another superior power upon earth i am sure you understand me hor too well    cleo you may yoke a knight with a prebendary and put them together into the same stall but honour and the christian religion make no couple nec in unâ sede morantur  any more than majesty and love look back on your own conduct and you shall find that what you said of the hand of god  was only a shift an evasion you made to serve your then present purpose on another occasion  you had said yesterday yourself that providence superintends and governs every thing without exception you must therefore have known that the hand of god is as much to be seen in one common accident in life and in one misfortune as it is in another that is not more extraordinary a severe fit of sickness may be less fatal than a slight skirmish between two hostile parties and among men of honour there is often as much danger in a quarrel about nothing as there can be in the most violent storm it is impossible therefore that a man of sense who has a solid principle to go by should in one sort of danger think it impiety not to shew fear and in another be ashamed to be thought to have any do but consider your own inconsistency with yourself at one time to justify your fear of death when pride is absent you become religious on a sudden and your consci  ence then is so tenderly scrupulous that to be undaunted under chastisements from the almighty seems no less to you than waging war with heaven and at another when honour calls you dare not only knowingly and wilfully break the most positive command of god but likewise to own that the greatest calamity which in your opinion can befall you is that the world should believe or but suspect of you that you had any scruple about it i defy the wit of man to carry the affront to the divine majesty higher barely to deny his being is not half so daring    as it is to do this after you have ownd him to exist no atheism hor hold cleomenes i can no longer resist the force of truth and i am resolved to be better acquainted with myself for the future let me become your pupil cleo dont banter me horatio i dont pretend to instruct a man of your knowledge but if you will take my advice search into yourself with care and boldness and at your leisure peruse the book i recommended hor i promise you i will and shall be glad to accept of the handsome present i refusd pray send a servant with it to morrowmorning cleo its a trifle you had better let one of yours go with me now i shall drive home directly hor i understand your scruple it shall be as you please  00 the third dialogue   the third dialogue between horatio and cleomenes h o r a t i o i thank you for your book cleo your acceptance of it i acknowledge as a great favour hor i confess that once i thought no body could have persuaded me to read it but you managed me very skilfully and nothing could have convinced me so well as the instance of duelling the argument a majori ad minus struck me without your mentioning it a passion that can subdue the fear of death may blind a mans understanding and do almost every thing else cleo it is incredible what strange various unaccountable and contradictory forms we may be shaped into by a passion that is not to be gratifyd without being conceald and never enjoyd with greater ecstasy than   when we are most fully persuaded that it is well hid and therefore there is no  0  benevolence or good nature no amiable quality or social virtue that may not be counterfeited by it and in short no atchievment good or bad that the human body or mind are capable of which it may not seem to perform as to its blinding and infatuating the persons possessd with it to a high degree there is no doubt of it for what strength of reason i pray what judgment or penetration has the greatest genius if he pretends to any religion to boast of after he has ownd himself to have been more terrifyd by groundless apprehensions and an imaginary evil from vain impotent men whom he has never injured than he was alarmd with the just fears of a real punishment from an allwise and omnipotent god whom he has highly offendeda hor but your friend makes no such religious reflections he actually speaks in favour of duelling cleo what because he would have the laws against it as severe as possible and no body pardond without exception that offends that way hor that indeed seems to discourage it but he shews the necessity of keeping up that custom to polish and brighten society in general cleo dont you see the irony there    hor no indeed he plainly demonstrates the usefulness of it gives as good reasons as it is possible to invent and shews how much conversation would suffer if that practice was abolished cleo can you think a man serious on a subject when he leaves it in the manner he does hor i dont remember that cleo here is the book ill look for the passage —— pray read this hor it is strange that a nation should grudge to see perhaps half a dozen men sacrifised in a twelvemonth to obtain so valuable a blessing as the politeness of manners the pleasure of conversation and the happiness of company in general that is often so willing to expose  0  and sometimes loses as many thousands in a few hours without knowing whether it will do any good or not  this indeed seems to be said with a sneer but in what goes before he is very serious cleo he is so when he says that the practice of duelling that is the keeping up of the fashion of it contributes to the politeness of manners and pleasure of conversation and this is very true but that politeness itself and that pleasure are the things he laughs at and exposes throughout his book hor but who knows what to make of a man who recommends a thing very seriously in one page and ridicules it in the next    cleo it is his opinion that there is no solid principle to go by but the christian religion and that few embrace it with sincerity always look upon him in this view and youll never find him inconsistent with himself whenever at first sight he seems to be so look again and upon nearer enquiry youll find that he is only pointing at or labouring to detect the inconsistency of others with the principles they pretend to hor he seems to have nothing less at heart than religion cleo thats true and if he had appeard otherwise he would never have been read by the people whom he designd his book for the modern deists  and all the beau monde it is those he wants to come at to the first he sets forth the origin and insufficiency of virtue and their own insincerity in the practice of it to the rest he shews the folly of vice and pleasure the vanity of worldly greatness and the hypocrisy of all those divines who pretending to preach the gospel give and take allowances that are inconsistent with and quite contrary to the precepts of it  0  hor but this is not the opinion the world has of the book it is commonly imagind that it is wrote for the encouragement of vice and to debauch the nation  cleo have you found any such thing in it hor to speak my conscience i must confess i have not vice is exposd in it and   laughd at but it ridicules war and martial courage as well as honour and every thing else cleo pardon me religion is ridiculed in no part of it hor but if it is a good book why then are so many of the clergy so much against it as they are cleo for the reason i have given you my friend has exposd their lives but he has done it in such a manner that no body can say he has wrongd them or treated them harshly people are never more vexd than when the thing that offends them is what they must not complain of they give the book an ill name because they are angry but it is not their interest to tell you the true reason why they are so i could draw you a parallel case that would clear up this matter if you would have patience to hear me which as you are a great admirer of operas i can hardly expect hor any thing to be informd cleo i always had such an aversion to eunuchs as no fine singing or acting of any of them has yet been able to conquer when i hear a feminine voice i look for a petticoat and i perfectly loath the sight of those sexless animals suppose that a man with the same dislike to them had wit at will and a mind to lash that abominable piece of luxury by which men are taughta in cold blood to spoil males for diversion and out of wantonness  00to make waste of their own species in order to this well say he takes a handle from the operation itself he describes and  0  treats it in the most inoffensive manner then shews the narrow bounds of human knowledge and the small assistance we can have either from dissection or philosophy or any part of the mathematicks to trace and penetrate into the cause a priori why this destroying of manhood should have that surprizing effect upon the voice and afterwards demonstrates how sure we are a posteriori that it has a considerable influence not only on the pharinx the glands and muscles of the throat but likewise the windpipe and the lungs themselves and in short on the whole mass of blood and consequently all the juices of the body and every fibre in it he might say likewise that no honey no preparations of sugar raisins or sperma ceti no emulsions lozenges or other medicines cooling or balsamick no bleeding no temperance or choice in eatables no abstinence from women from wine and every thing that is hot sharp or spirituous were of that efficacy to preserve sweeten and strengthen the voice he might insist upon it that nothing could do this so effectually as castration for a blind to his main scope and to amuse his readers he might speak of this practice as made use of for other purposes that it had been inflicted as a solemn punishment for analogous  0 crimes that others had voluntarily submitted to it to preserve health and prolong life whilst the romans by cæsars testimony thought it more cruel than death morte gravius  how it had been used sometimes by way of revenge and then say something in pity of poor abelard at other times for precaution and then relate the story of combabus and stratonice  with scraps from martial juvenal and other poets he might interlard it and from a thousand pleasant  0  things that have been said on the subject he might pick out the most diverting to embellish the whole his design being satyr he would blame our fondness for these castrati and ridicule the age in which a brave english nobleman and a general officer serves his country at the hazard of his life a whole twelvemonth for less pay than an italian noman of scoundrel extraction receives for now and then singing a song in great safety during only the winter season  he would laugh at the caresses and the court that are made to them by persons of the first quality who prostitute their familiarity with these most abject wretches and misplace the honour and civilities only due to their equals on things that are no part of the creation and owe their being to the surgeon animals so contemptible that they can curse their maker without ingratitude if he should call this book the eunuch is the man as soon  0 as i heard the title before i saw the book i should understand by it that eunuchs were now esteemd that they were in fashion and in the publick favour and considering that a eunuch is in reality not a man i should think it was a banter upon eunuchs or a satyr against those who had a greater value for them than they deservd but if the gentlemen of the academy of musick  displeasd at the freedom they were treated with should take it ill that a paultry scribler should  0  interfere and pretend to censure their diversion as well they might if they should be very angry and study to do him a mischief and accordingly not having much to say in behalf of eunuchs not touch upon any thing the author had said against their pleasure but represent him to the world as an advocate for castration and endeavour to draw the publick odium upon him by quotations taken from him proper for that purpose it would not be difficult to raise a clamour against the author or find a grand jury to present his book hor the simile holds very well as to the injustice of the accusation and the insincerity of the complaint but is it as true that luxury will render a nation flourishing and that private vices are publick benefits as that castration preserves and strengthens the voice cleo with the restrictions my friend requires i believe it is and the cases are ex 0 actly alike nothing is more effectual to preserve mend and strengthen a fine voice in youth than castration the question is not whether this is true but whether it is eligible whether a fine voice is an equivalent for the loss and whether a man would prefer the satisfaction of singing and the advantages that may accrue from it to the comforts of marriage and the pleasure of posterity of which enjoyments it destroys the possibility in like manner my friend demonstrates in the first place that the national happiness which the generality wish and pray for is wealth and power glory and worldly greatness to live in ease in affluence and splendour at home and to be feard courted and esteemd abroad in the second that such a felicity is not to be attaind to without avarice profuseness pride envy ambition and other vices the latter being made evident beyond contradiction the question is not whether it is true but whether this happiness is worth having at the rate it is only to be had at and whether any thing ought  0  to be wishd for which a nation cannot enjoy unless the generality of them are vicious this he offers to the consideration of christians and men who pretend to have renouncd the world with all the pomp and vanity of it hor how does it appear that the author addresses himself to such  0  cleo from his writing it in english and publishing it in london but have you read it through yet hor twice there are many things i like very well but i am not pleasd with the whole cleo what objections have you against it hor it has diminishd the pleasure i had in reading a much better book lord shaftsbury is my favourite author i can take delight in enthusiasma  but the charms of it cease as soon as i am told what it is i enjoy since we are such odd creatures why should we not make the most of it cleo i thought you was resolvd to be better acquainted with yourself and to search into your heart with care and boldness hor thats a cruel thing i tried it three times since i saw you last till it put me into a sweat and then i was forced to leave off  cleo you should try again and use yourself by  0  degrees to think abstractly and then the book will be a great help to you hor to confound me it will it makes a jest of all politeness and good manners cleo excuse me sir it only tells us what they are hor it tells us that all good manners consist in flattering the pride of others and concealing our own  is not that a horrid thing cleo but is it not true  0  hor as soon as i had read that passage it struck me down i laid the book and tryd in above fifty instances sometimes of civility and sometimes of ill manners whether it would answer or not and i profess that it held good in every one cleo and so it would if you tryd till doomsday hor but is not that provoking id give a hundred guineas with all my heart that i did not know it i cant endure to see so much of my own nakedness cleo i never met with such an open enmity to truth in a man of honour before hor you shall be as severe upon me as you please what i say is fact but since i am got in so far i must go through with it now there are fifty things that i want to be informd about cleo name them pray if i can be of any service to you i shall reckon it as a great honour i am perfectly well acquainted with the authors sentiments hor i have twenty questions to ask about pride and i dont know where to begin theres another thing i dont understand which is that there can be no virtue without selfdenial cleo this was the opinion of all the ancients lord shaftsbury was the first that maintaind the contrary   0  hor but are there no persons in the world that are good by choice  0  cleo yes but then they are directed in that choice by reason and experience and not by nature i mean not by untaught nature but there is an ambiguity in the word good which i would avoid let us stick to that of virtuous and then i affirm that no action is such which does not suppose and point at some conquest or other some victory great or small over untaught nature otherwise the epithet is improper hor but if by the help of a careful education this victory is obtaind when we are young may we not be virtuous afterwards voluntarily and with pleasure cleo yes if it really was obtaind but how shall we be sure of this and what reason have we to believe that it ever was when it is evident that from our infancy instead of endeavouring to conquer our appetites we have always been taught and have taken pains ourselves to conceal them and we are conscious within that whatever alterations have been made in our manners and our circumstances the passions themselves always remaind the system that virtue requires no selfdenial is as my friend has justly observd a vast inlet to hypocrisy  it will on all accounts furnish men with a more obvious handle and a greater opportunity of counterfeiting the love of society and regard to the  0 publick than ever they could have receivd from the contrary doctrine viz that there is no merit but in the conquest of the passions nor any virtue without apparent selfdenial let us ask those that have had long experience and are well skilld in human affairs whether they have found the generality of men such impartial judges of themselves as never to think better of their own worth than it deservd or so candid in the acknowledgment of their hidden faults and slips they could never be convincd of that there is no fear they should ever stifle or deny them where is the man that has at no time covered his failings and   0 skreened himself with false appearances or never pretended to act from principles of social virtue and his regard to others when he knew in his heart that his greatest care had been to oblige himself the best of us sometimes receive applause without undeceiving those who give it tho at the same time we are conscious that the actions for which we suffer ourselves to be thought well of are the result of a powerful frailty in our nature that has often been prejudicial to us and which we have wishd a thousand times in vain that we could have conquerd the same motives may produce very different actions as men differ in temper and circumstances persons of an easy fortune may appear virtuous from the same turn of mind that would shew their  0 frailty if they were poor if we would know the world we must look into it you take no delight in the occurrences of low life but if we always remain among persons of quality and extend our enquiries no farther the transactions there will not furnish us with a sufficient knowledge of every thing that belongs to our nature there are among the midling people men of low circumstances tolerablya well educated that set out with the same stock of virtues and vices and tho equally qualifyd meet with very different success visibly owing to the difference in their temper let us take a view of two persons bred to the same business that have nothing but their parts and the world before them launching out with the same helps and disadvantages let there be no difference between them but in their temper the one active and the other indolent the latter will never get an estate by his own industry tho his profession be gainful and himself master of it chance or some uncommon accident may be the occasion of great alterations in him but without that he will hardly ever raise himself to mediocrityb unless his pride affects him in     an extraordinary manner he must always be poor and nothing but some share of vanity can hinder him from being despicably so if he be a man of sense hell be strictly honest and a midling stock of covetousness will never di 0 vert him from it in the active stirring man that is easily reconcild to the bustle of the world we shall discover quite different symptoms under the same circumstances and a very little avarice will egg him on to pursue his aim with eagerness and assiduity small scruples are no opposition to him where sinceritya will not serve he uses artifice and in compassing his ends the greatest use he will make of his good sense will be to preserve as much as is possible the appearance of honesty when his interest obliges him to deviate from it to get wealth or even a livelihood by arts and sciences it is not sufficient to understandb them it is a duty incumbent on all men who have their maintenance to seek to make known and forward themselves in the world as far as decency allows of without bragging of themselves or doing prejudice to others here the indolent man is very deficient and wanting to himself but seldom will own his fault and often blames the publick for not making use of him and encouraging that merit which they never were acquainted with and himself perhaps took pleasure to conceal and tho you convince him of his error and that he has neglected even the most warrantable methods of solliciting employment hell endeavour to colour over his frailty with the appearance of virtue and what is altogether owing to his too easy temper and an   0excessive fondness for the calmness of his mind hell ascribe to his modesty and the great aversion he has to impudence and boasting the man of a contrary temper trusts not to his merit only or the setting it off to the best advantage he takes pains to heighten it in the opinion of others and make his abilities seem greater than he     knows them to be as it is counted folly for a man to proclaim his own excellencies and speak magnificently of himself so his chief business is to seek acquaintance and make friends on purpose to do it for him all other passions he sacrifices to his ambition he laughs at disappointments is inured to refusals and no repulse dismays him this renders the whole man always flexible to his interest he can defraud his body of necessaries and allow no tranquility to his mind and counterfeit if it will serve his turn temperance chastity compassion and piety itself without one grain of virtue or religion his endeavours to advance his fortune per fas  nefas are always restless and have no bounds but where he is obligd to act openly and has reason to fear the censure of the world it is very diverting to see how in the different persons i speak of natural temper will warp and model the very passions to its own biass pride for example has not the same but almost a quite contrary effect on the one to what it has on the other the    stirring active man it makes in love with finery cloaths furniture equipages building and every thing his superiors enjoy the other it renders sullen and perhaps morose and if he has wit prone to satyr tho he be otherwise a goodnaturd man selflove in every individual ever bestirs itself in soothing and flattering the darling inclination always turning from us the dismal side of the prospect and the indolent man in such circumstances finding nothing pleasing without turns his view inward upon himself and there looking on every thing with great indulgence admires and takes delight in his own parts whether natural or acquired hence he is easily induced to despise all others who have not the same good qualifications especially the powerful and wealthy whom yet he never hates or envies with any violence because that would ruffle his temper all things that are difficult he looks     upon as impossible which makes him despair of meliorating his condition and as he has no possessions and his gettings will but just maintain him in a low station of life so his good sense if he would enjoy so much as the appearance of happiness must necessarily put him upon two things to be frugal and pretend to have no value for riches for by neglecting either he must be blown up and his frailty unavoidably discoverd     hor i am pleasd with your observations and the knowledge you display of mankind but pray is not the frugality you now speak ofa a virtue cleo i think not hor where there is but a small income frugality is built upon reason and in this case there is an apparent selfdenial without which an indolent man that has no value for money cannot be frugal and when we see indolent men that have no regard for wealth reduced to beggery as it often happens it is most commonly for want of this virtue cleo i told you before that the indolent man setting out as he did would be poor and that nothing but some share of vanity could hinder him from being despicably so a strong fear of shame may gain so much upon the indolence of a man of sense that hell bestir himself sufficiently to escape contempt but it will hardly make him do any more therefore he embraces frugality as being instrumental and assisting to him in procuring his summum bonum the darling quiet of his easy mind whereas the active man with the same share of vanity would do any thing rather than submit to the same frugality unless his avarice forcd him to it frugality is no virtue when it is imposed upon us by any of the passions and the contempt of riches is seldom sincere i have known men of plentiful estates that on ac   count of posterity or other warrantable views of employing their money     were saving and more penurious than they would have been if their wealth had been greater but i never yet found a frugal man without avarice or necessity and again there are innumerable spendthrifts lavish and extravagant to a high degree who seem not to have the least regard to money whilst they have any to fling away but these wretches are the least capable of bearing poverty of any and the money once gone hourly discover how uneasy impatient and miserable they are without it but what several in all ages have made pretence to the contempt of riches is more scarce than is commonly imagind to see a man of a very good estate in health and strength of body and mind one that has no reason to complain of the world or fortune actually despise both and embrace a voluntary poverty for a laudable purpose is a great rarity i know but one in all antiquity to whom all this may be applied with strictness of truth hor who is that pray cleo anaxagoras of clazomene in ionia he was very rich of noble extraction and admired for his great capacity he divided and gave away his estate among his relations and refusd to meddle with the administration of publick affairs that was offerd him for no other reason than that he might have more    leisure for contemplation on the works of nature and the study of philosophy hor to me it seems to be more difficult to be virtuous without money than with it is senseless for a man to be poor when he can help it and if i saw any body chuse it when he might as lawfully be rich i would think him to be distracted cleo but you would not think him so if you saw him sell his estate and give the money to the poor you know where that was required hor it is not required of us cleo perhaps not but what say you to renouncing     the world and the solemn promise we have made of it hor in a literal sense that is impossible unless we go out of it and therefore i dont think that to renounce the world signifies any more than not to comply with the vicious wicked part of it cleo i did not expect a more rigid construction from you tho it is certain that wealth and power are great snares and strong impediments to all christian virtue but the generality of mankind that have any thing to lose are of your opinion and let us bar saints and madmen we shall find everywhere that those who pretend to undervalue and are always haranguing against wealth are generally poor and indolent but who can blame    them they act in their own defence no body that could help it would ever be laughd at for it must be ownd that of all the hardships of poverty it is that which is the most intollerable   nil habet infelix paupertas durius in se   quam quod ridiculos homines faciat  in the very satisfaction that is enjoyd by those who excel in or are possessd of things valuable there is interwoven a spice of contempt for others that are destitute of them which nothing keeps from publick view but a mixture of pity and good manners whoever denies this let them consult within and examine whether it is not the same with happiness as what seneca says of the reverse nemo est miser nisi comparatus  the contempt and ridicule i speak of is without doubt what all men of sense and education endeavour to avoid or disappoint now look upon the behaviour of the two contrary tempers before us and mind how differently they set about this task every one suitably to his own inclination the man of action you see leaves no stone unturnd     to acquire quod oportet habere but this is impossible for the indolent he cant stir his idol ties him down hand and foot and therefore the easiest and indeed the only thing he has left is to quarrel with the world and find out arguments to depreciate what others value themselves upon     hor i now plainly see how pride and good sense must put an indolent man that is poor upon frugality and likewise the reason why they will make him affect to be content and seem pleased with his low condition for if he wont be frugal want and misery are at the door and if he shews any fondness for riches or a more ample way of living he loses the only plea he has for his darling frailty and immediately hell be askd why he dont exert himself in a better manner and hell be continually told of the opportunities he neglects cleo it is evident then that the true reasons why men speak against things are not always writ upon their foreheads hor but after all this quiet easy temper this indolence you talk of is ita not what in plain english we call laziness cleo not at all it implies no sloth or aversion to labour an indolent man may be very diligent tho he cannot be industrious he will take up with things below him if they come in his way hell work in a garret or any where else remote from publick view with patience and assiduity but he knows not how to sollicit and teaze others to employ him or demand his due of a shuffling designing master that is either difficult of access or tenacious of his money if he be a man of letters hell study hard for a livelihood but generally parts with his labours at a dis   advantage and will knowingly sell them at an underrate to an obscure man who offers to purchase rather than bear the insults of haughty     booksellers and be plagued with the sordid language of the trade an indolent man may by chance meet with a person of quality that takes a fancy to him but he will never get a patron by his own address neither will he ever be the better for it when he has one further than the unaskdfor bounty and downright generosity of his benefactor make him as he speaks for himself with reluctancy and is always afraid of asking favours so for benefits receivd he shews no other gratitude than what the natural emotions of his heart suggest to him the striving active man studies all the winning ways to ingratiate himself and hunts after patrons with design and sagacity whilst they are beneficial to him he affects a perpetual sense of thankfulness but all his acknowledgments of past obligations he turns into sollicitations for fresh favours his complaisance may be engaging and his flattery ingenious but the heart is untouchd he has neither leisure nor the power to love his benefactors the eldest he has he will always sacrifize to a new one and he has no other esteem for the fortune the greatness or the credit of a patron than as he can make them subservient either to raise or maintain his own from all this and a little attention on human    affairs we may easily perceive in the first place that the man of action and an enterprizing temper in following the dictates of his nature must meet with more rubs and obstacles infinitely than the indolent and a multitude of strong temptations to deviate from the rules of strict virtue which hardly ever come in the others way that in many circumstances hell be forcd to commit such actions for which all his skill and prudence notwithstanding he will by some body or other deservedly be thought to be an ill man and that to end with a tolerable reputation after a long course of life he must have had a great deal of good fortune as well as cunning secondly that     the indolent man may indulge his inclinations and be as sensual as his circumstances will let him with little offence or disturbance to his neighbour that the excessive value he sets upon the tranquility of his mind and the grand aversion he has to part with it must prove a strong curb to every passion that comes uppermost none of which by this means can ever affect him in any high degree and consequently that the corruption of his heart remaining he may with little art and no great trouble acquire many amiable qualities that shall have all the appearances of social virtues whilst nothing extraordinary befalls him as to his contempt of the world the indolent man perhaps will scorn to make his    and cringe to a haughty favourite that will browbeat him at first but hell run with joy to a rich nobleman that he is sure will receive him with kindness and humanity with him hell partake without reluctancy of all the elegant comforts of life that are offerd the most expensive not excepted would you try him further confer upon him honour and wealth in abundance if this change in his fortune stirs up no vice that lay dormant before as it may by rendring him either covetous or extravagant he will soon conform himself to the fashionable world perhaps hell be a kind master an indulgent father a benevolent neighbour munificent to merit that pleases him a patron to virtue and a wellwisher to his country but for the rest hell take all the pleasure he is capable of enjoying stifle no passion he can calmly gratify and in the midst of a luxurious plenty laugh heartily at frugality and the contempt of riches and greatness he professd in his poverty and chearfully own the futility of those pretences hor i am convincd that in the opinion of virtues requiring selfdenial there is greater certainty and hypocrites have less latitude than in the contrary system     cleo whoever follows his own inclinations be they never so kind beneficent or humane never quarrels with any vice but what is clashing with his temperament and na  0ture whereas those who act from a principle of virtue take always reason for their guide and combat without exception every passion that hinders them from their duty the indolent man will never deny a just debt but if it be large he will not give himself the trouble which poor as he is he might and ought to take to discharge it or at least satisfy his creditor unless he is often dunnd or threatend to be sued for it he will not be a litigious neighbour nor make mischief among his acquaintance but he will never serve his friend or his country at the expence of his quiet he will not be rapacious oppress the poor or commit vile actions for lucre but then he will never exert himself and be at the pains another would take on all opportunities to maintain a large family make provision for children and promote his kindred and relations and his darling frailty will incapacitate him from doing a thousand things for the benefit of the society which with the same parts and opportunities he might and would have done had he been of another temper hor your observations are very curious and as far as i can judge from what i have seen myself very just and natural cleo every body knows that there is no virtue so often counterfeited as charity and yet so little regard have the generality of men to truth that how gross and barefaced soever    the deceit is in pretences of this nature the world never fails of being angry with and hating those who detect or take notice of the fraud it is possible that with blind fortune on his side a mean shopkeeper by driving a trade prejudicial to his country on the one hand and grinding on all occasions the face of the poor on the other   0 may accumulate great wealth which in process of time by continual scraping and sordid saving may be raised into an exorbitant anda unheardof estate for a tradesman should such a one when old and decrepit lay out the greatest part of his immense riches in the building or largely endowing an hospital and i was thoroughly acquainted with his temper and manners i could have no opinion of his virtue tho he parted with the money whilst he was yet alive more especially if i was assured that in his last will he had been highly unjust and had not only left unrewarded several whom he had great obligations to but likewise defrauded others to whom in his conscience he knew that he was and would die actually indebted i desire you to tell me what name knowing all i have said to be true you would give to this extraordinary gift this mighty donation  hor i am of opinion that when an action of our neighbour may admit of different constructions it is our duty to side with and embrace the most favourable     cleo the most favourable constructionb with all my heart but what is that to the purpose when all the straining in the world cannot make it a good one i dont mean the thing it self but the principle it came from the inward motive of the mind that put him upon performing it for it is that which in a free agent i call the action and therefore call it what you please and judge as charitably of it as you can what can you say of it hor he might have had several motives which i dont pretend to determine but it is an admirable contrivance of being extremely beneficial to all posterity in this land a noble provision that will perpetually relieve and be an unspeakable comfort to a multitude of miserable people and it is not only a prodigious but likewise a wellconcerted bounty     that was wanting and for which in afterages thousands of poor wretches will have reason to bless his memory when every body else shall have neglected them cleo all that i have nothing against and if you would add more i shant dispute it with you as long as you confine your praises to the endowment it self and the benefit the publick is like to receive from it but to ascribe it to or suggest that it was derived from a publick spirit in the man a generous sense of humanity and benevolence to his kind a liberal heart or any other virtue or good quality which it is manifest the donor was    an utter stranger to is the utmost absurdity in an intelligent creature and can proceed from no other cause than either a wilful wronging of his own understanding or else ignorance and folly hor i am persuaded that many actions are put off for virtuous that are not so and that according as men differ in natural temper and turn of mind so they are differently influencd by the same passions i believe likewise that these last are born with us and belong to our nature that some of them are in us or at least the seeds of them before we perceive them but since they are in every individual how comes it that pride is more predominant in some than it is in others for from what you have demonstrated already it must follow that one person is more affected with the passion within than another i mean that one man has actually a greater share of pride than another as well among the artful that are dextrous in concealing it as among the illbred that openly shew it cleo what belongs to our nature all men may justly be said to have actually or virtually in them at their birth and whatever is not born with us either the thing it self or that which afterwards produces it cannot be said to belong to our nature but as we differ in our faces and stature so we do in other things that are more remote from sight but all     these depend only upon the different frame    the inward formation of either the solids or the fluids and there are vices of complexion that are peculiar some to the pale and phlegmatick others to the sanguine and cholerick  some are more lustful others more fearful in their nature than the generality are but i believe of man generally speaking what my friend has observd of other creatures that the best of the kind i mean the best formd within such as have the finest natural parts are born with the greatest aptitude to be proud but i am convinced that the difference there is in men as to the degrees of their pride is more owing to circumstances and education than any thing in their formation where passions are most gratifyd and least contrould the indulgence makes them stronger whereas those persons that have been kept under and whose thoughts have never been at liberty to rove beyond the first necessaries of life such as have not been sufferd or had no opportunity to gratify this passion have commonly the least share of it but whatever portion of pride a man may feel in his heart the quicker his parts are the better his understanding is and the more experience he has the more plainly hell perceive the aversion which all men have to those that discover their pride and the sooner persons are imbued with good manners the sooner they grow perfect in concealing that passion men of mean birth    and education that have been kept in great subjection and consequently had no great opportunities to exert their pride if ever they come to command others have a sort of revenge mixd with that passion which makes it often very mischievous especially in places where they have no superiours or equals before whom they are obliged to conceal the odious passion hor do you think women have more pride from nature than men     cleo i believe not but they have a great deal more from education hor i dont see the reason for among the better sort the sons especially the eldest have as many ornaments and fine things given them from their infancy to stir up their pride as the daughters cleo but among people equally welleducated the ladies have more flattery bestowd upon them than the gentlemen and it begins sooner hor but why should pride be more encouraged in women than in men cleo for the same reason that it is encouraged in soldiers more than it is in other people to encrease their fear of shame which makes them always mindful of their honour hor but to keep both to their respective duties why must a lady have more pride than a gentleman     cleo because the lady is in the greatest danger of straying from it she has a passion within that may begin to affect her at twelve or thirteen and perhaps sooner and she has all the temptations of the men to withstand besides she has all the artillery of our sex to fear a seducer of uncommon address and resistless charms may court her to what nature prompts and sollicites her to do he may add great promises actual bribes this may be done in the dark and when no body is by to dissuade her gentlemen very seldom have occasion to shew their courage before they are sixa or seventeen years of age and rarely so soon they are not put to the tryal till by conversing with men of honour they are confirmd in their pride in the affair of a quarrel they have their friends to consult and these are so many witnesses of their behaviour that awe them to their duty and in a manner oblige them to obey the laws of honour all these things conspire to encrease their fear of shame and if they can but render that     superiour to the fear of death their business is done they have no pleasure to expect from breaking the rules of honour nor any crafty tempter that sollicites them to be cowards that pride which is the cause of honour in men only regards their courage and if they can but appear to be brave and will but follow the fashionable rules of    manly honour they may indulge all other appetites and brag of incontinence without reproach the pride likewise that produces honour in women has no other object than their chastity and whilst they keep that jewel entire they can apprehend no shame tenderness and delicacy are a compliment to them and there is no fear of danger so ridiculous but they may own it with ostentation but notwithstanding the weakness of their frame and the softness in which women are generally educated if overcome by chance they have sinnd in private what real hazards will they not run what torments will they not stifle and what crimes will they not commit to hide from the world that frailty which they were taught to be most ashamed of hor it is certain that we seldom hear of publick prostitutes and such as have lost their shame that they murder their infants tho they are otherwise the most abandond wretches i took notice of this in the fable of the bees  and it is very remarkable cleo it contains a plain demonstration that the same passion may produce either a palpable good or a palpable evil in the same person according as selflove and his present circumstances shall direct and that the same fear of shame that makes men sometimes appear so highly virtuous may at others oblige them to commit the most heinous crimes    that therefore honour is not founded upon any principle either of real virtue or true religion must be obvious to all that will but mind what sort of people they are     that are the greatest votaries of that idol and the different duties it requires in the two sexes in the first place the worshippers of honour are the vain and voluptuous the strict observers of modes and fashions that take delight in pomp and luxury and enjoy as much of the world as they are able in the second the word itself i mean the sense of it is so whimsical and there is such a prodigious difference in the signification of it according as the attribute is differently applied either to a man or to a woman that neither of them shall forfeit their honour tho each should be guilty and openly boast of what would be the others greatest shame hor i am sorry that i cannot charge you with injustice but it is very strange that to encourage and industriously encrease pride in a refined education should be the most proper means to make men sollicitous in concealing the outward appearances of it cleo yet nothing is more true but where pride is so much indulged and yet to be so carefully kept from all human view as it is in persons of honour of both sexes it would be impossible for mortal strength to endure the restraint if men could not be taught to play the passion against itself and were not    allowd to change the natural homebred symptoms of it for artificial foreign ones hor by playing the passion against itself i know you mean placing a secret pride in concealing the barefacd signs of it but i dont rightly understand what you mean by changing the symptoms of it cleo when a man exults in his pride and gives a loose to that passion the marks of it are as visible in his countenance his mien his gate and behaviour as they are in a prancing horse or a strutting turkeycock these are all very odious every one feeling the same principle within which is the cause of those symptoms and man being endued with speech all     the open expressions the same passion can suggest to him must for the same reason be equally displeasing these therefore have in all societies been strictly prohibited by common consent in the very infancy of good manners and men have been taught in the room of them to substitute other symptoms equally evident with the first but less offensive and more beneficial to others hor which are they cleo fine cloaths and other ornaments about them the cleanliness observed about their persons the submission that is required of servants costly equipages furniture buildings titles of honour and every thing that men can acquire to make themselves esteemd   0by others without discovering any of the symptoms that are forbid upon a satiety of enjoying these they are allowd likewise to have the vapours and be whimsical tho otherwise they are known to be in health and of good sense hor but since the pride of others is displeasing to us in every shape and these latter symptoms you say are equally evident with the first what is got by the change cleo a great deal when pride is designedly expressd in looks and gestures either in a wild or tame man it is known by all human creatures that see it it is the same when vented in words by every body that understands the language they are spoken in these are marks and tokens that are all the world over the same no body shews them but to have them seen and understood and few persons ever display them without designing that offence to others which they never fail to give whereas the other symptoms may be denied to be what they are and many pretences that they are derivd from other motives may be made for them which the same good manners teach us never to refute nor easily to disbelieve in the very excuses that are made for them there is a condescension that satisfies and pleases us     in those that are altogether destitute of the opportunities to display the symptoms of pride that are allowd of the least portion of that passion is a trou   blesome tho often an unknown guest for in them it is easily turnd into envy and malice and on the least provocation it sallies out in those disguises and is often the cause of cruelty and there never was a mischief committed by mobs or multitudes which this passion had not a hand in whereas the more room men have to vent and gratify the passion in the warrantable ways the more easy it is for them to stifle the odious part of pride and seem to be wholly free from it hor i see very well that real virtue requires a conquest over untaught nature and that the christian religion demands a still stricter selfdenial it likewise is evident that to make ourselves acceptable to an omniscient power nothing is more necessary than sincerity and that the heart should be pure but setting aside sacred matters and a future state dont you think that this complaisance and easy construction of one anothers actions do a great deal of good upon earth and dont you believe that good manners and politeness make men more happy and their lives more comfortable in this world than any thing else could make them without those arts cleo if you will set aside what ought to employ our first care and be our greatest concern and men will have no value for that felicity and peace of mind which can only arise from a consciousness of being good    it is certaina that in a great nation and among a flourishing people whose highest wishes seem to be ease and luxury the upper part could not without those arts enjoy so much of the world as that can afford and that none stand more in need of them than the voluptuous men of parts that will joyn worldly prudence to sensuality and make it their chief study to refine upon pleasure     hor when i had the honour of your company at my house you said that no body knew when or where nor in what kings or emperors reign the laws of honour were enacted pray can you inform me when or which way what we call good manners or politeness came into the world what moralist or politician was it that could teach men to be proud of hiding their pride cleo the restless industry of man to supply his wants and his constant endeavours to meliorate his condition upon earth have produced and brought to perfection many useful arts and sciences of which the beginnings are of uncertain æras and to which we can assign no other causes than human sagacity in general and the joynt labour of many ages in which men have always employd themselves in studying and contriving ways and means to sooth their various appetites and make the best of their    infirmities whence had we the first rudiments of architecture how came sculpture and painting to be what they have been these many hundred years and who taught every nation the respective languages they speak now when i have a mind to dive into the origin of any maxim or political invention for the use of society in general i dont trouble my head with enquiring after the time or country in which it was first heard of nor what others have wrote or said about it but i go directly to the fountain head human nature itself and look for the frailty or defect in man that is remedyd or supplyda by that invention when things are very obscure i sometimes make use of conjectures to find my way hor do you argue or pretend to prove any thing from those conjectures cleo no i never reason but from the plain observations which every body may make on man the phænomena that appear in the lesser world hor you have without doubt thought on this     subject before now would you communicate to me some of your guesses cleo with abundance of pleasure hor youll give me leave now and then when things are not clear to me to put in a word for informations sake cleo i desire you would you will oblige me with it that selflove was given to all    animals at least the most perfect for selfpreservation is not disputed but as no creature can love what it dislikes it is necessary moreover that every one should have a real liking to its own being superior to what they have to any other i am of opinion begging pardon for the novelty that if this liking was not always permanent the love which all creatures have for themselves could not be so unalterable as we see it is hor what reason have you to suppose this liking which creatures have for themselves to be distinct from selflove since the one plainly comprehends the other    0 cleo i will endeavour to explain myself better i fancy that to encrease the care in creatures to preserve themselves nature has given them an instinct by which every individual values itself above its real worth this in us i mean in man seems to be accompanyd with a diffidence arising from a consciousness or at least an apprehension that we do overvalue ourselves it is this that makes us so fond of the approbation liking and assent of others because they strengthen and confirm us in the good opinion we have of ourselves the reasons why this selfliking give me leave to call it so is not plainly to be seen in all animals that are of the same degree of perfection are many some want ornaments and consequently the means to express it others are too stupid    and listless it is to be considerd likewise that creatures which are always in the same circumstances and meet with little variation in their way of living have neither opportunity nor temptation to shew it that the more mettle and liveliness creatures have the more visible this liking is and that in those of the same kind the greater spirit they are of and the more they excel in the perfections of     their species the fonder they are of shewing it in most birds it is evident especially in those that have extraordinary finery to display in a horse it is more conspicuous than in any other irrational creature it is most apparent in the swiftest the strongest the most healthy and vigorous and may be encreasd in that animal by additional ornaments and the presence of man whom he knows to clean take care of and delight in him it is not improbable that this great liking which creatures have for their own individuals is the principle on which the love to their species is built cows and sheep too dull and livelessa to make any demonstration of this liking yet herd and feed together each with his own species because no others are so like themselves by this they seem to know likewise that they have the same interest and the same enemies cows have often been seen to joyn in a common defence against wolves birds of a feather flock together and i dare say that    the screech owl likes her own note better than that of the nightingale hor montain seems to have been somewhat of your opinion when he fancyd that if brutes were to paint the deity they would all draw him of their own species  but what you call selfliking is evidently pride cleo i believe it is or at least the cause of it  i believe moreover that many creatures shew this liking when for want of understanding them we     dont perceive it when a cat washes her face and a dog licks himself clean they adorn themselves as much as it is in their power man himself in a savage state feeding on nuts and acorns and destitute of all outward ornaments would have infinitely less temptation as well as opportunity of shewing this liking of himself than he has when civilizd yet if a hundred males of the first all equally free were together within less than half an hour this liking in question though their bellies were full would appear in the desire of superiority that would be shewn among them and the most vigorous either in strength or understanding or both would be the first that would display it if as supposd they were all untaught this would breed contention and there would certainly be war before there could be any agreement among them unless one of them had some one    or more visible excellencies above the rest i said males and their bellies full because if they had women among them or wanted food their quarrel might begin on another account hor this is thinking abstractly indeed but do you think that two or three hundred single savages men and women that never had been under any subjection and were above twenty years of age could ever establish a society and be united into one body if without being acquainted with one another they should meet by chance cleo no more i believe than so many horses but societies never were made that way it is possible that several families of savages might unite and the heads of them agree upon some sort of government or other for their common good but among them it is certain likewise that though superiority was     tollerably well settled and every male had females enough strength and prowess in this uncivilizd state would be infinitely more valued than understanding i mean in the men for the women will always prize themselves for what they see the men admire in them hence it would follow that the women would value themselves and envy one another for being handsome and that the ugly and deformd and all those that were least favourd by nature would be the first that would fly to art and additio   nal ornaments seeing that this made them more agreeable to the men it would soon be followd by the rest and in a little time they would strive to outdo one another as much as their circumstances would allow of and it is possible that a woman with a very handsome nose might envy her neighbour with a much worse for having a ring thro it hor you take great delight in dwelling on the behaviour of savages what relation has this to politeness cleo the seeds of it are lodgd in this selflove and selfliking which i have spoke of as will soon appear if we consider what would be the consequence of them in the affair of selfpreservation and a creature endued with understanding speech and risibility selflove would first make it scrape together every thing it wanted for sustenance provide against the injuries of the air and do every thing to make itself and young ones secure selfliking would make it seek for opportunities by gestures looks and sounds to display the value it has for itself superiour to what it has for others an untaught man would desire every body that came near him to agree with him in the opinion of his superiour worth and be angry as far as his fear would let him with all that should refuse it he would be highly delighted with and love every body whom he thought to    have a good opinion of him especially those that by     words or gestures should own it to his face whenever he met with any visible marks in others of inferiority to himself he would laugh  and do the same at their misfortunes as far as his own pity would give him leave and he would insult every body that would let him hor this selfliking you say was given to creatures for selfpreservation i should think rather that it is hurtful to men because it must make them odious to one another and i cannot see what benefit they can receive from it either in a savage or a civilizd state is there any instance of its doing any good cleo i wonder to hear you ask that question have you forgot the many virtues which i have demonstrateda may be counterfeited to gain applause and the good qualities a man of sense in great fortune may acquire by the sole help and instigation of his pride hor i beg your pardon yet what you say only regards man in the society and after he has been perfectly well educated what advantage is it to him as a single creature selflove i can plainly see induces him to labour for his maintenance and safety and makes him fond of every thing which he imagines to tend to his preservation but what good does the selfliking to him   0 cleo if i should tell you that the inward pleasure and satisfaction a man receives from the gratification of that passion is a cordial that contributes to his health you would laugh at me and think it far fetchd hor perhaps not but i would set against it the many sharp vexations and heartbreaking sorrows that men suffer on the score of this passion from disgraces disappointments and other misfortunes     which i believe have sent millions to their graves much sooner than they would have gone if their pride had less affected them cleo i have nothing against what you say but this is no proof that the passion itself was not given to man for selfpreservation and it only lays open to us the precariousness of sublunary happiness and the wretched condition of mortals there is nothing created that is always a blessing the rain and sunshine themselves to which all earthly comforts are owing have been the causes of innumerable calamities all animals of prey and thousand others hunt after food with the hazard of their lives and the greater part of them perish in their pursuits after sustenance plenty itself is not less fatal to some than want is to others and of our own species every opulent nation has had great numbers that in full safety from all other dangers have destroyd themselves by excesses of eating and drinking yet nothing is more    certain than that hunger and thirst were given to creatures to make them sollicitous after and crave those necessaries without which it would be impossible for them to subsist hor still i can see no advantage accruing from this selfliking to man considerd as a single creature which can induce me to believe that nature should have given it us for selfpreservation what you have alledgd is obscure can you name a benefit every individual person receives from that principle within him that is manifest and clearly to be understood cleo since it has been in disgrace and every body disowns the passion it seldom is seen in its proper colours and disguises itself in a thousand different shapes we are often affected with it when we have not the least suspicion of it but it seems to be that which continually furnishes us with that relish we have for life even when it is not worth having whilst men are pleasd selfliking has every moment a considerable share tho unknown in procuring the     satisfaction they enjoy it is so necessary to the wellbeing of those that have been used to indulge it that they can taste no pleasure without it and such is the deference and the submissive veneration they pay to it that they are deaf to the loudest calls of nature and will rebuke the strongest appetites that should pretend to    be gratifyd at the expence of that passion it doubles our happiness in prosperity and buoys us up against the frowns of adverse fortune it is the mother of hopes and the end as well as the foundation of our best wishes it is the strongest armour against despair and as long as we can like any ways our situation either in regard to present circumstances or the prospect before us we take care of ourselves and no man can resolve upon suicide whilst selfliking lasts but as soon as that is over all our hopes are extinct and we can form no wishes but for the dissolution of our frame till at last our being becomes so intollerable to us that selflove prompts us to make an end of it and seek refuge in death hor you mean selfhatred for you have said your self that a creature cannot love what it dislikes cleo if you turn the prospect you are in the right but this only proves to us what i have often hinted at that man is made up of contrarieties otherwise nothing seems to be more certain than that whoever kills himself by choice must do it to avoid something which he dreads more than that death which he chuses therefore how absurd soever a persons reasoning may be there is in all suicide a palpable intention of kindness to ones self     hor i must own that your observations are entertaining i am very well pleasd with your discourse and i see an agreeable glimmering of probability that runs through it but you have said nothing that comes up to a half proof on the side of your conjecture if it be seriously considerd     cleo i told you before that i would lay no stress upon nor draw any conclusions from it but whatever natures design was in bestowing this selfliking on creatures and whether it has been given to other animals besides ourselves or not it is certain that in our own species every individual person likes himself better than he does any other hor it may be so generally speaking but that it is not universally true i can assure you from my own experience for i have often wishd myself to be count theodati whom you knew at rome cleo he was a very fine person indeed and extremely well accomplishd and therefore you wishd to be such another which is all you could mean celia has a very handsome face fine eyes fine teeth but she has red hair and is ill made therefore she wishes for chloes hair and bellindas shape but she would still remain celia hor but i wishd that i might have been that person that very theodati cleo that is impossible      hor what is it impossible to wish it cleo yes to wish it unless you wishd for annihilation at the same time it is that self we wish well to and therefore we cannot wish for any change in ourselves but with a proviso that that τό self that part of us that wishes should still remain for take away that consciousness you had of yourself whilst you was wishing and tell me pray what part of you it is that could be the better for the alteration you wishd for hor i believe you are in the right no man can wish but to enjoy something which no part of that same man could do if he was entirely another cleo that he itself the person wishing must be destroyd before the change could be entire     hor but when shall we come to the origin of politeness cleo we are at it now and we need not look for it any further than in the selfliking which i have demonstrated every individual man to be possessd of do but consider these two things first that from the nature of that passion it must follow that all untaught men will ever be hateful to one another in conversation where neither interest nor superiority are considerd for if of two equals one only values himself more by half than he does the other tho that other should value the first equally with himself they would    both be dissatisfied if their thoughts were known to each other but if both valued themselves more by half than they did each other the difference between them would still be greater and a declaration of their sentiments would render them both insufferable to each other which among uncivilizd men would happen every moment because without a mixture of art and trouble the outward symptoms of that passion are not to be stifled the second thing i would have you consider is the effect which in all human probability this inconveniency arising from selfliking would have upon creatures endued with a great share of understanding that are fond of their ease to the last degree and as industrious to procure it these two things i say do but duely weigh and you shall find that the disturbance and uneasiness that must be caused by selfliking whatever strugglings and unsuccessful tryals to remedy them might precede must necessarily produce at long run what we call good manners and politeness hor i understand you i believe everybody in this undisciplind state being affected with the high value he has for himself and displaying the most natural symptoms which you have describd they would all be offended at the barefacd pride of their neighbours and it is impossible that this should     continue long among rational creatures but the repeated    experience of the uneasiness they received from such behaviour would make some of them reflect on the cause of it which in tract of time would make them find out that their own barefaced pride must be as offensive to others as that of others is to themselves cleo what you say is certainly the philosophical reason of the alterations that are made in the behaviour of men by their being civilizd but all this is done without reflection and men by degrees and great length of time fall as it were into these things spontaneously hor how is that possible when it must cost them trouble and there is a palpable selfdenial to be seen in the restraint they put upon themselves cleo in the pursuit of selfpreservation men discover a restless endeavour to make themselves easy which insensibly teaches them to avoid mischief on all emergencies and when human creaturesa once submit to government and are used to live under the restraint of laws it is incredible how many useful cautions shifts and stratagems they will learn to practise by experience and imitation from conversing together without being aware of the natural causes that oblige them to act as they do viz the passions within that unknown to themselves govern their will and direct their behaviour     hor youll make men as mere machines as cartes does brutes cleo i have no such design  but i am of opinion   0 that men find out the use of their limbs by instinct as much as brutes do the use of theirs and that without knowing any thing of geometry or arithmetick even children may learn to perform actions that seem to bespeak great skill in mechanicks and a considerable depth of thought and ingenuity in the contrivance besides hor what actions are they which you judge this from cleo the advantageous postures which theyll chuse in resisting force in pulling pushing or otherwise removing weight from their slight and dexterity in throwing stones and other projectils and the stupendious cunning made use of in leaping hor what stupendious cunning i pray cleo when men would leap or jump a great way you know they take a run before they throw themselves off the ground it is certain that by this means they jump further and with greater force than they could do otherwise the reason likewise is very plain the body partakes of and is moved by two motions and the velocity imprest upon it by leaping must be added to so much as it retained of the velocity it was put into by running whereas the body of a person who takes his leap as he is standing    still has no other motion than what is     receivd from the muscular strength exerted in the act of leaping see a thousand boys as well as men jump and theyll all make use of this stratagem but you wont find one of them that does it knowingly for that reason what i have said of this stratagem made use of in leaping i desire you would apply to the doctrine of good manners which is taught and practised by millions who never thought on the origin of politeness or so much as knew the real benefit it is of to society the most crafty and designing will every where be the first that for interestsake will learn to conceal this passion of pride and in a little time no body will shew the least symptom of it whilst he is asking favours or stands in need of help hor that rational creatures should do all this without thinking or knowing what they were about is inconceivable bodily motion is one thing and the exercise of the understanding is another and therefore agreeable postures a graceful mein an easy carriage and a genteel outward behaviour in general may be learnd and contracted perhaps without much thought but good manners are to be observd every where in speaking writing and ordering actions to be performd by others cleo to men who never turnd their thoughts that way it certainly is almost in   conceivable to what prodigious height from next to nothing some arts may be and have been raised by human industry and application by the uninterrupted labour and joint experience of many ages tho none but men of ordinary capacity should ever be employd in them what a noble as well as beautiful what a glorious machine is a firstrate man of war when she is under sail well riggd and well mannd as in bulk and weight it is vastly superior to any other moveable body of human invention so there is no other that has an equal variety of differently surprizing     contrivances to boast of there are many sets of hands in the nation that not wanting proper materials would be able in less than half a year to produce fit out and navigate a firstrate yet it is certain that this task would be impracticable if it was not divided and subdivided into a great variety of different labours  and it is as certain that none of these labours require any other than working men of ordinary capacities hor what would you infer from this cleo that we often ascribe to the excellency of mans genius and the depth of his penetration what is in reality owing to length of time and the experience of many generations all of them very little differing from one another in natural parts and sagacity and to know what it must have cost to bring that art of making ships  for   0different purposes     to the perfection in which it is now we are only to consider in the first place that many considerable improvements have been made in it within these fifty years and less and in the second that the inhabitants of this island did build and make use of ships eighteen hundred years ago and that from that time to this they have never been without hor which all together make a strong proof of the slow progress that art has made to be what it is cleo the chevalier reneau has wrote a book in which he shews the mechanism of sailing and accounts mathematically for every thing that belongs to the working and steering of a ship  i am persuaded that neither the first inventors of ships and sailing or those who have made improvements since in any part of them ever dreamd of those reasons any more than now the rudest and most illiterate of the vulgar do when they are made sailors which time and practice will do in spight of their teeth we have thousands of them that were first hauld on board and detaind against their wills and yet in less than three years time knew every rope and every pully in the ship and without the least scrap of mathematicks had learnd the management as well as use of them much better than the greatest mathematician could have done in all his lifetime if he had ne   ver been at sea the book i mentiond among other curious things demonstrates what angle the rudder must make with the keel to render its influence upon the ship the most powerful this has its merit but a lad of fifteen who has servd a year of his time on board of a hoy knows every thing that is useful in this demonstration practically seeing the poop always answering the motion of the helm he only minds the latter without making the least reflection     on the rudder till in a year or two more his knowledge in sailing and capacity of steering his vessel become so habitual to him that he guides her as he does his own body by instinct tho he is half asleep or thinking on quite another thing hor if as you said and which i now believe to be true the people who first invented and afterwards improved upon ships and sailing never dreamd of those reasons of monsieur reneau it is impossible that they should have acted from them as motives that induced them a priori to put their inventions and improvements in practice with knowledge and design which i suppose is what you intended to prove cleo it is and i verily believe not only that the raw beginners who made the first essays in either art good manners as well as sailing were ignorant of the true cause the real foundation those arts are built upon in    nature but likewise that even now both arts are brought to great perfection the greatest part of those that are most expert and daily making improvements in them know as little of the rationale of them as their predecessors did at first tho i believe at the same time monsieur reneaus reasons to be very just and yours as good as his that is i believe that there is as much truth and solidity in your accounting for the origin of good manners as there is in his for the management of ships they are very seldom the same sort of people those that invent arts and improvements in them and those that enquire into the reason of things this latter is most commonly practisd by such as are idle and indolent that are fond of retirement hate business and take delight in speculation whereas none succeed oftener in the first than active stirring and laborious men such as will put their hand to the plough try experiments and give all their attention to what they are about hor it is commonly imagind that speculative men are best at invention of all sorts cleo yet it is a mistake soapboyling graindying     and other trades and mysteries are from mean beginnings brought to great perfection but the many improvements that can be remembred to have been made in them have for the generality been owing to persons who either were brought up to or    had long practisd and been conversant in those trades and not to great proficients in chymistry or other parts of philosophy whom one would naturally expect those things from in some of these arts especially grain or scarletdying there are processes really astonishing and by the mixture of various ingredients by fire and fermentation several operations are performd which the most sagacious naturalist cannot account for by any system yet known a certain sign that they were not invented by reasoning a priori when once the generality begin to conceal the high value they have for themselves men must become more tolerable to one another now new improvements must be made every day till some of them grow impudent enough not only to deny the high value they have for themselves but likewise to pretend that they have greater value for others than they have for themselves  this will bring in complaisance and now flattery will rush in upon them like a torrent as soon as they are arrived at this pitch of insincerity they will find the benefit of it and teach it their children the passion of shame is so general and so early discoverd in all human creatures that no nation can be so stupid as to be long without observing and making use of it accordingly the same may be said of the credulity of infants which is very inviting to many good purposes the knowledge of    parents is communicated to their offspring and every ones experience in life being added to what he learnd in his youth every generation after this must be better taught than the     preceding by which means in two or three centuries good manners must be brought to great perfection hor when they are thus far advanced it is easy to conceive the rest for improvements i suppose are made in good manners as they are in all other arts and sciences but to commence from savages men i believe would make but a small progress in good manners the first three hundred years the romans who had a much better beginning had been a nation above six centuries and were almost masters of the world before they could be said to be a polite people what i am most astonishd at and which i am now convincd of is that the basis of all this machinery is pride another thing i wonder at is that you chose to speak of a nation that enterd upon good manners before they had any notions of virtue or religion which i believe there never was in the world cleo pardon me horatio i have no where insinuated that they had none but i had no reason to mention them in the first place you askd my opinion concerning the use of politeness in this world abstract from the considerations of a future state secondly    the art of good manners has nothing to do with virtue or religion tho it seldom clashes with either it is a science that is ever built on the same steady principle in our nature whatever the age or the climate may be in which it is practisd hor how can any thing be said not to clash with virtue or religion that has nothing to do with either and consequently disclaims both cleo this i confess seems to be a paradox yet it is true the doctrine of good manners teaches men to speak well of all virtues but requires no more of them in any age or country than the outward appearance of those in fashion and as to sacred matters it is every where satisfied with aa seeming conformity in outward worship for all the religions     in the universe are equally agreeable to good manners where they are national and pray what opinion must we say a teacher to be of to whom all opinions are probable alike all the precepts of good manners throughout the world have the same tendency and are no more than the various methods of making ourselves acceptable to others with as little prejudice to ourselves as is possible by which artifice we assist one another in the enjoyments of life and refining upon pleasure and every individual person is rendered more happy by it in the fruition of all the good things he can purchase than he    could have been without such behaviour i mean happy in the sense of the voluptuous let us look back on old greece the roman empire or the great eastern nations that flourishd before them and we shall find that luxury and politeness ever grew up together and were never enjoyd asunder that comfort and delight upon earth have always employd the wishes of the beau monde and that as their chief study and greatest sollicitude to outward appearance have ever been directed to obtain happiness in this world so what would become of them in the next seems to the naked eye always to have been the least of their concern hor i thank you for your lecture you have satisfied me in several things which i had intended to ask but you have said some others that i must have time to consider after which i am resolved to wait upon you again for i begin to believe that concerning the knowledge of ourselves most books are either very defective or very deceitful cleo there is not a more copious nor a more faithful volume than human nature to those who will diligently peruse it and i sincerely believe that i have discoverd nothing to you which if you had thought of it with attention you would not have found out yourself but i shall never be better pleasd with myself than when i can contribute to any entertainment you shall think diverting     the fourth dialogue    the fourth dialogue between horatio and cleomenes cleomenes your servant hor what say you now cleomenes isa not this without ceremony cleo you are very obliging hor when they told me where you was i would suffer no body to tell you who it was that wanted you or to come up with me cleo this is friendly indeed hor you see what a proficient i am in a little time youll teach me to lay aside all good manners cleo you make a fine tutor of me hor youll pardon me i know this study of yours is a very pretty place     cleo i like it because the sun never enters it hor a very pretty room cleo shall we sit down in it it is the coolest room in the house     hor with all my heart cleo i was in hopes to have seen you before now you have taken a long time to consider hor just eight days cleo have you thought on the novelty i started hor i have and think it not void of probability for that there are no innate ideas  and men come into the world without any knowledge at all i am convincd of and therefore it is evident to me that all arts and sciences must once have had a beginning in some bodys brain whatever oblivion that may now be lost in i have thought twenty times since i saw you last on the origin of good manners and what a pleasant scene it would be to a man who is tolerably well versed in the world to see among a rude nation those first essays they made of concealing their pride from one another cleo you see by this that it is chiefly the novelty of things that strikes as well in begetting our aversion as in gaining our approbation and that we may look upon many indifferently when they come to be fami   liar to us tho they were shocking when they were new you are now diverting yourself with a truth which eight days ago you would have given an hundred guineas not to have known hor i begin to believe there is nothing so absurd that it would appear to us to be such if we had been accustomd to it very young cleo in a tolerable education we are so industriously and so assiduously instructed from our most early infancy in the ceremonies of bowing and pulling off hats and other rules of behaviour that even before we are men we hardly look upon a mannerly deportment as a thing acquired or think conversation to   0 be a science thousand things are calld easy and natural in postures and motions as well as speaking and writing that have causd infinite pains to others as well as ourselves and which we know to be the product of art what aukward lumps have i known which the dancingmaster has put limbs to hor yesterday morning as i sate musing by myself an expression of yours which i did not so much reflect upon at first when i heard it came in to my head and made me smile speaking of the rudiments of good manners in an infant nation when they once enterd upon concealing their pride you said that improvements would be made every day till some of them grew impudent enough not only to deny the high value they had for them  0selves but likewise to pretend that they had greater value for others than they had for themselves  cleo it is certain that this every where must have been the forerunner of flattery hor when you talk of flattery and impudence what do you think of the first man that had the face to tell his equal that he was his humble servant cleo if that had been a new compliment i should have wonderd much more at the simplicity of the proud man that swallowd than i would have done at the impudence of the knave that made it hor it certainly once was new which pray do you believe more antient pulling off the hat or saying your humble servant cleo they are both of them gothick and modern hor i believe pulling off the hat was first it being the emblem of liberty cleo i dont think so for he who pulld off his hat the first time could not have been understood if saying your servant had not been practisd and to shew respect a man as well might have pulld off one of his shoes as his hat if saying your servant     had not been an establishd and wellknown compliment hor so he might as you say and had a better authority for the first than he could have for the latter     cleo and to this day taking off the hat is a dumb shew of a known civility in words mind now the power of custom and imbibed notions we both laugh at this gothick absurdity and are well assured that it must have had its origin from the basest flattery yet neither of us walking with our hats on could meet an acquaintance with whom we are not very familiar without shewing this piece of civility nay it would be a pain to us not to do it but we have no reason to think that the compliment of saying your servant began among equals but rather that flatterers having given it to princes it grew afterwards more common for all those postures and flexions of body and limbs had in all probability their rise from the adulation that was paid to conquerors and tyrants who having every body to fear were always alarmd at the least shadow of opposition and never better pleasd than with submissive and defenceless postures and you see that they have all a tendency that way they promise security and are silent endeavours to ease and rid them not only of their fears but likewise every suspicion of harm approaching them such as lying prostrate on our faces touching the ground with our heads kneeling bowing low laying our hands upon our breasts or holding them behind us folding our arms together and all the cringes that can be made to demonstrate    that we neither indulge our ease nor stand upon our guard these are evident signs and convincing proofs to a superior that we have a mean opinion of ourselves in respect to him that we are at his mercy and have no thought to resist much less to attack him and therefore it is highly probable that saying     your servant and pulling off the hat were at first demonstrations of obedience to those that claimd it hor which in tract of time became more familiar and were made use of reciprocally in the way of civility cleo i believe so for as good manners encrease we see that the highest compliments are made common and new ones to superiorsa invented instead of them hor so the word grace which not long ago was a title that none but our kings and queens were honoured with is devolved upon archbishops and dukes cleo it was the same with highness which is now given to the children and even the grandchildren of kings hor the dignity that is annexd to the signification of the word lord has been better preservd with us than in most countries in spanish italian high and lowdutch it is prostituted to almost every body cleo it has had better fate in france where likewise the word sire has lost nothing of its majesty and is only used to the monarch    whereas with us it is a compliment of address that may be made to a cobler as well as to a king hor whatever alterations may be made in the sense of words by time yet as the world grows more polishd flattery becomes less barefaced and the design of it upon mans pride is better disguisd than it was formerly to praise a man to his face was very common among the ancients considering humility to be a virtue particularly required of christians i have often wonderd how the fathers of the church could suffer those acclamations and applauses that were made to them whilst they were preaching and which tho some of them spoke against them many of them appear to have been extremely fond of     cleo human nature is always the same where men exert themselves to the utmost and take uncommon pains that spend and waste the spirits those applauses are very reviving the fathers who spoke against them spoke chiefly against the abuse of them hor it must have been very odd to hear people bawling out as often the greatest part of an audience did sophos divinitus non potest melius mirabiliter acriter ingeniose they told the preachers likewise that they were orthodox and sometimes calld them apostolus decimus tertius     cleo these words at the end of a period might have passd but the repetitions of them were often so loud and so general and the noise they made with their hands and feet so disturbing in and out of season that they could not hear a quarter of the sermon yet several fathers ownd that it was highly delightful and soothing human frailty hor the behaviour at churches is more decent as it is now cleo since paganism has been quite extinct in the old western world the zeal of christians is much diminishd from what it was when they had many opposers  the want of fervency had a great hand in abolishing that fashion hor but whether it was the fashion or not it must always have been shocking cleo do you think that the repeated acclamations the clapping stamping and the most extravagant tokens of applause that are now used at our several theatres were ever shocking to a favorite actor or that the huzzahs of the mob or the hideous shouts of soldiers were ever shocking to persons of the highest distinction to whose honour they were made hor i have known princes that were very much tired with them     cleo when they had too much of them but never at first in working a machine we ought to have regard to the strength of its    frame limited creatures are not susceptible of infinite delight therefore we see that a pleasure protracted beyond its due bounds becomes a pain but where the custom of the country is not broken in upon no noise that is palpably made in our praise and which we may hear with decency can ever be ungrateful if it dont outlast a reasonable time but there is no cordial so sovereign that it may not become offensive by being taken to excess hor and the sweeter and more delicious liquors are the sooner they become fulsom and the less fit they are to sit by cleo your simile is not amiss and the same acclamations that are ravishing to a man at first and perhaps continue to give him an unspeakable delight for eight or nine minutes may become more moderately pleasing indifferent cloying troublesome and even so offensive as to create pain all in less than three hours if they were to continue so long without intermission hor there must be great witchcraft in sounds that they should have such different effects upon us as we often see they have cleo the pleasure we receive from acclamations is not in the hearing but proceeds from the opinion we form of the cause that produces those sounds the approbation of others at the theatres all over italy you have heard that when the whole audience    demands silence and attention which there is an establishd mark of benevolence and applause the noise they make comes very near and is hardly to be distinguishd from our hissing which with us is the plainest token of dislike and contempt and without doubt the catcalls to affront faustina were far more agreeable to cozzoni than the     most artful sounds she ever heard from her triumphant rival  hor that was abominable cleo the turks shew their respects to their sovereigns by a profound silence which is strictly kept throughout the seraglio and still more religiously observed the nearer you come to the sultans apartment hor this latter is certainly the politer way of gratifying ones pride cleo all that depends upon mode and custom hor but the offerings that are made to a mans pride in silence may be enjoyd without the loss of his hearing which the other cannot cleo that is a trifle in the gratification of that passion we never enjoy higher pleasure from the appetite we would indulge than when we feel nothing from any other hor but silence expresses greater homage and deeper veneration than noise cleo it is good to sooth the pride of a drone but an active man loves to have that    passion rousd and as it were kept awake whilst it is gratifyd and approbation from noise is more unquestionable than the other however i wont determine between     them much may be said on both sides the greeks and romans used sounds to stir up men to noble actions with great success and the silence observed among the ottomans has kept them very well in the slavish submission which their sovereigns require of them perhaps the one does better where absolute power is lodgd in one person and the other where there is some shew of liberty both are proper tools to flatter the pride of man when they are understood and made use of as such i have known a very brave man used to the shouts of war and highly delighted with loud applause be very angry with his butler for making a little ratling with his plates hor an old aunt of mine th other day turnd away a very clever fellow for not walking upon his toes and i must own myself that the stamping of footmen and all unmannerly loudness of servants are very offensive to me tho i never enterd into the reason of it before now in our last conversation when you describd the symptoms of selfliking and what the behaviour would be of an uncivilizd man you named laughing i know it is one of the characteristicks of our species pray do you take that to be likewise the result of pride     cleo hobbes is of that opinion  and in most     instances it might be derived from thence but there are some phænomenaa not to be explaind by that hypothesis therefore i would chuse to say that laughter is a mechanical motion which we are naturally thrown into when we are unaccountably pleasd when our pride is feelingly gratifyd when we hear or see any thing which we admire or approve of or when we are indulging any other passion or appetite and the reason why we are pleasd seems to be just and worthy we are then far from laughing but when things or actions are odd and out of the way and happen to please us when we can give no just reason why they should do so it is then generally speaking that they make us laugh hor i would rather side with what you said was hobbess opinion for the things we commonly laugh at are such as are some way or other mortifying unbecoming or prejudicial to others cleo but what will you say to tickling which will make an infant laugh that is deaf and blind hor can you account for that by your system cleo not to my satisfaction but ill tell you what might be said for it we know by experience that the smoother the softer and the more sensible the skin is the more ticklish persons are generally speaking we know    likewise that things rough sharp and hard when they touch the skin are displeasing to us even before they give pain and that on the contrary every thing applyd to the skin that     is soft and smooth and not otherwise offensive is delightful it is possible that gentle touches being impressd on several nervous filaments at once every one of them producing a pleasing sensation may create that confusd pleasure which is the occasion of laughter hor but how come you to think of mechanick motion in the pleasure of a free agent cleo whatever free agency we may pretend to in the forming of ideas the effect of them upon the body is independent of the will nothing is more directly opposite to laughing than frowning the one draws wrinkles in the forehead knits the brows and keeps the mouth shut the other does quite the reverse exporrigere frontem  you know is a latin phrase for being merry in sighing the muscles of the belly and breast are pulld inward and the diaphragm is pulld upward more than ordinary and we seem to endeavour tho in vain to squeeze and compress the heart whilst we draw in our breath in a forcible manner and when in that squeezing posture we have taken in as much air as we can contain we throw it out with the same violence we suckd it in with and at   0the same time give a sudden relaxation to all the muscles we employd before nature certainly designd this for something in the labour for selfpreservation which she forces upon us how mechanically do all creatures that can make any sound cry out and complain in great afflictions as well as pain and imminent danger in great torments the efforts of nature are so violent that way that to disappoint her and prevent the discovery of what we feel by sounds and which she bids us make we are forcd to draw our mouth into a purse or else suck in our breath bite our lips or squeeze them     close together and use the most effectual means to hinder the air from coming out in grief we sigh in mirth we laugh in the latter little stress is laid upon the respiration and this is performd with less regularity than it is at any other time all the muscles without and every thing within feel loose and seem to have no other motion than what is communicated to them by the convulsive shakes of laughter hor i have seen people laugh till they lost all their strength cleo how much is all this the reverse of what we observe in sighing when pain or depth of woe make us cry out the mouth is drawn round or at least into an oval the lips are thrusted forward without touching each other and the tongue is pulld in which is the reason that all nations when they exclaim cry oh     hor why pray cleo because whilst the mouth lips and tongue remain in those postures they can sound no other vowel and no consonant at all in laughing the lips are pulld back and straind to draw the mouth in its fullest length hor i would not have you lay great stress upon that for it is the same in weeping which is an undoubted sign of sorrow cleo in great afflictions where the heart is oppressd and anxieties which we endeavour to resist few people can weep but when they do it removes the oppression and sensibly relieves them for then their resistance is gone and weeping in distress is not so much a sign of sorrow as it is an indication that we can bear our sorrow no longer and therefore it is counted unmanly to weep because it seems to give up our strength and is a kind of yielding to our grief but the action of weeping itself is not more peculiar to grief than it is to joy   0 in adult people and there are men who shew great fortitude in afflictions and bear the greatest misfortunes with dry eyes that will cry heartily at a moving scene in a play some are easily wrought upon by one thing others are sooner affected with another but whatever touches us so forcibly as to overwhelm the mind prompts us to weep and is the mechanical cause of tears and therefore be   sides grief joy and pity there are other things no way relating to ourselves that may have this effect upon us such as the relations of surprizing events and sudden turns of providence in behalf of merit instances of heroism of generosity in love in friendship in an enemy or the hearing or reading of noble thoughts and sentiments of humanity more especially if these things are conveyd to us suddenly in an agreeable manner and unlookd for as well as lively expressions we shall observe likewise that none are more subject to this frailty of shedding tears on such foreign accounts than persons of ingenuity and quick apprehension and those among them that are most benevolent generous and openhearted whereas the dull and stupid the cruel selfish and designing are very seldom troubled with it weeping therefore in earnest is always a sure and involuntary demonstration that something strikes and overcomes the mind whatever that be which affects it we find likewise that outward violence as sharp winds and smoak the effluvia of onions and other volatile salts c have the same effect upon the external fibres of the lachrymal ducts and glands that are exposed which the sudden swelling and pressure of the spiritsa has upon those within the divine wisdom is in nothing more conspicuous than in the infinite variety of living creatures of different constructi   on every part of them being contrivd with stupendious skill and fitted     with the utmost accuracy for the different purposes they were designd for the human body above all is a most astonishing masterpiece of art the anatomist may have a perfect knowledge of all the bones and their ligaments the muscles and their tendons and be able to dissect every nerve and every membrane with great exactness the naturalist likewise may dive a great way into the inward oeconomy and different symptoms of health and sickness they may all approve of and admire the curious machine but no man can have a tolerable idea of the contrivance the art and the beauty of the workmanship itself even in those things he can see without being likewise versd in geometry and mechanicks hor how long is it ago that mathematicks were brought into physick that art i have heard is brought to great certainty by them cleo what you speak of is quite another thing mathematicks never had nor ever can have any thing to do with physick if you mean by it the art of curing the sick the structure and motions of the body may perhaps be mechanically accounted for and all fluids are under the laws of hydrostaticks  but we can have no help from any part of the mechanicks in the discovery of    hings infinitely remote from sight and entirely unknown as to their shapes and bulks physicians with the rest of mankind are wholly ignorant of the first principles and     constituent parts of things in which all the virtues and properties of them consist and this as well of the blood and other juices of the body as the simples and consequently all the medicines they make use of there is no art that has less certainty than theirs and the most valuable knowledge in it arises from observation and is such as a man of parts and application who has fitted himself for that study can only be possessd of after a long and judicious experience  but the pretence to mathematicks or the usefulness of it in the cure of diseases is a cheat and as errant a piece of quackery as a stage and a merry andrew hor but since there is so much skill displayd in the bones muscles and grosser parts is it not reasonable to think that there is no less art bestowd on those that are beyond the reach of our senses cleo i no ways doubt it microscopes have opend a new world to us and i am far from thinking that nature should leave off her work where we can trace her no further i am persuaded that our thoughts and the affections of the mind have a more certain and more mechanical influence upon several parts of the body than has been hitherto or in    all human probability ever will be discovered the visible effect they have on the eyes and muscles of the face must shew the least attentive the reason i have for this assertion when in mens company we are upon our guard and would preserve our dignity the lips are shut and the jaws meet the muscles of the mouth are gently braced and the rest all over the face are kept firmly in their places turn away from these into another room where you meet with a fine young lady that is affable and easy immediately before you think on it your countenance will be strangely alterd and without being conscious of having done any thing to your face youll have quite     another look and every body that has observd you will discover in it more sweetness and less severity than you had the moment before when we suffer the lower jaw to sink down the mouth opens a little if in this posture we look strait before us without fixing our eyes on any thing we may imitate the countenance of a natural by dropping as it were our features and laying no stress on any muscle of the face infants before they have learnd to swallow their spittle generally keep their mouths open and are always drivelling in them before they shew any understanding and whilst it is yet very confusd the muscles of the face are as it were relaxd the lower jaw falls down and the fibres of    the lips are unbraced at least these phænomena we observe in them during that time more often than we do afterwards in extreme old age when people begin to doat thesea symptoms return and in most idiots they continue to be observd as long as they live hence it is that we say that a man wants a slabberingbibb when he behaves very sillily or talks like a natural fool when we reflect on all this on the one hand and consider on the other that none are less prone to anger than idiots and no creatures are less affected with pride i would ask whether there is not some degree of selfliking that mechanically influences and seems to assist us in the decent wearing of our faces hor i cannot resolve you what i know very well is that by these conjectures on the mechanism of man i find my understanding very little informd i wonder how we came upon the subject cleo you enquired into the origin of risibility which no body can give an account of with any certainty and in such cases every body is at liberty to make guesses so they draw no conclusions from them to the prejudice of any thing better establishd but the chief design i had in giving you these indigested     thoughts was to hint to you how really mysterious the works of nature are i mean how replete they are every where    with a power glaringly conspicuous and yet incomprehensible beyond all human reach in order to demonstrate that more useful knowledge may be acquired from unwearied observation judicious experience and arguing from facts à posteriori than from the haughty attempts of entring into first causes and reasoning à priori i dont believe there is a man in the world of that sagacity if he was wholly unacquainted with the nature of a springwatch that he would ever find out by dint of penetration the cause of its motion if he was never to see the inside but every middling capacity may be certain by seeing only the outside that its pointing at the hour and keeping to time proceed from the exactness of some curious workmanship thats hid and that the motion of the hands what number of resorts  soever it is communicated by is originally owing to something else that first moves within in the same manner we are sure that as the effects of thought upon the body are palpable several motions are produced by it by contact and consequently mechanically but the parts the instruments which that operation is performd with are so immensely far remote from our senses and the swiftness of the action is so prodigious that it infinitely surpasses our capacity to trace them     hor but is not thinking the business of the soul what has mechanism to do with that cleo the soul whilst in the body cannot be said to think otherwise than an architect is said to build a house where the carpenters bricklayers c do the work which he chalks out and superintends hor which part of the brain do you think the soul to be more immediately lodgd in or do you take it to be diffused through the whole     cleo i know nothing of it more than what i have told you already hor i plainly feel that this operation of thinking is a labour or at least something that is transacting in my head and not in my leg nor my arm what insight or real knowledge have we from anatomy concerning it cleo none at all à priori the most consummate anatomist knows no more of it than a butchers prentice we may admire the curious duplicate of coats  and close embroidery of veins and arteries that environ the brain but when dissecting it we have viewed the several pairs of nerves with their origin and taken notice of some glands of various shapes and sizes which differing from the brain in substance could not but rush in view when these i say have been    taken notice of and distinguishd by different names some of them not very pertinent and less polite the best naturalist must acknowledge that even of these large visible parts there are but few the nerves and bloodvessels excepted at the use of which he can give any tollerable guesses but as to the mysterious structure of the brain itself and the more abstruse oeconomy of it that he knows nothing but that the whole seems to be a medullary substance compactly treasurd up in infinite millions of imperceptible cells that disposd in an unconceivable order are clusterd together in a perplexing variety of folds and windings hell add perhaps that it is reasonable to think this to be the capacious exchequer of human knowledge in which the faithful senses deposite the vast treasure of images constantly as through their organs they receive them that it is the office in which the spirits are separated from the blood and afterwards sublimd and volatilizd into particles hardly corporeal and that the most minute     of these are always either searching for or variously disposing the images retaind and shooting through the infinite meanders of that wonderful substance employ themselves without ceasing in that inexplicable performance the contemplation of which fills the most exalted genius with amazement   0 hor these are very airy conjectures but nothing of all this can be proved the smallness of the parts youll say is the reason but if greater improvements were made in optick glasses and microscopes could be invented that magnifyd objects three or four millions of times more than they do now then certainly those minute particles so immensely remote from the senses you speak of might be observed if that which does the work is corporeal at all cleo that such improvements are impossible is demonstrable but if it was not even then we could have little help from anatomy the brain of an animal cannot be lookd and searchd into whilst it is alive should you take the main spring out of a watch and leave the barrel that containd it standing empty it would be impossible to find out what it had been that made it exert itself whilst it shewd the time we might examine all the wheels and every other part belonging either to the movement or the motion and perhaps find out the use of them in relation to the turning of the hands but the first cause of this labour would remain a mystery for ever hor the main spring in us is the soul which is immaterial and immortal but what is that to other creatures that have a brain like ours and no such immortal substance distinct    from body dont you believe that dogs and horses think cleo i believe they do though in a degree of perfection far inferior to us      hor what is it that superintends thought in them where must we look for it which is the main spring cleo i can answer you no otherwise than life hor what is life cleo every body understands the meaning of the word though perhaps no body knows the principle of life that part which gives motion to all the rest hor where men are certain that the truth of a thing is not to be known they will always differ and endeavour to impose upon one another cleo whilst there are fools and knaves they will but i have not imposd upon you what i said of the labour of the brain i told you was a conjecture which i recommend no farther to you than you shall think it probable you ought to expect no demonstration of a thing that from its nature can admit of none when the breath is gone and the circulation ceasd the inside of an animal is vastly different from what it was whilst the lungs playd and the blood and juices were in full motion through every part of it you have seen those engines that raise water by the help of fire the steam    you know is that which forces it up  it is as impossible to see the volatile particles that perform the labour of the brain when the creature is dead as in the engine it would be to see the steam which yet does all the work when the fire is out and the water cold yet     if this engine was shewn to a man when it was not at work and it was explaind to him which way it raisd the water it would be a strange incredulity or great dullness of apprehension not to believe it if he knew perfectly well that by heat liquids may be rarified into vapour hor but dont you think there is a difference in souls and are they all equally good or equally bad cleo we have some tolerable ideas of matter and motion or at least of what we mean by them and therefore we may form ideas of things corporeal though they are beyond the reach of our senses and we can conceive any portion of matter a thousand times less than our eyes even by the help of the best microscopes are able to see it but the soul is altogether incomprehensible and we can deterinine but little about it that is not reveald to us i believe that the difference of capacities in men depends upon and is entirely owing to the difference there is between them either in the fabrick itself that is the greater or lesser exactness in the composure of their frame or else in the use that    is made of it the brain of a child newly born is charte blanche  and as you have hinted very justly we have no ideas which we are not obliged for to our senses i make no question but that in this rummaging of the spirits through the brain in hunting after joyning separating changing and compounding of ideas with inconceivable swiftness under the superintendency of the soul the action of thinking consists the best thing therefore we can do to infants after the first month besides feeding and keeping them from harm is to make them take in ideas beginning by the two most useful senses the sight and hearing and dispose them to set about this labour of the brain and by     our example encourage them to imitate us in thinking which on their side is very poorly performd at first therefore the more an infant in health is talkd to and jumbld about the better it is for it at least for the first two years and for its attendance in this early education to the wisest matron in the world i would prefer an active young wench whose tongue never stands still that should run about and never cease diverting and playing with it whilst it was awake and where people can afford it two or three of them to relieve one another when they are tired are better than one     hor then you think children reap great benefit from the nonsensical chat of nurses cleo it is of inestimable use to them and teaches them to think as well as speak much sooner and better than with equal aptitude of parts they would do without the business is to make them exert those faculties and keep infants continually employd about them for the time which is lost then is never to be retrievd hor yet we seldom remember any thing of what we saw or heard before we were two years old then what would be lost if children should not hear all that impertinence cleo as iron is to be hammerd whilst it is hot and ductile so children are to be taught when they are young as the flesh and every tube and membrane about them are then tenderer and will yield sooner to slight impressions than afterwards so many of their bones are but cartilages and the brain itself is much softer and in a manner fluid this is the reason that it cannot so well retain the images it receives as it does afterwards when the substance of it comes to be of a better consistence but as the first images are lost so they are continually succeeded by new ones and the brain at first serves as a slate to cypher or a sampler to work upon what infants should chiefly learn is the performance itself the   0 exercise of thinking and to con   tract a habit of disposing and with ease and agility managing the images retaind to the purpose intended which is never attaind better than whilst the matter is yielding and the organs are most flexible and supple so they but exercise themselves in thinking and speaking it is no matter what they think on or what they say that is inoffensive in sprightly infants we soon see by their eyes the efforts they are making to imitate us before they are able and that they try at this exercise of the brain and make essays to think as well as they do to hammer out words we may know from the incoherence of their actions and the strange absurdities they utter but as there are more degrees of thinking well than there are of speaking plain the first is of the greatest consequence hor i wonder you should talk of teaching and lay so great a stress on a thing that comes so naturally to us as thinking no action is performd with greater velocity by every body as quick as thought is a proverb and in less than a moment a stupid peasant may remove his ideas from london to japan as easily as the greatest wit cleo yet there is nothing in which men differ so immensely from one another as they do in the exercise of this faculty the differences between them in height bulk strength and beauty are trifling in comparison to that which i speak of and there is nothing in the    world more valuable or more plainly perceptible in persons than a happy dexterity of thinking two men may have equal knowledge and yet the one shall speak as well offhand as the other can after two hours study hor i take it for granted that no man would study two hours for a speech if he knew how to make it in less and therefore i cant see what reason you have to suppose two such persons to be of equal knowledge     cleo there is a double meaning in the word knowing which you seem not to attend to there is a great difference between knowing a violin when you see it and knowing how to play upon it the knowledge i speak of is of the first sort and if you consider it in that sense you must be of my opinion for no study can fetch any thing out of the brain that is not there suppose you conceive a short epistle in three minutes which another who can make letters and join them together as fast as your self is yet an hour about tho both of you write the same thing it is plain to me that the slow person knows as much as you do at least it does not appear that he knows less he has receivd the same images but he cannot come at them or at least not dispose them in that order so soon as yourself when we see two exercises of equal goodness either in prose or verse if the one is made ex tempore and we are sure of it and the other has cost two days labour    the author of the first is a person of finer natural parts than the other tho their knowledge for ought we know is the same you see then the difference between knowledge as it signifies the treasure of images receivd and knowledge or rather skill to find out those images when we want them and work them readily to our purpose hor when we know a thing and cannot readily think of it or bring it to mind i thought that was the fault of the memory cleo so it may be in part but there are men of prodigious reading that have likewise great memories who judge ill and seldom say any thing a propos or say it when it is too late among the helluones librorum the cormorants of books there are wretched reasoners that have canine appetites and no digestion what numbers of learned fools do we not meet with in large libraries from whose works it is evident that knowledge must have lain in their heads as furniture at an upholders and the treasure of the brain was     a burden to them instead of an ornament all this proceeds from a defect in the faculty of thinking an unskilfulness and want of aptitude in managing to the best advantage the ideas we have receivd we see others on the contrary that have very fine sense and no litterature at all the generality of women are quicker of invention and more ready at repartee than the men    with equal helps of education  and it is surprizing to see what a considerable figure some of them make in conversation when we consider the small opportunities they have had of acquiring knowledge hor but sound judgment is a great rarity among them cleo only for want of practice application and assiduity thinking on abstruse matters is not their province in life and the stations they are commonly placed in find them other employment but there is no labour of the brain which women are not as capable of performing at least as well as the men with the same assistance if they set about and persevere in it sound judgment is no more than the result of that labour he that uses himself to take things to pieces to compare them together to consider them abstractly and impartially that is he who of two propositions he is to examine seems not to care which is true he that lays the whole stress of his mind on every part alike and puts the same thing in all the views it can be seen in he i say that employs himself most often in this exercise is most likely cæteris paribus to acquire what we call a sound judgment the workmanship in the make of women seems to be more elegant and better finishd the features are more delicate the voice is     sweeter the whole outside of them is more curiously wove than they    are in men and the difference in the skin between theirs and ours is the same as there is between fine cloth and coarse there is no reason to imagine that nature should have been more neglectful of them out of sight than she has where we can trace her and not have taken the same care of them in the formation of the brain as to the nicety of the structure and superior accuracy in the fabrick which is so visible in the rest of their frame hor beauty is their attribute as strength is ours cleo how minute soever those particles of the brain are that contain the several images and are assisting in the operation of thinking there must be a difference in the justness the symmetry and exactness of them between one person and another as well as there is in the grosser parts what the women excel us in then is the goodness of the instrument either in the harmony or pliableness of the organs which must be very material in the art of thinking and is the only thing that deserves the name of natural parts since the aptitude i have spoke of depending upon exercise is notoriously acquired hor as the workmanship in the brain is rather more curious in women than it is in men so in sheep and oxen dogs and horses i suppose it is infinitely coarser   0 cleo we have no reason to think otherwise hor but after all that self that part of us that wills and wishes that chuses one thing rather than another must be incorporeal for if it is matter it must either be one single particle which i can almost feel it is not or a combination of many which is more than inconceivable cleo i dont deny what you say and that the principle of thought and action is inexplicable in all creatures i have hinted already but its being incorporeal does not mend the matter as to the difficulty of explaining or conceiving it that there must be     a mutual contact between this principle whatever it is and the body itself is what we are certain of à posteriori and a reciprocal action upon each other between an immaterial substance and matter is as incomprehensible to human capacity as that thought should be the result of matter and motion hor tho many other animals seem to be endued with thought there is no creature we are acquainted with besides man that shews or seems to feel a consciousness of his thinking cleo it is not easy to determine what instincts properties or capacities other creatures are either possessd or destitute of when those qualifications fall not under our senses but it is highly probable that the principal    and most necessary parts of the machine are less elaborate in animals that attain to all the perfection they are capable of in three four five or six years at furthest than they are in a creature that hardly comes to maturity its full growth and strength in five and twenty the consciousness of a man of fifty that he is the same man that did such a thing at twenty and was once the boy that had such and such masters depends wholly upon the memory and can never be traced to the bottom i mean that no man remembers any thing of himself or what was transacted before he was two years old when he was but a novice in the art of thinking and the brain was not yet of a due consistence to retain long the images it receivd but this remembrance how far soever it may reach gives us no greater surety of our selves than we should have of another that had been brought up with us and never above a week or a month out of sight a mother when her son is thirty years old has more reason to know that he is the same whom she brought into the world than himself and such a one who daily minds her son and remembers the alterations of his features from time to time is more certain of him that he was not     changd in the cradle than she can be of herself so that all we can know of this consciousness is that it consists in or is the result of the running and rummaging of the spirits through    all the mazes of the brain and their looking there for facts concerning ourselves he that has lost his memory tho otherwise in perfect health cant think better than a fool and is no more conscious that he is the same he was a year ago than he is of a man whom he has known but a fortnight there are several degrees of losing our memory but he who has entirely lost it becomes ipso facto an idiot hor i am conscious of having been the occasion of our rambling a great way from the subject we were upon but i dont repent of it what you have said of the oeconomy of the brain and the mechanical influence of thought upon the grosser parts is a noble theme for contemplation on the infinite unutterable wisdom with which the various instincts are so visibly planted in all animals to fit them for the respective purposes they were designd for and every appetite is so wonderfully interwove with the very substance of their frame nothing could be more seasonable after you had shewd me the origin of politeness and in the management of selfliking set forth the excellency of our species beyond all other animals so conspicuous in the superlative docility and indefatigable industry by which all multitudes are capable of drawing innumerable benefits as well for the ease and comfort as the welfare and safety of congregate bodies from a most stub   born and an unconquerable passion which in its nature seems to be destructive to sociableness and society and never fails in untaught men to render them insufferable to one another cleo by the same method of reasoning from facts à posteriori that has laid open to us the nature and usefulness of selfliking all the rest of the passions     may easily be accounted for and become intelligible it is evident that the necessaries of life stand not every where ready dishd up before all creatures therefore they have instincts that prompt them to look out for those necessaries and teach them how to come at them the zeal and alacrity to gratify their appetites is always proportiond to the strength and the degree of force with which those instincts work upon every creature but considering the disposition of things upon earth and the multiplicity of animals that have all their own wants to supply it must be obvious that these attempts of creatures to obey the different calls of nature will be often opposd and frustrated and that in many animals they would seldom meet with success if every individual was not endued with a passion that summoning all his strength inspired him with a transporting eagerness to overcome the obstacles that hinder him in his great work of selfpreservation the passion i describe is calld anger how a creature possessd of    this passion and selfliking when he sees others enjoy what he wants should be affected with envy can likewise be no mystery after labour the most savage and the most industrious creature seeks rest hence we learn that all of them are furnishd more or less with a love of easea exerting their strength tires them and the loss of spirits experience teaches us is best repaird by food and sleep we see that creatures who in their way of living must meet with the greatest opposition have the greatest share of anger and are born with offensive arms if this anger was to employ a creature always without consideration of the danger he exposed himself to he would soon be destroyd for this reason they are all endued with fear and the lion himself turns tail if the hunters are armd and too numerous from what we observe in the behaviour of brutes we have reason to think that among the more perfect     animals those of the same species have a capacity on many occasions to make their wants known to one another and we are sure of several not only that they understand one another but likewise that they may be made to understand us in comparing our species with that of other animals when we consider the make of man and the qualifications that are obvious in him his superiora capacity in the faculties of thinking and reflecting beyond other creatures his being capable of learn   ing to speak and the usefulness of his hands and fingers there is no room to doubt that he is more fit for society than any other animal we know hor since you wholly reject my lord shaftsburys system i wish you would give me your opinion at large concerning society and the sociableness of man and i will hearken to you with great attention cleo the cause of sociableness in man that is his fitness for society is no such abstruse matter a person of midling capacity that has some experience and a tolerable knowledge of human nature may soon find it out if his desire of knowing the truth be sincere and he will look for it without prepossession but most people that have treated on this subject had a turn to serve and a cause in view which they were resolved to maintain it is very unworthy of a philosopher to say as hobbes did that man is born unfit for society and alledge no better reason for it than the incapacity that infants come into the world with  but some of his adversaries have as far overshot the mark when they asserted that every thing which men can attain to ought to be esteemd as a cause of his fitness for society hor but is there in the mind of man a natural affection that prompts him to love his species beyond what other animals have for theirs or are     we born with hatred and aver   sion that makes us wolves and bears to one another cleo i believe neither from what appears to us in human affairs and the works of nature we have more reason to imagine that the desire as well as aptness of man to associate do not proceed from his love to others than we have to believe that a mutual affection of the planets to one another superiour to what they feel to stars more remote is not the true cause why they keep always moving together in the same solar system hor you dont believe that the stars have any love for one another i am sure then why more reason cleo because there are no phænomena plainly to contradict this love of the planets and we meet with thousands every day to convince us that man centers every thing in himself and neither loves nor hates but for his own sake every individual is a little world by itself and all creatures as far as their understanding and abilities will let them endeavour to make that self happy this in all of them is the continual labour and seems to be the whole design of life hence it follows that in the choice of things men must be determind by the perception they have of happiness and no person can commit or set about an action which at that then present time seems not to be the best to him     hor what will you say then to video meliora proboque deteriora sequor   cleo that only shews the turpitude of our inclinations but men may say what they please every motion in a free agent which he does not approve of is either convulsive or it is not his i speak of those that are subject to the will when two things are left to a persons choice it is a demonstration that he thinks that most eligible which he chuses how contradictory impertinent or pernicious soever his     reason for chusing it may be without this there could be no voluntary suicide and it would be injustice to punish men for their crimes hor i believe every body endeavours to be pleasd but it is inconceivable that creatures of the same species should differ so much from one another as men do in their notions of pleasure and that some of them should take delight in what is the greatest aversion to others all aim at happiness but the question is where it is to be found cleo it is with complete felicity in this world as it is with the philosophers stone both have been sought after many different ways by wise men as well as fools tho neither of them has been obtaind hitherto but in searching after either diligent enquirers have often stumbled by chance on useful discoveries of things they did not look for and which human sagacity labouring with de   sign à priori never would have detected multitudes of our species may in any habitable part of the globe assist one another in a common defence and be raisd into a body politick in which men shall live comfortably together for many centuries without being acquainted with a thousand things that if known would every one of them be instrumental to render the happiness of the publick more complete according to the common notions men have of happiness in one part of the world we have found great and flourishing nations that knew nothing of ships and in others traffick by sea had been in use above two thousand years and navigation had receivd innumerable improvements before they knew how to sail by the help of the loadstone it would be ridiculous to alledge this piece of knowledge either as a reason why man first chose to go to sea or as an argument to prove his natural capacity for maritime affairs to raise a garden it is necessary that we should have a soil and a climate fit for that purpose when we   0 have these we want nothing besides patience but the seeds of vegetables and proper culture fine walks and canals statues summerhouses fountains and caskades are great improvements on the delights of nature but they are not essential to the existence of a garden all nations must have had mean beginnings and it is in those the infancy of    them that the sociableness of man is as conspicuous as it can be ever after man is calld a sociable creature chiefly for two reasons first because it is commonly imagind that he is naturally more fond and desirous of society than any other creature secondly because it is manifest that associating in men turns to better account than it possibly could do in other animals if they were to attempt it hor but why do you say of the first that it is commonly imagind is it not true then cleo i have a very good reason for this caution all men born in society are certainly more desirous of it than any other animal but whether man be naturally so thats a question but if he was it is no excellency nothing to brag of the love man has for his ease and security and his perpetual desire of meliorating his condition must be sufficient motives to make him fond of society considering the necessitous and helpless condition of his nature hor dont you fall into the same error which you say hobbes has been guilty of when you talk of mans necessitous and helpless condition cleo not at all i speak of men and women full grown and the more extensive their knowledge is the higher their quality and the greater their possessions are the more necessitous and helpless they are in their nature  00a nobleman of    or  0 thousand pounds a year that has three or four coaches and six and above fifty people to serve him is in his person considerd singly abstract from what he possesses more necessitous than an obscure man that     has but fifty pounds a year and is used to walk afoot so a lady who never stuck a pin in herself and is dressd and undressd from head to foot like a jointeda baby  by her woman and the assistance of another maid or two is a more helpless creature than doll the dairymaid who all the winter long dresses herself in the dark in less time than the other bestows in placing of her patches hor but is the desire of meliorating our condition which you named so general that no man is without it cleo not one that can be calld a sociable creature and i believe this to be as much a characteristick of our species as any can be named for there is not a man in the world educated in society who if he could compass it by wishing would not have something added to taken from or alterd in his person possessions circumstances or any part of the society he belongs to this is what is not to be perceivd in any creature but man whose great industry in supplying what he calls his wants could never have been known so well as it is if it had not been for the unreasonableness as well as multiplicity of his  0 desires from all which it is manifest that the most civilizd people stand most in need of society and consequently none less than savages the second reason for which i said man was calld sociable is that associating together turnd to better account in our species than it would do in any other if they were to try it to find out the reason of this we must search into humane nature for such qualifications as we excel all other animals in and which the generaiity of men are endued with taught or untaught but in doing this we should neglect nothing that is observable in them from their most early youth to their extreme old age hor i cant see why you use this precaution of taking in the whole age of man would it not be     sufficient to mind those qualifications which he is possessd of when he is come to the height of maturity or his greatest perfection cleo a considerable part of what is calld docility in creatures depends upon the pliableness of the parts and their fitness to be moved with facility which are either entirely lost or very much impaird when they are full grown there is nothing in which our species so far surpasses all others than in the capacity of acquiring the faculty of thinking and speaking well that this is a peculiar property belonging to our nature is very certain yet it is as manifest that this capaci 0 ty vanishes when we come to maturity if till then it has been neglected the term of life likewise that is commonly enjoyd by our species being longer than it is in most other animals we have a prerogative above them in point of time and man has a greater opportunity of advancing in wisdom though not to be acquired but by his own experience than a creature that lives but half his age though it had the same capacity a man of threescore cæteris paribus knows better what is to be embraced or avoided in life than a man of thirty what mitio in excusing the follies of youth said to his brother demea in the adelphi ad omnia alia ætate sapimus rectius  holds among savages as well as among philosophers it is the concurrence of these with other properties that together compose the sociableness of man hor but why may not the love of our species be named as one of these properties cleo first because as i have said already it does not appear that we have it beyond other animals secondly because it is out of the question for if     we examine into the nature of all bodies politick we shall find that no dependance is ever had or stress laid on any such affection either for the raising or maintaining of them  0  hor but the epithet itself the signification of the word imports this love to one another as is manifest from the contrary one who loves solitude is averse to company or of a singular reservd and sullen temper is the very reverse of a sociable man cleo when we compare some men to others the word i own is often used in that sense but when we speak of a quality peculiar to our species and say that man is a sociable creature the word implies no more than that in our nature we have a certain fitness by which great multitudes of us cooperating may be united and formd into one body  that endued with and able to make use of the strength skill and prudence of every individual shall govern itself and act on all emergencies as if it was animated by one soul and actuated by one will i am willing to allow that among the motives that prompt man to enter into society there is a desire which he has naturally after company but he has it for his own sake in hopes of being the better for it and he would never wish for either company or any thing else but for some advantage or other he proposes to himself from it what i deny is that man naturally has such a desire out of a fondness to his species superiour to what other animals have for theirs it is a compliment which we commonly pay to ourselves but there is no more reality in it than  0 in our being one anothers humble servants and i insist upon it that this pretended love of our species and natural affection we are said to have for one another beyond other animals is neither instrumental to the erecting of societies nor ever trusted to in our prudent commerce with one another when associated any more than if it had no existence the undoubted     basis of all societies is government this truth well examind into will furnish us with all the reasons of mans excellency as to sociableness it is evident from it that creatures to be raisd into a community must in the first place be governable this is a qualification that requires fear and some degree of understanding for a creature not susceptible of fear is never to be governd and the more sense and courage it has the more refractory and untractable it will be without the influence of that useful passion and again fear without understanding puts creatures only upon avoiding the danger dreaded without considering what will become of themselves afterwards so wild birds will beat out their brains against the cage before they will save their lives by eatinga there is great difference between being submissive and being governable for he who barely submits to another only embraces what he dislikes to shun what he dislikes more and we may be very submissive and be of no use to the per 0 son we submit to but to be governable implies an endeavour to please and a willingness to exert ourselves in behalf of the person that governs but love beginning every where at home no creature can labour for others and be easy long whilst self is wholly out of the question therefore a creature is then truly governable when reconcild to submission it has learnd to construe his servitude to his own advantage and rests satisfyd with the account it finds for itself in the labour it performs for others several kindsb of animals are or may with little trouble be made thus governable but there is not one creature so tame that it can be made to serve its own species but man yet without this he could never have been made sociable hor but was not man by nature designed for society     cleo we know from revelation that man was made for society hor but if it had not been reveald or you had been a chinese or a mexican what would you answer me as a philosopher cleo that nature had designd man for society as she has made grapes for wine hor to make wine is an invention of man as it is to press oil from olives and other vegetables and to make ropes of hemp cleo and so it is to form a society of independent multitudes and there is nothing that requires greater skill  0  hor but is not the sociableness of man the work of nature or rather of the author of nature divine providence  cleo without doubt but so is the inflate virtue and peculiar aptitude of every thing that grapes are fit to make wine and barley and water to make other liquors is the work of providence but it is     human sagacity that finds out the uses we make of them all the other capacities of man likewise as well as his sociableness are evidently derived from god who made him every thing therefore that our industry can produce or compass is originally owing to the author of our being but when we speak of the works of nature to distinguish them from those of art we mean such as were brought forth without our concurrence so nature in due season produces peas but in england you cannot have them green in january without art and uncommon industry what nature designs she executes herself there are creatures of whom it is visible that nature has designd them for society as is most obvious in bees to whom she has given instincts for that purpose as appears from the effects we owe our being and every thing else to the great author of the universe but as societies cannot subsist without his preserving power so they cannot exist without the concurrence of human wisdom all of them must have a dependance either on mutual  0 compact or the force of the strong exerting itself upon the patience of the weak the difference between the works of art and those of nature is so immense that it is impossible not to know them asunder knowing à priori belongs to god only and divine wisdom acts with an original certainty of which what we call demonstration is but an imperfect borrowd copy amongst the works of nature therefore we see no tryals nor essays they are all compleat and such as she would have them at the first production and where she has not been interrupted highly finishd beyond the reach of our understanding as well as senses wretched man on the contrary is sure of nothing his own existence not excepted but from reasoning à posteriori the consequence of this is that the works of art and human invention are all very lame and defective and most of them pitifully mean at     first our knowledge is advanced by slow degrees and some arts and sciences require the experience of many ages before they can be brought to any tolerable perfection have we any reason to imagine that the society of bees that sent forth the first swarm made worse wax or honey than any of their posterity have produced since and again the laws of nature are fixd and unalterable in all her orders and regulations there is a stabi 0 lity no where to be met with in things of human contrivance and approbation   quid placet aut odio est quod non mutabile credas  is it probable that amongst the bees there has ever been any other form of government than what every swarm submits to now what an infinite variety of speculations what ridiculous schemes have not been proposed amongst men on the subject of government what dissentions in opinion and what fatal quarrels has it not been the occasion of and which is the best form of it is a question to this day undecided the projects good and bad that have been stated for the benefit and more happy establishment of society are innumerable but how shortsighted is our sagacity how fallible human judgment what has seemd highly advantageous to mankind in one age has often been found to be evidently detrimental by the succeeding and even among contemporaries what is reverd in one country is the abomination of another what changes have ever bees made in their furniture or architecture have they ever made cells that were not sexangular or added any tools to those which nature furnishd them with at the beginning what mighty structures have been raisd what prodigious works have been per 0 formd by the great nations of the world toward all these nature has only found materials     the quarry yields marble but it is the sculptor that makes a statue of it to have the infinite variety of iron tools that have been invented nature has given us nothing but the oar which she has hid in the bowels of the earth hor but the capacity of the workmen the inventors of arts and those that improved them has had a great share in bringing those labours to perfection and their genius they had from nature cleo so far as it depended upon the make of their frame the accuracy of the machine they had and no further but this i have allowd already and if you remember what i have said on this head you will find that the part which nature contributed toward the skill and patience of every single person that had a hand in those works was very inconsiderable hor if i have not misunderstood you you would insinuate two things first that the fitness of man for society beyond other animals is something real but that it is hardly perceptible in individuals before great numbers of them are joynd together and artfully managd secondly that this real something this sociableness is a compound that consists in a concurrence of several things and not in any one palpable qua  0lity that man is endued with and brutes are destitute of cleo you are perfectly right every grape contains a small quantity of juice and when great heaps of them are squeezd together they yield a liquor which by skillful management may be made into wine but if we consider how necessary fermentation is to the vinosity of the liquor i mean how essential it is to its being wine it will be evident to us that without great impropriety of speech it cannot be said that in every grape there is wine hor vinosity so far as it is the effect of fermentation is adventitious and what none of the grapes could ever have receivd whilst they remaind single     and therefore if you would compare the sociableness of man to the vinosity of wine you must shew me that in society there is an equivalent for fermentation i mean something that individual persons are not actually possessd of whilst they remain single and which likewise is palpably adventitious to multitudes when joynd together in the same manner as fermentation is to the juice of grapes and as necessary and essential to the compleating of society as that is that same fermentation to procure the vinosity of wine cleo such an equivalent is demonstrable in mutual commerce for if we examine every faculty and qualification from and for which    we judge and pronounce man to be a sociable creature beyond other animals we shall find that a very considerable if not the greatest part of the attribute is acquired and comes upon multitudes from their conversing with one another fabricando fabri fimus men become sociable by living together in society natural affection prompts all mothers to take care of the offspring they dare own so far as to feed and keep them from harm whilst they are helpless but where people are poor and the women have no leisure to indulge themselves in the various expressions of their fondness for their infants which fondling of them ever encreases they are often very remiss in tending and playing with them and the more healthy and quiet such children are the more they are neglected this want of pratling to and stirring up the spirits in babes is often the principal cause of an invincible stupidity as well as ignorance when they are grown up and we often ascribe to natural incapacity what is altogether owing to the neglect of this early instruction we have so few examples of human creatures that never conversd with their own species that it is hard to guess what man would be entirely untaught but we have good reason to believe that   0 the faculty of thinking would be very imperfect in such a one if we consider that the greatest docility can be of no    use to a creature whilst it has nothing to imitate nor any body to teach it hor philosophers therefore are very wisely employd when they discourse about the laws of nature and pretend to determine what a man in the state of nature would think and which way he would reason concerning himself and the creation uninstructed cleo thinking and reasoning justly as mr lock has rightly observed require time and practice  those that have not used themselves to thinking but just on their present necessities make poor work of it when they try beyond that in remote parts and such as are least inhabited we shall find our species come nearer the state of nature than it does in and near great cities and considerable towns even in the most civilizd nations among the most ignorant of such people you may learn the truth of my assertion talk to them about any thing that requires abstract thinking and there is not one in fifty that will understand you any more than a horse would and yet many of them are useful labourers and cunning enough to tell lies and deceive man is a rational creature but he is not endued with reason when he comes into the world nor can he afterwards put it on when he pleases at once as he may a garment speech likewise is a characteristick of our species but no man is born with it    and a dozen generations proceeding from two savages would not produce any tolerable language  nor have we reason to believe that a man could be taught to speak after five and twenty if he had never heard others before that time hor the necessity of teaching whilst the organs are supple and easily yield to impression which you     have spoke of before i believe is of great weight both in speaking and thinking but could a dog or a monkey ever be taught to speak cleo i believe not but i dont think that creatures of another species had ever the pains bestowd upon them that some children have before they can pronounce one word another thing to be considerd is that tho some animals perhaps live longer than we do there is no species that remains young so long as ours and besides what we owe to the superior aptitude to learn which we have from the great accuracy of our frame and inward structure we are not a little indebted for our docility to the slowness and long gradation of our encrease before we are full grown the organs in other creatures grow stiff before ours are come to half their perfection hor so that in the compliment we make to our species of its being endued with speech and sociableness there is no other reality than that by care and industry men may be taught    to speak and be made sociable if the discipline begins when they area very young cleo not otherwise a thousand of our species all grown up that is above five and twenty could never be made sociable if they had been brought up wild and were all strangers to one another hor i believe they could not be civilisd if their education began so late cleo but i mean barely sociable as it is the epithet peculiar to man that is it would be impossible by art to govern them any more than so many wild horses unless you had two or three times that number to watch and keep them in awe therefore it is highly probable that most societies and beginnings of nations were formd in the manner sir william temple supposes it but nothing near so fast and i wonder how a man of his unquestionable good sense could form an idea of justice prudence and wisdom     in an untaught creature or think of a civilisd man before there was any civil society and even before men had commencd to associate hor i have read it i am sure but i dont remember what it is you mean cleo he is just behind you the third shelf from the bottom the first volume pray reach it me it is worth your hearing ———it is in his essay on government  here it is for if we consider man multiplying his kind by the    birth of many children and his cares by providing even necessary food for them till they are able to do it for themselves which happens much later to the generations of men and makes a much longer dependence of children upon parents than we can observe among any other creatures if we consider not only the cares but the industry he is forcd to for the necessary sustenance of his helpless brood either in gathering the natural fruits or raising those which are purchasd with labour and toil if he be forced for supply of this stock to catch the tamer creatures and hunt the wilder sometimes to exercise his courage in defending his little family and fighting with the strong and savage beasts that would prey upon him as he does upon the weak and the mild if we suppose him disposing with discretion and order whatever he gets among his children according to each of their hunger or need sometimes laying up for tomorrow what was more than enough for today at other times pinching himself rather than suffering any of them should want— hor this man is no savage or untaught creature he is fit to be a justice of peace cleo pray let me go on i shall only read this paragraph and as each of them grows up and able to share in the common support teaching them both by lesson and example what he is now to do as the son of his family and what hereafter as the father of another     instructing them all what qualities are good and what are    ill for their health and life or common society which will certainly comprehend whatever is generally esteemd virtue or vice among men cherishing and encouraging dispositions to the good disfavouring and punishing those to the ill and lastly among the various accidents of life lifting up his eyes to heaven when the earth affords him no relief and having recourse to a higher and a greater nature whenever he finds the frailty of his own we must needs conclude that the children of this man cannot fail of being bred up with a great opinion of his wisdom his goodness his valour and his piety and if they see constant plenty in the family they believe well of his fortune too hor did this man spring out of the earth i wonder or did he drop from the sky cleo there is no manner of absurdity in supposing hor the discussion of this would too far engage us i am sure i have tired you already with my impertinence cleo you have pleasd me extremely the questions you have askd have all been very pertinent and such as every man of sense would make that had not made it his business to think on these things i read that passage on purpose to you to make some use of it but if you are weary of the subject i will not trespass upon your patience any longer hor you mistake me i begin to be fond of the subject but before we talk of it any    further i have a mind to run over that essay again it is a great while since i read it and after that i shall be glad to resume the discourse the sooner the better i know you are a lover of fine fruit if youll dine with me tomorrow ill give you an ananas cleo i love your company so well that i can refuse no opportunity of enjoying it hor a revoir then cleo your servant     the fifth dialogue    the fifth dialogue between horatio and cleomenes cleomenes it excells every thing it is extremely rich without being luscious and i know nothing to which i can compare the taste of it to me it seems to be a collection of different fine flavours that puts me in mind of several delicious fruits which yet are all outdone by it hor i am glad it pleasd you cleo the scent of it likewise is wonderfully reviving as you was paring it a fragrancy i thought perfumd the room that was perfectly cordial hor the inside of the rind has an oyliness of no disagreeable smell that upon handling of it sticks to ones fingers for a consider   able time for tho now i have washd and wiped my hands the flavour of it will not be entirely gone from them by tomorrow morning cleo this was the third i ever tasted of our own     growth the production of them in these northern climates is no small instance of human industry and our improvements in gardning it is very elegant to enjoy the wholsome air of temperate regions and at the same time be able to raise fruit to its highest maturity that naturally requires the sun of the torrid zone hor it is easy enough to procure heat but the great art consists in finding out and regulating the degrees of it at pleasure without which it would be impossible to ripen an ananas here and to compass this with that exactness as it is done by the help of thermometers was certainly a fine invention— cleo i dont care to drink any more hor just as you please otherwise i was going to name a health which would not have come mal a propos cleo whose is that pray hor i was thinking on the man to whom we are in a great measure obliged for the production and culture of the exotick we were speaking of in this kingdom sir matthew decker  the first ananas or pineapple that was brought to perfection in england grew in his garden at richmond   0 cleo with all my heart let us finish with that he is a beneficent and i believe a very honest man hor it would not be easy to name another who with the same knowledge of the world and capacity of getting money is equally disinterested and inoffensive— cleo have you considerd the things we discoursed of yesterday hor i have thought on nothing else since i saw you this morning i went through the whole essay and with more attention than i did formerly i like     it very well only that passage which you read yesterday and some others to the same purpose i cannota reconcile with the account we have of mans origin from the bible  since all are descendants of adam and consequently of noah and his posterity      how came savages into the world  cleo the history of the world as to very ancient times is very imperfect  what devastations have been made by war by pestilence and by famine what distress some men have been drove to and how strangely our race has been dispersd and scatterd over the earth since the flood we dont know hor but persons that are well instructed themselves never fail of teaching their children and we have no reason to think that knowing civilizd men as the sons of noah were should have neglected their offspring but it is altogether incredible as all are de   scendants from them that succeeding generations instead of encreasing in experience and wisdom should learn backward and still more and more abandon their broods in such a manner as to degenerate at last to what you call the state of nature      cleo whether you intend this as a sarcasm or not i dont know but you have raisd no difficulty that can render the truth of the sacred history suspected holy writ has acquainted us with the miraculous origin of our species and the small remainder of it after the deluge but it is far from informing us of all the revolutions that have happend among mankind since the old testament hardly touches upon any particulars that had no relation to the jews  neither does moses pretend to give a full account of every thing that happend to or was transacted by our first parents he names none of adams daughters and takes no notice of several things that must have happend in the beginning of the world as is evident from cains building a city  and several other circumstances from which it is plain that moses meddled with nothing but what was material and to his purpose which in that part of his history was to trace the descent of the patriarchs from the first man but that there are savages is certain most nations of europe have met with wild men and women in     several parts of the world that were ignorant    of the use of letters and among whom they could observe no rule or government hor that there are savages i dont question and from the great number of slaves that are yearly fetchd from africa  it is manifest that in some parts there must be vast swarms of people that have not yet made a great hand of their sociableness but how to derive them all from the sons of noah i own is past my skill cleo youll find it as difficult to account for the loss of the many fine arts and useful inventions of the ancients which the world has certainly sustaind but the fault i find with sir william temple is in the character of his savage just reasoning and such an orderly way of proceeding as he makes him act in are unnatural to a wild man in such a one the passions must be boisterous and continually jostling and succeeding one another no untaught man could have a regular way of thinking or pursue any one design with steadiness hor you have strange notions of our species but has not a man by the time that he comes to maturity some notions of right and wrong that are natural cleo before i answer your question i would have you consider that among savages there must be always a great difference as to the wildness or tameness of them all creatures naturally love their offspring whilst    they are helpless and so does man but in the savage state men are more liable to accidents and misfortunes than they are in society as to the rearing of their young ones and therefore the children of savages must very often be put to  00 their shifts so as hardly to remember by the time that they are grown up that they had any parents if this happens too early and they are dropt or lost before they are four or five years of age they must perish either die for want or be devourd by beasts of prey unless some other creature takes care of them those orphans that survive and become their own masters very young must when they are come to maturity be much wilder than others that have lived many years under the tuition of parents hor but would not the wildest man you can imagine have from nature some thoughts of justice and injustice cleo such a one i believe would naturally without much thinking in the case take every thing to be his own that he could lay his hands on hor then they would soon be undeceivd if two or three of them met together cleo that they would soon disagree and quarrel is highly probable but i dont believe they ever would be undeceivd hor at this rate men could never be formd into an aggregate body how came society into the world     cleo as i told you from private families but not without great difficulty and the concurrence of many favourable accidents and many generations may pass before there is any likelihood of their being formd into a society hor that men are formd into societies we see but if they are all born with that false notion and they can never be undeceivd which way do you account for it cleo my opinion concerning this matter is this selfpreservation bids all creatures gratify their appetites and that of propagating his kind never fails to affect a man in health many years before he comes to his full growth if a wild man and a wild woman  0  should meet very young and live together for fifty years undisturbd in a mild wholesome climate where there is plenty of provisions they might see a prodigious number of descendants for in the wild state of nature man multiplies his kind much faster than can be allowd of in any regular society no male at fourteen would be long without a female if he could get one and no female of twelve would be refractory if applied to or remain long uncourted if there were men hor considering that consanguinity would be no bar among these people the progeny of two savages might soon amount to hundreds all this i can grant you but as pa   rents no better qualifyd could teach their children but little it would be impossible for them to govern these sons and daughters when they grew up if none of them had any notions of right or wrong and society is as far off as ever the false principle which you say all men are born with is an obstacle never to be surmounted cleo from that false principle as you call it the right men naturally claim to every thing they can get it must follow that man will look upon his children as his property and make such use of them as is most consistent with his interest hor what is the interest of a wild man that pursues nothing with steadiness cleo the demand of the predominant passion for the time it lasts hor that may change every moment and such children would be miserably managed cleo thats true but still managed they would be i mean they would be kept under and forcd to do as they were bid at least till they were strong enough to resist natural affection would prompt a wild man to love and cherish his child it would make him provide food and other necessaries for his son till he was ten or twelve years old or perhaps  0  longer but this affection is not the only passion he has to gratify if his son provokes him by stubborness or doing otherwise than he would have him this love is    suspended and if his displeasure be strong enough to raise his anger which is as natural to him as any other passion it is ten to one but hell knock him down if he hurts him very much and the condition he has put his son in moves his pity his anger will cease and natural affection returning hell fondle him again and be sorry for what he has done now if we consider that all creatures hate and endeavour to avoid pain and that benefits beget love in all that receive them we shall find that the consequence of this management would be that the savage child would learn to love and fear his father these two passions together with the esteem which we naturally have for every thing that far excels us will seldom fail of producing that compound which we call reverence  hor i have it now you have opend my eyes and i see the origin of society as plain as i do that table cleo i am afraid the prospect is not so clear yet as you imagine hor why so the grand obstacles are removd untaught men it is true when they are grown up are never to be governd and our subjection is never sincere where the superiority of the governour is not very apparent but both these are obviated the reverence we have for a person when we are young is easily continued as long as we live and where authority is once acknowledgd    and that acknowledgment well establishd it cannot be a difficult matter to govern if thus a man may keep up  0  his authority over his children hell do it still with greater ease over his grandchildren for a child that has the least reverence for his parents will seldom refuse homage to the person to whom he sees his father pay it besides a mans pride would be a sufficient motive for him to maintain the authority once gaind and if some of his progeny proved refractory he would leave no stone unturnd by the help of the rest to reduce the disobedient the old man being dead the authority from him would devolve upon the eldest of his children and so on cleo i thought you would go on too fast if the wild man had understood the nature of things and been endued with general knowledge and a language ready made as adam was by miracle what you say might have been easy but an ignorant creature that knows nothing but what his own experience has taught him is no more fit to govern than he is fit to teach the mathematicks hor he would not have above one or two children to govern at first and his experience would encrease by degrees as well as his family this would require no such consummate knowledge cleo i dont say it would an ordinary capacity of a man tollerably well educated    would be sufficient to begin with but a man who never had been taught to curb any of his passions would be very unfit for such a task he would make his children as soon as they were able assist him in getting food and teach them how and where to procure it savage children as they got strength would endeavour to imitate every action they saw their parents do and every sound they heard them make but all the instructions they receivd would be confind to things immediately necessary savage parents would often take offence at their children as they grew up without a cause and as these encreasd in years so natural affection would decrease in the other the consequence would  0  be that the children would often suffer for failings that were not their own savages would often discover faults in the conduct of what was past but they would not be able to establish rules for future behaviour which they would approve of themselves for any continuance and want of foresight would be an inexhaustible fund for changes in their resolutions the savages wife as well as himself would be highly pleasd to see their daughters impregnated and bring forth and they would both take great delight in their grandchildren hor i thought that in all creatures the natural affection of parents had been confind to their own young ones     cleo it is so in all but man there is no species but ours that are so conceited of themselves as to imagine every thing to be theirs the desire of dominion is a neverfailing consequence of the pride that is common to all men and which the brat of a savage is as much born with as the son of an emperour this good opinion we have of ourselves makes men not only claim a right to their children but likewise imagine that they have a great share of jurisdiction over their grandchildren the young ones of other animals as soon as they can help themselves are free but the authority which parents pretend to have over their children never ceases how general and unreasonable this eternal claim is naturally in the heart of man we may learn from the laws which to prevent the usurpation of parents and rescue children from their dominion every civil society is forcd to make limiting paternal authority to a certain term of years our savage pair would have a double title to their grandchildren from their undoubted property in each parent of them and all the progeny being sprung from their own sons and daughters without intermixture of foreign blood they would look upon the  0  whole race to be their natural vassals and i am persuaded that the more knowledge and capacity of reasoning this first couple acquired the more just and   0unquestionable their sovereignty over all their descendants would appear to them tho they should live to see the fifth or sixth generation hor is it not strange that nature should send us all into the world with a visible desire after government and no capacity for it at all cleo what seems strange to you is an undeniable instance of divine wisdom for if all had not been born with this desire all must have been destitute of it and multitudes could never have been formd into societies if some of them had not been possessed of this thirst of dominion creatures may commit force upon themselves they may learn to warp their natural appetites and divert them from their proper objects but peculiar instincts that belong to a whole species are never to be acquird by art or discipline and those that are born without them must remain destitute of them for ever ducks run to the water as soon as they are hatchd but you can never make a chicken swim any more than you can teach it to suck hor i understand you very well if pride had not been innate to all men none of them could ever have been ambitious and as to the capacity of governing experience shews us that it is to be acquired but how to bring society into the world i know no more than the wild man himself what you    have suggested to me of his unskilfulness and want of power to govern himself has quite destroyd all the hopes i had conceivd of society from this family but would religion have no influence upon them pray how came that into the world cleo from god by miracle hor obscurum per obscurius i dont understand miracles that break in upon and subvert the order  0  of nature and i have no notion of things that come to pass en depît de bon sens and are such that judging from sound reason and known experience all wise men would think themselves mathematically sure that they could never happen cleo it is certain that by the word miracle is meant an interposition of the divine power when it deviates from the common course of nature hor as when matters easily combustible remain whole and untouchd in the midst of a fire fiercely burning or lions in vigour industriously kept hungry forbear eating what they are most greedy after  these miracles are strange things cleo they are not pretended to be otherwise the etymology of the word imports it but it is almost as unaccountable that men should disbelieve them and pretend to be of a religion that is altogether built upon miracles     hor but when i askd you that general question why did you confine yourself to reveald religion cleo because nothing in my opinion deserves the name of religion that has not been reveald the jewish was the first that was national and the christian the next hor but abraham noah and adam himself were no jews and yet they had religion cleo no other than what was reveald to them god appeard to our first parents and gave them commands immediately after he had created them the same intercourse was continued between the supream being and the patriarchs but the father of abraham was an idolater hor but the ægyptians the greeks and the romans had religion as well as the jews cleo their gross idolatry and abominable worship i call superstition hor youmay be as partial as you please but they  0  all calld their worship religion as well as we do ours you say man brings nothing with him but his passions and when i askd you how religion came into the world i meant what is there in mans nature that is not acquired from which he has a tendency to religion what is it that disposes him to it cleo fear     hor how primus in orbe deos fecit timor  are you of that opinion cleo no man upon earth less but that noted epicurean axiom which irreligious men are so fond of is a very poor one and it is silly as well as impious to say that fear made a god you may as justly say that fear made grass or the sun and the moon but when i am speaking of savages it is not clashing either with good sense nor the christian religion to assert that whilst such men are ignorant of the true deity and yet very defective in the art of thinking and reasoning fear is the passion that first gives them an opportunity of entertaining some glimmering notions of an invisible power   which afterwards as  0  by practice and experience they grow greater proficients and become more perfect in the labour of the brain and the exercise of their highest faculty will infallibly lead them to the certain knowledge of an infinite and eternal being whose power and wisdom will always appear the greater and more stupendious to them the more they themselves advance in knowledge and penetration though both should be carried on to a much higher pitch than it is possible for our limited nature ever to arrive at hor i beg your pardon for suspecting you though i am glad it gave you an opportunity of explaining yourself the word fear    without any addition sounded very harsh and even now i cannot conceive how an invisible cause should become the object of a mans fear that should be so entirely untaught as you have made the first savage which way can any thing invisible and that affects none of the senses make an impression upon a wild creature cleo every mischief and every disaster that happens to him of which the cause is not very plain and obvious excessive heat and cold wet and drought that are offensive thunder and lightning even when they do no visible hurt noises in the dark obscurity itself and every thing that is frightful and unknown are all administring and contributing to the establishment of this fear the wildest man that can be conceivd by the time that he came to maturity would be wise enough to know that fruits and other eatables are not to be had either always or every where this would naturally put him upon hoarding when he had good store his provision might be spoild by the rain he would see that trees were  0  blasted and yielded not always the same plenty he might not always be in health or his young ones might grow sick and die without any wounds or external force to be seen some of these accidents might at first escape his attention or only alarm his weak understanding without occasioning much reflecti   on for some time but as they came often he would certainly begin to suspect some invisible cause and as his experience encreased be confirmd in his suspicion it is likewise highly probable that a variety of different sufferings would make him apprehend several such causes and at last induce him to believe that there was a great number of them which he had to fear what would very much contribute to this credulous disposition and naturally lead him into such a belief is a false notion we imbibe very early and which we may observe in infants as soon as by their looks their gestures and the signs they make they begin to be intelligible to us hor what is that pray cleo all young children seem to imagine that every thing thinks and feels in the same manner as they do themselves and that they generally have this wrong opinion of things inanimate is evident from a common practice among them whenever they labour under any misfortune which their own wildness and want of care have drawn upon them in all such cases you see them angry at and strike a table a chair the floor or any thing else that can seem to have been accessary to their hurting themselves or the production of any other blunder they have committed nurses we see in compliance to their frailty seem to en   tertain the same ridiculous sentiments and actually appease wrathful brats by pretending to take their part thus youll often see them very serious in scolding at and beating either the real object of the babys indignation or something else on which the blame of what has happend   0 may be thrown with any shew of probability it is not to be imagind that this natural folly should be so easily cured in a child that is destitute of all instruction and commerce with his own species as it is in those that are brought up in society and hourly improvd by conversing with others that are wiser than themselves and i am persuaded that a wild man would never get entirely rid of it whilst he lived hor i cannot think so meanly of human understanding cleo whence came the dryades and hamadryades how came it ever to be thought impious to cut down or even to wound large venerable oaks or other stately trees and what root did the divinity spring from which the vulgar among the ancient heathens apprehended to be in rivers and fountains hor from the roguery of designing priests and other impostors that invented those lies and made fables for their own advantage cleo but still it must have been want of understanding and a tincture some re   mainder of that folly which is discoverd in young children that could induce or would suffer men to believe those fables unless fools actually had frailties knaves could not make use of them hor there may be something in it but be that as it will you have ownd that man naturally loves those he receives benefits from therefore how comes it that man finding all the good things he enjoys to proceed from an invisible cause his gratitude should not sooner prompt him to be religious than his fear cleo there are several substantial reasons why it does not man takes every thing to be his own which he has from nature sowing and reaping he thinks deserve a crop and whatever he has the least hand     in is always reckond to be his every art and every invention as soon as we know them are our right and property and whatever we perform by the assistance of them is by the courtesy of the species to itself deemd to be our own we make use of fermentation and all the chymistry of nature without thinking ourselves beholden to any thing but our own knowledge she that churnsa the cream makes the butter without enquiring into the power by which the thin lymphatick particles are forced to separate themselves and slide away from the more unctious in brewing baking cooking and    almost every thing we have a hand in nature is the drudge that makes all the alterations and does the principal work yet all forsooth is our own from all which it is manifest that man who is naturally for making every thing centre in himself must in his wild state have a great tendency and be very prone to look upon every thing he enjoys as his due and every thing he meddles with as his own performance it requires knowledge and reflection and a man must be pretty far advanced in the art of thinking justly and reasoning consequentially before he can from his own light and without being taught be sensible of his obligations to god the less a man knows and the more shallow his understanding is the less he is capable either of enlarging his prospect of things or drawing consequences from the little which he does know raw ignorant and untaught men fix their eyes on what is immediately before and seldom look further than as it is vulgarly expressd the length of their noses the wild man if gratitude moved him would much sooner pay his respects to the tree he gathers his nuts from than he would think of an acknowledgment to him who had planted it and there is no property so well establishd but a civilizd man would suspect his title to it sooner     than a wild one would question the sovereignty he has over his own breath    another reason why fear is an elder motive to religion than gratitude is that an untaught man would never suspect that the same cause which he receivd good from would ever do him hurt and evil without doubt would always gain his attention first hor men indeed seem to remember one ill turn that is servd them better than ten good ones one months sickness better than ten years health cleo in all the labours of selfpreservation man is intent on avoiding what is hurtful to him but in the enjoyment of what is pleasant his thoughts are relaxd and he is void of care he can swallow a thousand delights one after another without asking questions but the least evil makes him inquisitive whence it came in order to shun it it is very material therefore to know the cause of evil but to know that of good which is always welcome is of little use that is such a knowledge seems not to promise any addition to his happiness when a man once apprehends such an invisible enemy it is reasonable to think that he would be glad to appease and make him his friend if he could find him out it is highly probable likewise that in order to this he would search investigate and look every where about him and that finding all his enquiries upon earth in vain he would lift up his eyes to the sky   0 hor and so a wild man might and look down and up again long enough before he would be the wiser i can easily conceive that a creature must labour under great perplexities when it actually fears something of which it knows neither what it is nor where it is and that though a man had all the reason in the world to think it invisible he would still be more afraid of it in the dark than when he could see cleo whilst a man is but an imperfect thinker     and wholly employd in furthering selfpreservation in the most simple manner and removing the immediate obstacles he meets with in that pursuit this affair perhaps affects him but little but when he comes to be a tollerable reasoner and has leisure to reflect it must produce strange chimeras and surmises and a wild couple would not converse together long before they would endeavour to express their minds to one another concerning this matter and as in time they would invent and agree upon certain sounds of distinction for several things of which the ideas would often occur so i believe that this invisible cause would be one of the first which they would coin a name for a wild man and a wild woman would not take less care of their helpless brood than other animals and it is not to be imagind but the children that were brought up by them tho without in   struction or discipline would before they were ten years old observe in their parents this fear of an invisible cause it is incredible likewise considering how much men differ from one another in features complexion and temper that all should form the same idea of this cause from whence it would follow that as soon as any considerable number of men could intelligibly converse together it would appear that there were different opinions among them concerning the invisible cause the fear and acknowledgment of it being universal and man always attributing his own passions to every thing which he conceives to think every body would be sollicitous to avoid the hatred and illwill and if it was possible to gain the friendship of such a power if we consider these things and what we know of the nature of man it is hardly to be conceivd that any considerable number of our species could have any intercourse together long in peace or otherwise but willful lies would be raisd concerning this power and some would pretend to have seen or heard it     how different opinions about invisible power may by the malice and deceit of impostors be made the occasion of mortal enmity among multitudes is easily accounted for if we want rain very much and i can be persuaded that it is your fault we have none there needs no greater cause to    quarrel and nothing has happend in the world of priestcraft or inhumanity folly or abomination on religious accounts that cannot be solved or explained with the least trouble from these data and the principle of fear hor i think i must yield to you that the first motive of religion among savages was fear but you must allow me in your turn that from the general thankfulness that nations have always paid to their gods for signal benefits and success the many hecatombs that have been offerd after victories and the various institutions of games and festivals it is evident that when men came to be wiser and more civilizd the greatest part of their religion was built upon gratitude cleo you labour hard i see to vindicate the honour of our species but we have no such cause to boast of it and i shall demonstrate to you that a wellweighd consideration and a thorough understanding of our nature will give us much less reason to exult in our pride than it will furnish us with for the exercise of our humility in the first place there is no difference between the original nature of a savage and that of a civilizd man they are both born with fear and neither of them if they have their senses about them can live many years but an invisible power will at one time or other become    the object of that fear and this will happen to every man whether he be wild and alone or in society and under the best discipline we know by experience that empires states and kingdoms may excell in arts and sciences politeness and all worldly     wisdom and at the same time be slaves to the grossest idolatry and submit to all the inconsistencies of a false religion the most civilizd people have been as foolish and absurd in sacred worship as it is possible for any savages to be and the first have often been guilty of studyd cruelties which the latter would never have thought of the carthaginians were a subtle flourishing people an opulent and formidable nation and hannibal had half conquerd the romans when still to their idols they sacrificd the children of their chief nobility and as to private persons there are innumerable instances in the most polite ages of men of sense and virtue that have entertaind the most miserable unworthy and extravagant notions of the supreme being what confusd and unaccountable apprehensions must not some men have had of providence to act as they did alexander severus who succeeded heliogabalus was a great reformer of abuses and thought to be as good a prince as his predecessor was a bad one in his palace he had an oratory a cabinet set aside for his private devotion where he had the    images of apollonius thyanæus  orpheus abraham jesus christ and such like gods says his historian what makes you smile hor to think how industrious priests are in concealing a mans failings when they would have you think well of him what you say of severus i had read before when looking one day for something in moreri i happend to cast my eye on the article of that emperour  where no mention is made either of orpheus or apollonius which remembring the passage in lampridius  i wonderd at and thinking     that i might have been mistaken i again consulted that author where i found it as you have related it i dont question but moreri left this out on purpose to repay the civilities of the emperour to the christians whom he tells us severus had been very favourable to cleo thats not impossible in a roman catholick but what i would speak to in the second place is the festivals you mentiond the hecatombs after victories and the general thankfulness of nations to their gods i desire you would consider that in sacred matters as well as all human affairs there are rites and ceremonies and many demonstrations of respect to be seen that to outward appearance seem to proceed from gratitude which upon due examination will be found to have been originally the result of fear at what time the floral games were first    instituted is not well known  but they never were celebrated every year constantly before a very unseasonable spring put the senate upon the decree that made them annual to make up the true compound of reverence or veneration love and esteem are as necessary ingredients as fear but the latter alone is capable of making men counterfeit both the former as is evident from the duties that are outwardly paid to tyrants at the same time that inwardly they are execrated and hated idolaters have always behaved themselves to every invisible cause they adored as     men do to a lawless arbitrary power when they reckon it as captious haughty and unreasonable as they allow it to be sovereign unlimited and irresistible what motive could the frequent repetitions of the same solemnities spring from whenever it was suspected that the least holy trifle had been omitted you know how often the same farce was once acted over again because after every performance there was still room to apprehend that some thing had been neglected do but consult i beg of you and call to mind your own reading cast your eyes on the infinite variety of ideas men have formd to themselves and the vast multitude of divisions they have made of the invisible cause which every one imagines to influence human affairs run over the history of all ages look into every considerable nation their streights    and calamities as well as victories and successes the lives of great generals and other famous men their adverse fortune and prosperity mind at which times their devotion was most fervent when oracles were most consulted and on what accounts the gods were most frequently addressd do but calmly consider every thing you can remember relating to superstition whether grave ridiculous or execrable and you will find in the first place that the heathens and all that have been ignorant of the true deity tho many of them were persons otherwise of great knowledge fine understanding and tried probity have represented their gods not as wise benign equitable and merciful but on the contrary as passionate revengeful capricious and unrelenting beings not to mention the abominable vices and gross immoralities the vulgar were taught to ascribe to them in the second that for every one instance that men have addressd themselves to an invisible cause from a principle of gratitude there are a thousand in every false religion to convince you that divine worship and mens     submission to heaven have always proceeded from their fear the word religion itself and the fear of god are synonimous and had mans acknowledgment been originally founded in love as it is in fear the craft of impostors could have made no advantage of the passion and all their boasted    acquaintance with gods and goddesses would have been useless to them if men had worshipd the immortal powers as they calld their idols out of gratitude hor all lawgivers and leaders of people gaind their point and acquired what they expected from those pretences which is reverence and which to produce you have ownd yourself love and esteem to be as requisite as fear cleo but from the laws they imposed on men and the punishments they annexd to the breach and neglect of them it is easily seen which of the ingredients they most relied upon hor it would be difficult to name a king or other great man in very ancient times who attempted to govern any infant nation that laid no claim to some commerce or other with an invisible power either held by himself or his ancestors between them and moses there is no other difference than that he alone was a true prophet and really inspired and all the rest were impostors cleo what would you infer from this hor that we can say no more for ourselves than what men of all parties and persuasions have done in all ages every one for their cause viz that they alone were in the right and all that differd from them in the wrong     cleo is it not sufficient that we can say this of ourselves with truth and justice after the strictest examination when no other cause can stand any test or bear the least enquiry a man may relate miracles that never were wrought and give an account of things that never happend but a     thousand years hence all knowing men will agree that no body could have wrote sir isaac newtons principia unless he had been a great mathematician when moses acquainted the israelites with what had been reveald to him he told them a truth which no body then upon earth knew but himself hor you mean the unity of god and his being the author of the universe cleo i do so hor but is not every man of sense capable of knowing this from his reason cleo yes when the art of reasoning consequentially is come to that perfection which it has been arrived at these several hundred years and himself has been led into the method of thinking justly every common saylor could steer a course through the midst of the ocean as soon as the use of the loadstone and the mariners compass were invented but before that the most expert navigator would have trembled at the thoughts of such an enterprise when moses acquainted and imbued the posterity of jacob with this sublime and important truth they were    degenerated into slaves attachd to the superstition of the country they dwelld in and the ægyptians their masters tho they were great proficients in many arts and sciences and more deeply skilld in the mysteries of nature than any other nation then was had the most abject and abominable notions of the deity which it is possible to conceive and no savages could have exceeded their ignorance and stupidity as to the supreme being the invisible cause that governs the world he taught the israelites à priori and their children before they were nine or ten years old knew what the greatest philosophers did not attain to by the light of nature till many ages after hor the advocates for the ancients will never allow that any modern philosophers have either   0 thought or reasond better than men did in former ages cleo let them believe their eyes what you say every man of sense may know by his own reason was in the beginning of christianity contested and denied with zeal and vehemence by the greatest men in rome celsus symmachus porphyry hierocles  and other famous rhetoricians and men of unquestionable good sense wrote in defence of idolatry and strenuously maintained the plurality and multiplicity of their gods moses lived above fifteen hundred years before the reign of augustus if in a place where i was ve  0ry well assured that no body understood any thing of colouring or drawing a man should tell me that he had acquired the art of painting by inspiration i should be more ready to laugh at him than to believe him but if i saw him draw several fine portraicts before my face my unbelief would cease and i should think it ridiculous any longer to suspect his veracity all the accounts that other lawgivers and founders of nations have given of the deities which they or their predecessors conversd with containd ideas that were unworthy of the divine being and by the light of nature only it is easily provd that they must have been false but the image which moses gave the jews of the supreme being that he was one and had made heaven and earth will stand all tests and is a truth that will outlast the world thus i think i have fully proved     on the one hand that all true religion must be reveald and could not have come into the world without miracle and on the other that what all men are born with towards religion before they receive any instruction is fear hor you have convinced me many ways that we are poor creatures by nature but i cant help strugling against those mortifying truths when i hear them started first i long to hear the origin of society and i continually retard your account of it myself with new questions     cleo do you remember where we left off hor i dont think we have made any progress yet for we have nothing towards it but a wild man and a wild woman with some children and grandchildren which they are not able either to teach or to govern cleo i thought that the introduction of the reverence which the wildest son must feel more or less for the most savage father if he stays with him had been a considerable step hor i thought so too till you destroyd the hopes i had conceivd of it yourself by shewing me the incapacity of savage parents to make use of it and since we are still as far from the origin of society as ever we were or ever can be in my opinion i desire that before you proceed to that main point you would answer what you have put off once already which is my question concerning the notions of right and wrong i cannot be easy before i have your sentiments on this head cleo your demand is very reasonable and i will satisfy you as well as i can a man of sense learning and experience that has been well educated will always find out the difference between right and wrong in things diametrically opposite and there are certain facts which he will always condemn and others which he will always approve of to kill     a member of the same society that has    not offended us or to rob him will always be bad and to cure the sick and be beneficent to the publick he will always pronounce to be good actions in themselves and for a man to do as he would be done by he will always say is a good rule in life and not only men of great accomplishments and such as have learnd to think abstractly but all men of midling capacities that have been brought up in society will agree in this in all countries and in all ages nothing likewise seems more true to all that have made any tolerable use of their faculty of thinking than that out of the society before any division was made either by contract or otherwise all men would have an equal right to the earth but do you believe that our wild man if he had never seen any other human creature but his savage consort and his progeny would ever have entertaind the same notions of right and wrong hor hardly his small capacity in the art of reasoning would hinder him from doing it so justly and the power he found he had over his children would render him very arbitrary cleo but without that incapacity suppose that at threescore he was by a miracle to receive a fine judgment and the faculty of thinking and reasoning consequentially in as great a perfection as the wisest man ever had it do you think hed ever alter his no   tion of the right he had to every thing he could manage or have other sentiments in relation to himself and his progeny than from his behaviour it appeard he entertaind when he seemd to act almost altogether by instinct hor without doubt for if judgment and reason were given him what could hinder him from making use of those faculties as well as others do cleo you seem not to consider that no man can reason but à posteriori from something that he knows     or supposes to be true what i said of the difference between right and wrong i spoke of persons who remembred their education and lived in society or at least such as plainly saw others of their own species that were independent of them and either their equals or superiours hor i begin to believe you are in the right but at second thoughts why might not a man with great justice think himself the sovereign of a place where he knew no human creature but his own wife and the descendents of both cleo with all my heart but may there not be an hundred such savages in the world with large families that might never meet nor ever hear of one another hor a thousand if you will and then there would be so many natural sovereigns     cleo very well what i would have you observe is that there are things which are commonly esteemd to be eternal truths that an hundred or a thousand people of fine sense and judgment could have no notion of what if it should be true that every man is born with this domineering spirit and that we cannot be cured of it but by our commerce with others and the experience of facts by which we are convincd that we have no such right let us examine a mans whole life from his infancy to his grave and see which of the two seems to be most natural to him a desire of superiority and grasping every thing to himself or a tendency to act according to the reasonable notions of right and wrong and we shall find that in his early youth the first is very conspicuous that nothing appears of the second before he has receivd some instructions and that this latter will always have less influence upon his actions the more uncivilisd he remains from whence i infer that the notions of right and wrong are acquired for if they were as natural or if they affected us as     early as the opinion or rather the instinct we are born with of taking every thing to be our own no child would ever cry for his eldest brothers playthings hor i think there is no right more natural nor more reasonable than that which    men have over their children and what we owe our parents can never be repaid cleo the obligations we have to good parents for their care and education is certainly very great hor thats the least we are indebted to them for our being we might be educated by an hundred others but without them we could never have existed cleo so we could have no malt liquor without the ground that bears the barley i know no obligations for benefits that never were intended should a man see a fine parcel of cherries be tempted to eat and devour them accordingly with great satisfaction it is possible he might swallow some of the stones which we know by experience dont digest if twelve or fourteen months after he should find a little sprig of a cherrytree growing in a field where no body would expect it if he recollected the time he had been there before it is not improbable that he might guess at the true reason how it came there it is possible likewise that for curiositys sake this man might take up this plant and take care of it i am well assured that whatever became of it afterwards the right he would have to it from the merit of his action would be the same which a savage would have to his child      hor i think there would be a vast difference between the one and the other the    cherrystone was never part of himself nor mixd with his blood cleo pardon me all the difference as vast as you take it to be can only consist in this that the cherrystone was not part of the man who swallowd it so long nor receivd so great an alteration in its figure whilst it was as some other things which the savage swallowd were and receivd in their figure whilst they stayd with him hor but he that swallowd the cherrystone did nothing to it it produced a plant as a vegetable which it might have done as well without his swallowing it cleo thats true and i own that as to the cause to which the plant owes its existence you are in the right but i plainly spoke as to the merit of the action which in either case could only proceed from their intentions as free agents and the savage might and would in all probability act with as little design to get a child as the other had eat cherries in order to plant a tree it is commonly said that our children are our own flesh and blood but this way of speaking is strangely figurative however allow it to be just tho rhetoriciens have no name for it what does it prove what benevolence in us what kindness to others in the intention hor you shall say what you please but i think that nothing can endear children to    their parents more than the reflection that they are their own flesh and blood cleo i am of your opinion and it is a plain demonstration of the superlative value we have for our own selves and every thing that comes from us if it be good and counted laudable whereas other things that are offensive tho equally our own are in compliment to ourselves industriously conceald and as soon as it is agreed upon that any thing is unseemly and rather a disgrace to us than otherwise     presently it becomes ill manners to name or so much as to hint at it the contents of the stomach are variously disposed of but we have no hand in that and whether they go to the blood or elsewhere the last thing we did to them voluntarily and with our knowledge was swallowing them and whatever is afterwards performd by the animal oeconomy a man contributes no more to than he does to the going of his watch this is another instance of the unjust claim we lay to every performance we are but in the least concernd in if good comes of it tho nature does all the work but whoever places a merit in his prolifick faculty ought likewise to expect the blame when he has the stone or a fever without this violent principle of innate folly no rational creature would value himself on his free agency and at the same time accept of applause for actions that are visibly independent    of his will life in all creatures is a compound action but the share they have in it themselves is only passive we are forcd to breathe before we know it and our continuance palpably depends upon the guardianship and perpetual tutelage of nature whilst every part of her works ourselves not excepted is an impenetrable secret  to us that eludes all enquiries nature furnishes us with all the substance of our food herself nor does she trust to our wisdom for an appetite to crave it to chew it she teaches us by instinct and bribes us to it by pleasure this seeming to be an action of choice and ourselves being conscious of the performance we perhaps may be said to have a part in it but the moment after nature resumes her care and again withdrawn from our knowledge preserves us in a mysterious manner without any help or concurrence of ours that we are sensible of since then the management of what we have eat and drank     remains entirely under the direction of nature what honour or shame ought we to receive from any part of the product whether it is to serve as a doubtful means toward generation or yields to vegetation a less fallible assistance it is nature that prompts us to propagate as well as to eat and a savage man multiplies his kind by instinct as other animals do without more thought or design of preserving his species than a newborn infant    has of keeping itself alive in the action of sucking hor yet nature gave the different instincts to both for those reasons cleo without doubt but what i mean is that the reason of the thing is as much the motive of action in the one as it is in the other and i verily believe that a wild woman who had never seen or not minded the production of any young animals would have several children before she would guess at the real cause of them any more than if she had the cholick she would suspect that it proceeded from some delicious fruit she had eaten especially if she had feasted upon it for several months without perceiving any inconveniency from it children all the world over are brought forth with pain more or less which seems to have no affinity with pleasure and an untaught creature however docil and attentive would want several clear experiments before it would believe that the one could produce or be the cause of the other hor most people marry in hopes and with a design of having children cleo i doubt not and believe that there are as many that would rather not have children or at least not so fast as often they come as there are that wish for them even in the state of matrimony but out of it in the amours of thousands that revel in enjoyments   0children are reckond to be the greatest calamity that can befal them and often what criminal love gave birth to without thought more     criminal pride destroys with purposd and considerate cruelty but all this belongs to people in society that are knowing and well acquainted with the natural consequences of things what i urgd i spoke of a savage hor still the end of love between the different sexes in all animals is the preservation of their species cleo i have allowd that already but once more the savage is not prompted to love from that consideration he propagates before he knows the consequence of it and i much question whether the most civilizd pair in the most chaste of their embraces ever acted from the care of their species as a real principle a rich man may with great impatience wish for a son to inherit his name and his estate perhaps he may marry from no other motive and for no other purpose but all the satisfaction he seems to receive from the flattering prospect of an happy posterity can only arise from a pleasing reflection on himself as the cause of those descendants how much soever this mans posterity might be thought to owe him for their being it is certain that the motive he acted from was to oblige himself still heres a wishing for posterity    a thought and design of getting children which no wild couple could have to boast of yet they would be vain enough to look upon themselves as the principal cause of all their offspring and descendants though they should live to see the fifth or sixth generation hor i can find no vanity in that and i should think em so myself cleo yet as free agents it would be plain that they had contributed nothing to the existence of their posterity hor now surely you have overshot the mark nothing cleo no nothing even to that of their own children knowingly if youll allow that men have     their appetites from nature there is but one real cause in the universe to produce that infinite variety of stupendious effects and all the mighty labours that are performd in nature either within or far beyond the reach of our senses parents are the efficients of their offspring with no more truth or propriety of speech than the tools of an artificer that were made and contrivd by himself are the cause of the most elaborate of his works the senseless engine that raises water into the copper and the passive mashtub  have between them as great a share in the art and action of brewing as the liveliest male and female ever had in the production of an animal     hor you make stocks and stones of us is it not in our choice to act or not to act cleo yes it is in my choice now either to run my head against the wall or to let it alone but i hope it does not puzzle you much to guess which of the two i shall chuse hor but dont we move our bodies as we list and is not every action determind by the will cleo what signifies that where there is a passion that manifestly sways and with a strict hand governs that will hor still we act with consciousness and are intelligent creatures cleo not in the affair i speak of where willing or not willing we are violently urgd from within and in a manner compelld not only to assist in but likewise to long for and in spight of our teeth be highly pleased with a performance that infinitely surpasses our understanding the comparison i made is just in every part of it for the most loving and if you will the most sagacious couple you can conceive are as ignorant in the mystery of generation nay must remain after having had twenty children   0 together as much uninformd and as little conscious of natures transactions and what has been wrought within them as inanimate utensils are of the most mystick and most ingenious operations they have been employd in     hor i dont know any man more expert in tracing human pride or more severe in humbling it than yourself but when the subject comes in your way you dont know how to leave it i wish you would at once go over to the origin of society which how to derive or bring about at all from the savage family as we left it is past my skill it is impossible but those children when they grew up would quarrel on innumerable occasions if men had but three appetites to gratify that are the most obvious they could never live together in peace without government for though they all paid a deference to the father yet if he was a man void of all prudence that could give them no good rules to walk by i am persuaded that they would live in a perpetual state of war and the more numerous his offspring grew the more the old savage would be puzzled between his desire and incapacity of government as they encreased in numbers they would be forced to extend their limits and the spot they were born upon would not hold them long no body would be willing to leave his native vale especially if it was a fruitful one the more i think upon it and the more i look into such multitudes the less i can conceive which way they could ever be formd into a society     cleo the first thing that could make man associate would be common danger which unites the greatest enemies this danger they would certainly be in from wild beasts considering that no uninhabited country is without them and the defenceless condition in which men come into the world this often must have been a cruel article to prevent the increase of our species     hor the supposition then that this wild man with his progeny should for fifty years live undisturbed is not very probable and i need not trouble myself about our savages being embarrassd with too numerous an offspring cleo you say right there is no probability that a man and his progeny all unarmd should so long escape the ravenous hunger of beasts of prey that are to live upon what animals they can get that leave no place unsearchd nor pains untryd to come at food though with the hazard of their lives the reason why i made that supposition was to shew you first the improbability that a wild and altogether untaught man should have the knowledge and discretion which sir william temple gives him   secondly that children who conversd with their own species though they were brought up by savages would be governable and consequently that all such when come to maturity would be fit for society how    ignorant and unskillful soever their parents might have been hor i thank you for it for it has shewn me that the very first generation of the most brutish savages was sufficient to produce sociable creatures but that to produce a man fit to govern others much more was required cleo i return to my conjecture concerning the first motive that would make savages associate it is not possible to know any thing with certainty of beginnings where men were destitute of letters but i think that the nature of the thing makes it highly probable that it must have been their common danger from beasts of prey as well such sly ones as lay in wait for their children and the defenceless animals men made use of for themselves as the more bold that would openly attack grown men and women what much confirms me in this opinion is     the general agreement of all the relations we have from the most ancient times in different countries for in the infancy of all nations prophane history is stuffd with the accounts of the conflicts men had with wild beasts it took up the chief labours of the heroes of remotest antiquity and their greatest prowess was shewn in killing of dragons and subduing of other monsters     hor do you lay any stress upon sphinxes basilisks flying dragons and bulls that spit fire cleo as much as i do on modern witches but i believe that all those fictions had their rise from noxious beasts the mischiefs they did and other realities that struck terrour into man and i believe that if no man had ever been seen on a horses back we should never have heard of centaurs the prodigious force and rage that are apparent in some savage animals and the astonishing power which from the various poysons of venemous creatures we are sure must be hid in others the sudden and unexpected assaults of serpents the variety of them the vast bulks of crocodiles the irregular and uncommon shapes of some fishes and the wings of others are all things that are capable of alarming mans fear and it is incredible what chimeras that passion alone may produce in a terrifyd mind the dangers of the day often haunt men at night with addition of terror and from what they remember in their dreams it is easy to forge realities if you will consider likewise that the natural ignorance of man and his hankering after knowledge will augment the credulity which hope and fear first give birth to the desire the generality have of applause and the great esteem that is commonly a had for the merveilleux and the wit   nesses and relaters of it if i say you will consider all these you will easily discover how many creatures came to be talkd of describd and formally painted that never had any existence     hor i dont wonder at the origin of monstrous figures or the invention of any fables whatever but in the reason you gave for the first motive that would make men combine in one interest i find something very perplexing which i own i never thought of before when i reflect on the condition of man as you have set it before me naked and defenceless and the multitude of ravenous animals that thirst after his blood and are superior to him in strength and completely armd by nature it is inconceivable to me how our species should have subsisted cleo what you observe is well worthy our attention hor it is astonishing what filthy abominable beasts are lions and tygers cleo i think them to be very fine creatures there is nothing i admire more than a lion hor we have strange accounts of his generosity and gratitude but do you believe them cleo i dont trouble my head about them what i admire is his fabrick his structure and his rage so justly proportiond to one    another there are order symmetry and superlative wisdom to be observd in all the works of nature but she has not a machine of which every part more visibly answers the end for which the whole was formd hor the destruction of other animals cleo thats true but how conspicuous is that end without mystery or uncertainty that grapes were made for wine and man for society are truths not accomplishd in every individual but there is a real majesty stampd on every single lion at the sight of which the stoutest animals submit and tremble when we look upon and examine his massy talons the size of them and the labourd firmness with which they are fixd in and fastend to that prodigious paw his dreadful teeth the strength of his     jaws and the width of his mouth equally terrible the use of them is obvious but when we consider moreover the make of his limbs the toughness of his flesh and tendons the solidity of his bones beyond that of other animals and the whole frame of him together with his neverceasing anger speed and agility whilst in the desart he ranges king of beasts when i say we consider all these things it is stupidity not to see the design of nature and with what amazing skill the beautiful creature is contrived for offensive war and conquest      hor you are a good painter but after all why would you judge of a creatures nature from what it was perverted to rather than from its original the state it was first produced in the lion in paradise was a gentle loving creature hear what milton says of his behaviour before adam and eve as they sate recline on the soft downy bank damaskd with flowers   —— —— about them frisking playd   all beasts of the earth since wild and of all chace   in wood or wilderness forest or den   sporting the lion rampd and in his paw   dandld the kid bears tygres ounces pards   gambold before them—— —— ——  what was it the lion fed upon what sustenance had all these beasts of prey in paradise cleo i dont know no body who believes the bible doubts but that the whole state of paradise and the intercoursea between god and the first man were as much preternatural as the creation out of nothing and therefore it cannot be supposd that they should be accounted for by human reason and if they were moses would not be answerable for more than he advanced himself the history which he has     given us of those times   0is extremely succinct and ought not to be charged with any thing containd in the glosses and paraphrases that have been made upon it by others hor milton has said nothing of paradise but what he could justify from moses cleo it is no where to be proved from moses that the state of innocence lasted so long that goats or any viviparous animals could have bred and brought forth young ones hor you mean that there could have been no kid i should never have made that cavil in so fine a poem it was not in my thoughts what i aimd at in repeating those lines was to shew you how superfluous and impertinent a lion must have been in paradise and that those who pretend to find fault with the works of nature might have censurd her with justice for lavishing and throwing away so many excellencies upon a great beast to no purpose what a fine variety of destructive weapons would they say what prodigious strength of limbs and sinews are here given to a creature what to do with to be quiet and dandle a kid i own that to me this province the employment assignd to the lion seems to be as proper and well chosen as if youd make a nurse of alexander the great cleo you might make as many flights upon a lion now if you saw him asleep no    body would think that a bull had occasion for horns who had never seen him otherwise than quietly grazing among a parcel of cows but if one should see him attackd by dogs by a wolf or a rival of his own species he would soon find out that his horns were of great use and service to him the lion was not made to be always in paradise hor there i would have you if the lion was contrivd for purposes to be servd and executed out of paradice then it is manifest from the very creation     that the fall of man was determind and predestinated cleo foreknown it was nothing could be hid from omniscience that is certain but that it was predestinated so as to have prejudiced or any ways influenced the freewill of adam i utterly deny but that word predestinated has made so much noise in the world and the thing itself has been the cause of so many fatal quarrels and is so inexplicable that i am resolved never to engage in any dispute concerning it  hor i cant make you but what you have extolld so much must have cost the lives of thousands of our species and it is a wonder to me how men when they were but few could possibly defend themselves before they had fire arms or at least bows and arrows for what number of naked men and women would be a match for one couple of lions     cleo yet here we are and none of those animals are sufferd to be wild in any civilizd nation our superior understanding has got the start of them hor my reason tells me it must be that but i cant help observing that when human understanding serves your purpose to solve any thing it is always ready and full grown but at other times knowledge and reasoning are the work of time and men are not capable of thinking justly till after many generations pray before men had arms what could their     understanding do against lions and what hindred wild beasts from devouring mankind as soon as they were born cleo providence  hor daniel indeed was savd by miracle but what is that to the rest of mankind great numbers we know have at different times been torn to pieces by savage beasts what i want to know is the reason that any of them escapd and the whole species was not destroyd by them when men had yet no weapons to defend nor strong holds to shelter themselves from the fury of those merciless creatures cleo i have named it to you already providence hor but which way can you prove this miraculous assistance     cleo you still talk of miracles and i speak of providence or the allgoverning wisdom of god hor if you can demonstrate to me how that wisdom interposd between our species and that of lions in the beginning of the world without miracle any more than it does at present eris mihi magnus apollo   for now i am sure a wild lion would prey upon a naked man as soon at least as he would upon an ox or an horse cleo wont you allow me that all properties instincts and what we call the nature of things animate or inanimate are the produce the effects of that wisdom hor i never thought otherwise     cleo then it will not be difficult to prove this to you lions are never brought forth wild but in very hot countries as bears are the product of the cold but the generality of our species which loves moderate warmth are most delighted with the middle regions men may against their wills be inured to intense cold or by use and patience accustom themselves to excessive heat but a mild air and weather between both extremes being more agreeable to human bodies the greatest part of mankind would naturally settle in temperate climates and with the same conveniency as to every thing else never chuse any other this would very much lessen the    danger men would be in from the fiercest and most irresistible wild beasts hor but would lions and tygers in hot countries keep so close within their bounds and bears in cold ones as never to straggle or stray beyond them cleo i dont suppose they would and men as well as cattle have often been pickd up by lions far from the places where these were whelpd no wild beasts are more fatal to our species than often we are to one another and men pursued by their enemies have fled into climates and countries which they would never have chose avarice likewise and curiosity have without force or necessity often exposed men to dangers which they might have avoided if they had been satisfied with what nature required and labourd for selfpreservation in that simple manner which creatures less vain and fantastical content themselves with in all these cases i dont question but multitudes of our species have sufferd from savage beasts and other noxious animals and on their account only i verily believe it would have been impossible for any number of men to have settled or subsisted in either very hot or very cold countries before the invention of bows and arrows or better arms but all this does nothing to overthrow my     assertion what i wanted to prove is that all creatures chusing by instinct that degree of heat or cold    which is most natural to them there would be room enough in the world for man to multiply his species for many ages without running almost any risque of being devourd either by lions or by bears and that the most savage man would find this out without the help of his reason this i call the work of providence by which i mean the unalterable wisdom of the supreme being in the harmonious disposition of the universe the fountain of that incomprehensible chain of causes on which all events have their undoubted dependance hor you have made this out better than i had expected but i am afraid that what you alledged as the first motive toward society is come to nothing by it cleo dont fear that there are other savage beasts against which men could not guard themselves unarmd without joyning and mutual assistance in temperate climates most uncultivated countries abound with wolves hor i have seen them in germany they are of the size of a large mastiff but i thought their chief prey had been sheep cleo any thing they can conquer is their prey they are desperate creatures and will fall upon men cows and horses as well as upon sheep when they are very hungry they have teeth like mastiffs but besides them they have sharp claws to tear with    which dogs have not the stoutest man is hardly equal to them in strength but what is worse they often come in troops and whole villages have been attackd by them they have five six and more whelps at a litter and would soon overrun a country where they breed if men did not combine against and make it their business to destroy them wild boars likewise are terrible creatures that few large   0 forests and uninhabited places in temperate climates are free from hor those tusks of theirs are dreadful weapons cleo and they are much superiour to wolves in bulk and strength history is full of the mischief they have done in ancient times and of the renown that valiant men have gaind by conquering them hor thats true but those heroes that fought monsters in former days were well armd at least the generality of them but what could a number of naked men before they had any arms at all have to oppose to the teeth and claws of ravenous wolves that came in troops and what impression could the greatest blow a man can strike make upon the thick bristly hide of a wild boar cleo as on the one hand i have named every thing that man has to fear from wild beasts so on the other we ought not to for   get the things that are in his favour in the first place a wild man inured to hardship would far exceed a tame one in all feats of strength nimbleness and activity in the second his anger would sooner and more usefully transport and assist him in his savage state than it can do in society where from his infancy he is so many ways taught and forced in his own defence to cramp and stifle with his fears the noble gift of nature in wild creatures we see that most of them when their own life or that of their young ones is at stake fight with great obstinacy and continue fighting to the last and do what mischief they can whilst they have breath without regard to their being overmatchd or the disadvantages they labour under it is observd likewise that the more untaught and inconsiderate creatures are the more entirely they are swayd by the passion that is uppermost natural affection would make wild men and women too sacrifice their lives and die for their children but they would die fighting and one wolf would     not find it an easy matter to carry off a child from his watchful parents if they were both resolute though they were naked as to mans being born defenceless it is not to be conceivd that he should long know the strength of his arms without being acquainted with the articulation of his fingers or at least what is owing to it his faculty    of grasping and holding fast and the most untaught savage would make use of clubs and staves before he came to maturity as the danger men are in from wild beasts would be of the highest consequence so it would employ their utmost care and industry they would dig holes and invent other stratagems to distress their enemies and destroy their young ones as soon as they found out fire they would make use of that element to guard themselves and annoy their foes by the help of it they would soon learn to sharpen wood which presently would put em upon making spears and other weapons that would cut when men are angry enough with creatures to strike them and these are running away or flying from them they are apt to throw at what they cannot reach this as soon as they had spears would naturally lead them to the invention of darts and javelins here perhaps they might stop a while but the same chain of thinking would in time produce bows and arrows the elasticity of sticks and boughs of trees is very obvious and to make strings of the guts of animals i dare say is more ancient than the use of hemp experience teaches us that men may have all these and many more weapons and be very expert in the use of them before any manner of government except that of parents over their children is to be seen    among them it is likewise very well known that savages furnishd with no better arms when they are strong enough in number will venture to attack and even hunt after the fiercest wild beasts lions and tygers     not excepted another thing is to be considerd that likewise favours our species and relates to the nature of the creatures of which in temperate climates man has reason to stand in bodily fear of hor wolves and wild boars cleo yes that great numbers of our species have been devourd by the first is uncontested but they most naturally go in quest of sheep and poultry and as long as they can get carrion or any thing to fill their bellies with they seldom hunt after men or other large animals which is the reason that in the summer our species as to personal insults have not much to fear from them it is certain likewise that savage swine will hunt after men and many of their maws have been crammd with human flesh but they naturally feed on acorns chesnuts beachmast and other vegetables and they are only carnivorous upon occasion and through necessity when they can get nothing else in great frosts when the country is bare and every thing coverd with snow it is evident then that human creatures are not in any great and immediate danger from either of these species of beasts but in hard winters which   0happen but seldom in temperate climates but as they are our perpetual enemies by spoiling and devouring every thing that may serve for the sustenance of man it is highly necessary that we should not only be always upon our guard against them but likewise never cease to assist one another in routing and destroying them hor i plainly see that mankind might subsist and survive to multiply and get the mastery over all other creatures that should oppose them and as this could never have been brought about unless men had assisted one another against savage beasts it is possible that the necessity men were in of joyning and uniting together was the first step toward society thus far i am willing to allow you to have proved your main     point but to ascribe all this to providence otherwise than that nothing is done without the divine permission seems inconsistent with the ideas we have of a perfectly good and merciful being it is possible that all poysonous animals may have something in them thats beneficial to men and i wont dispute with you whether the most venomous of all the serpents which lucan has made mention of  did not contain some antidote or other fine medicine still undiscovered but when i look upon the vast variety of ravenous and bloodthirsty creatures that are not only superiour to us in strength but like   wise visibly armd by nature as it were on purpose for our destruction when i say i look upon these i can find out no use for them nor what they could be designd for unless it be to punish us but i can much less conceive that the divine wisdom should have made them the means without which men could not have been civilizd how many thousands of our species must have been devourd in the conflicts with them cleo ten troops of wolves with fifty in each would make a terrible havock in a long winter among a million of our species with their hands tied behind them but among half that number one pestilence has been known to slaughter more than so many wolves could have eaten in the same time notwithstanding the great resistance that was made against it by approvd of medicines and able physicians it is owing to the principle of pride we are born with and the high value we all for the sake of one have for our species that men imagine the whole universe to be principally made for their use and this errour makes them commit a thousand extravagancies and have pitiful and most unworthy notions of god and his works it is not greater cruelty or more unnatural in a wolf to eat a piece of a man than it is in a man     to eat part of a lamb or a chicken what or how many purposes wild beasts were made for is not for us to determine but that    they were made we know and that some of them must have been very calamitous to every infant nation and settlement of men is almost as certain this you was fully persuaded of and thought moreover that they must have been such an obstacle to the very subsistence of our species as was insurmountable in answer to this difficulty which you started i shewd you from the different instincts and peculiar tendencies of animals that in nature a manifest provision was made for our species by which notwithstanding the rage and power of the fiercest beasts we should make a shift naked and defenceless to escape their fury so as to be able to maintain ourselves and multiply our kind till by our numbers and arms acquired by our own industry we could put to flight or destroy all savage beasts without exception whatever spot of the globe we might have a mind to cultivate and settle on the necessary blessings we receive from the sun are obvious to a child and it is demonstrable that without it none of the living creatures that are now upon the earth could subsist but if it were of no other use being eighta hundred thousand times bigger than the earth at least one thousandth part of it would do our business as well if it was but nearer to us in proportion from this consideration alone i am persuaded that the sun was made to enlighten and cherish other bodies besides this pla   net of ours fire and water were designd for innumerable purposes and among the uses that are made of them some are immensly different from others but whilst we receive the benefit of these and are only intent on ourselves it is highly probable that there are thousands of things and perhaps our own machines among them that in the vast system of the universe are now serving some very wise ends which we shall never know according     to that plan of this globe i mean the scheme of government in relation to the living creatures that inhabit the earth the destruction of animals is as necessary as the generation of them hor i have learnd that from the fable of the bees  and i believe what i have read there to be very true that if any one species was to be exempt from death it would in time crush all the rest to pieces tho the first were sheep and the latter all lions but that the supreme being should have introduced society at the expence of so many lives of our species i cannot believe when it might have been done much better in a milder way cleo we are speaking of what probably was done and not of what might have been done there is no question but the same power that made whales might have made us seventy feet high and given us strength in proportion but since the plan of this    globe requires and you think it necessary your self that in every species some should dye almost as fast as others are born why would you take away any of the means of dying hor are there not diseases enough physicians and apothecaries as well as wars by sea and land that may take off more than the redundancy of our species cleo they may it is true but in fact they are not always sufficient to do this and in populous nations we see that war wild beasts hanging drowning and an hundred casualties together with sickness and all its attendants are hardly a match for one invisible faculty of ours which is the instinct men have to preserve their species every thing is easy to the deity but to speak after an human manner it is evident that in forming this earth and     every thing that is in it no less wisdom or sollicitude was required in contriving the various ways and means to get rid and destroy animals than seems to have been employd in producing them and it is as demonstrable that our bodies were made on purpose not to last beyond such a period as it is that some houses are built with a design not to stand longer than such a term of years but it is death itself to which our aversion by nature is universal as to the manner of dying men differ in their opinions and i never heard of one yet that was generally liked of     hor but no body chuses a cruel one what an unspeakable and infinitely excruciating torment must it be to be torn to pieces and eat alive by a savage beast cleo not greater i can assure you than are daily occasiond by the gout in the stomach and the stone in the bladder hor which way can you give me this assurance how can you prove it cleo from our fabrick itself the frame of human bodies that cannot admit of any torment infinitely excruciating the degrees of pain as well as of pleasure in this life are limited and exactly proportiond to every ones strength whatever exceeds that takes away the senses and whoever has once fainted away with the extremity of any torture knows the full extent of what here he can suffer if he remembers what he felt the real mischief which wild beasts have done to our species and the calamities they have brought upon it are not to be compared to the cruel usage and the multiplicity of mortal injuries which men have receivd from one another set before your eyes a robust warriour that having lost a limb in battle is afterwards trampled upon by twenty horses and tell me pray whether you think that lying thus helpless with most of his ribs broke and a fracturd skull in the agony of death for several hours he suffers less than if a lion had dispatchd him     hor     they are both very bad cleo in the choice of things we are more often directed by the caprice of fashions and the custom of the age than we are by solid reason or our own understanding there is no greater comfort in dying of a dropsy and being eaten by worms than there is in being drownd at sea and becoming the prey of fishes but in our narrow way of thinking there is something that subverts and corrupts our judgment how else could persons of known elegancy in their taste prefer rotting and stinking in a loathsome sepulchre to their being burnt in the open air to inoffensive ashes hor i freely own that i have an aversion to every thing that is shocking and unnatural cleo what you call shocking i dont know but nothing is more common to nature or more agreeable to her ordinary course than that creatures should live upon one another the whole system of animated beings on the earth seems to be built upon this and there is not one species that we know of that has not another that feeds upon it either alive or dead and most kind of fish are forced to live upon fish that this in the lastmentiond was not an omission or neglect is evident from the large provision nature has made for it far exceeding any thing she has done for other animals     hor you mean the prodigious quantity of roe they spawn cleo a yes and that the eggs containd in them receive not their fecundity till after they are excluded by which means the female may be filld with as many of them as her belly can hold and the eggs themselves may be more closely crowded together than would be consistent with the admission of any substance from the male without this one fish could not bring forth yearly such a prodigious shoal     hor but might not the aura seminalis of the male be subtile enough to penetrate the whole cluster of eggs and influence every one of them without taking up any room as it does in fowls and other oviparous animals cleo the ostrich excepted in the first place in the second there are no other oviparous animals in which the eggs are so closely compacted together as they are in fish but suppose that the prolifick power should pervade the whole mass of them if all the eggs which some of the females are crammd with were to be impregnated whilst they are within the fish it is impossible but the aura seminalis the prolifick spirit of the male tho it took up no room itself would as it does in all other creatures dilate and more or less distend every egg and the least expansion of so many individuals would swell the whole roe to a bulk that would require    a much greater space than the cavity that now contains them is not here a contrivance beyond imagination fine to provide for the continuance of a species tho every individual of it should be born with an instinct to destroy it hor what you speak of is only true at sea in a considerable part of europe at least for in fresh water most kinds of fish do not feed on their own species and yet they spawn in the same manner and are as full of roe as all the rest among them the only great destroyer with us is the pike cleo and he is a very ravenous one we see in ponds that where pikes are sufferd to be no other fish shall ever encrease in number but in rivers and all waters near any land there are amphibious fowls and many sorts of them that live mostly upon fish of these waterfowls in many places there are prodigious quantities besides these there are otters beavers and many other creatures that live upon fish in brooks and shallow waters the hearn     and bittern will have their share what is taken off by them perhaps is but little but the young fry and the spawn that one pair of swans are able to consume in one year would very well serve to stock a considerable river so they are but eat it is no matter what eats them either their own species or another what i would prove is that nature produces no extraor   dinary numbers of any species but she has contrivd means answerable to destroy them the variety of insects in the several parts of the world would be incredible to any one that has not examind into this matter and the different beauties to be observd in them is infinite but neither the beauty nor the variety of em are more surprizing than the industry of nature in the multiplicity of her contrivances to kill them and if the care and vigilance of all other animals in destroying them were to cease at once in two years time the greatest part of the earth which is ours now would be theirs and in many countries insects would be the only inhabitants hor i have heard that whales live upon nothing else that must make a fine consumption cleo that is the general opinion i suppose because they never find any fish in them and because there are vast multitudes of insects in those seas hovering on the surface of the water this creature likewise helps to corroborate my assertion that in the numbers produced of every species the greatest regard is had to the consumption of them this prodigious animal being too big to be swallowd nature in it has quite alterd the oeconomy observed in all other fish for they are viviparous engender like other viviparous animals and have never above two or three   0young ones at a time for the continuance of every species among such an infinite variety of creatures as this globe yields it was highly necessary that the provision for their destruction   0 should not be less ample than that which was made for the generation of them and therefore the sollicitude of nature in procuring death and the consumption of animals is visibly superiour to the care she takes to feed and preserve them hor prove that pray cleo millions of her creatures are starvd every year and doomd to perish for want of sustenance but whenever any dye there is always plenty of mouths to devour them but then again she gives all she has nothing is so fine or elaborate as that she grudges it for food nor is any thing more extensive or impartial than her bounty she thinks nothing too good for the meanest of her broods and all creatures are equally welcome to every thing they can find to eat how curious is the workmanship in the structure of a common fly how inimitable are the celerity of his wings and the quickness of all his motions in hot weather should a pythagorean that was likewise a good master in mechanicks by the help of a microscope pry into every minute part of this changeable creature and duly consider the elegancy of its machinery would he not think it great pity that thousands of millions of animated beings so    nicely wrought and admirably finishd should every day be devourd by little birds and spiders of which we stand in so little need nay dont you think yourself that things would have been managed full as well if the quantity of flies had been less and there had been no spiders at all hor i remember the fable of the acorn and the pumpkin  too well to answer you i dont trouble my head about it     cleo yet you found fault with the means which i supposed providence had made use of to make men associate i mean the common danger they were in from wild beasts tho you ownd the probability of its having been the first motive of their uniting hor i cannot believe that providence should have no greater regard to our species than it has to flies and the spawn of fish or that nature has ever sported with the fate of human creatures as she does with the lives of insects and been as wantonly lavish of the first as she seems to be of the latter i wonder how you can reconcile this to religion you that are such a stickler for christianity cleo religion has nothing to do with it but we are so full of our own species and the excellency of it that we have no leisure seriously to consider the system of this earth i mean the plan on which the oeconomy of it is built in relation to the living creatures that are in and upon it     hor i dont speak as to our species but in respect to the deity has religion nothing to do with it that you make god the author of so much cruelty and malice cleo it is impossible you should speak otherwise than in relation to our species when you make use of those expressions which can only signify to us the intentions things were done with or the sentiments human creatures have of them and nothing can be calld cruel or malicious in regard to him who did it unless his thoughts and designs were such in doing it all actions in nature abstractly considerd are equally indifferent and whatever it may be to     individual creatures to die is not a greater evil to this earth or the whole universe than it is to be born hor this is making the first cause of things not an intelligent being cleo why so can you not conceive an intelligent and even a most wise being that is not only exempt from but likewise incapable of entertaining any malice or cruelty hor such a being could not commit or order things that are malicious and cruel cleo neither does god but this will carry us into a dispute about the origin of evil and from thence we must inevitably fall on freewill and predestination which as i have told you before is an inexplicable mystery i will never meddle with but i never said nor thought any thing irreverent to the deity    on the contrary the idea i have of the supreme being is as transcendently great as my capacity is able to form one of what is incomprehensible and i could as soon believe that he could cease to exist as that he should be the author of any real evil but i should be glad to hear the method after which you think society might have been much better introduced pray acquaint me with that milder way you spoke of hor you have thoroughly convinced me that the natural love which it is pretended we have for our species is not greater than what many other animals have for theirs but if nature had actually given us an affection for one another as sincere and conspicuous as that which parents are seen to have for their children whilst they are helpless men would have joynd together by choice and nothing could have hindred them from associating whether their numbers had been great or small and themselves either ignorant or knowing cleo o mentes hominum cæcas o pectora cæca        hor you may exclaim as much as you please i am persuaded that this would have united men in firmer bonds of friendship than any common danger from wild beasts could have tied them with but what fault can you find with it and what mischief could have befaln us from mutual affection     cleo it would have been inconsistent with the scheme the plan after which it is evident providence has been pleasd to order and dispose of things in the universe if such an affection had been planted in man by instinct there never could have been any fatal quarrels among them nor mortal hatreds men could never have been cruel to one another in short there could have been no wars of any duration and no considerable numbers of our species could ever have been killd by one anothers malice hor youd make a rare statephysician in prescribing war cruelty and malice for the welfare and maintenance of civil society cleo pray dont misrepresent me i have done no such thing but if you believe the world is governd by providence at all you must believe likewise that the deity makes use of means to bring about perform and execute his will and pleasure as for example to have war kindled there must be first misunderstandings and quarrels between the subjects of different nations and dissentions among the respective princes rulers or governours of them it is evident that the mind of man is the general mint where the means of this sort must be coind from whence i conclude that if providence had orderd matters after that mild way which you think would have been the best very little of humane blood could have been spilt if any at all     hor where would have been the inconveniency of that cleo you could not have had that variety of living creatures there is now nay there would not have     been room for man himself and his sustenance our species alone would have overstockd the earth if there had been no wars and the common course of providence had not been more interrupted than it has been might i not justly say then that this is quite contrary and destructive to the scheme on which it is plain this earth was built this is a consideration which you will never give its due weight i have once already put you in mind of it that you yourself have allowd the destruction of animals to be as necessary as the generation of them there is as much wisdom to be seen in the contrivances how numbers of living creatures might always be taken off and destroyd to make room for those that continually succeed them as there is in making all the different sorts of them every one preserve their own species what do you think is the reason that there is but one way for us to come into the world hor because that one is sufficient cleo then froma a parity of reason we ought to think that there are several ways to go out of the world because one would not have been sufficient now if for the support and maintenance of that variety of crea   tures which are here that they should die is a postulatum as necessary as it is that they should be born and you cut off or obstruct the means of dying and actually stop up one of the great gates through which we see multitudes go to death do you not oppose the scheme nay do you mar it less than if you hinderd generation if there never had been war and no other means of dying besides the ordinary ones this globe could not have born or at least not maintaind the tenth part of the people that would have been in it by war i dont mean only such as one nation has had against another but civil as well as foreign quarrels general massacres private murders poyson sword and all hostile force     by which men notwithstanding their pretence of love to their species have endeavourd to take away one anothers lives throughout the world from the time that cain slew abel to this day hor i dont believe that a quarter of all these mischiefs are upon record but what may be known from history would make a prodigious number of men much greater i dare say than ever was on this earth at one time but what would you infer from this they would not have been immortal and if they had not died in war they must soon after have been slain by diseases when a man of threescore is killd by a bullet in the field it is odds that he would not have lived    four years longer tho he had stayd at home cleo there are soldiers of threescore perhaps in all armies but men generally go to the war when they are young and when four or five thousand are lost in battle youll find the greatest number to have been under five and thirty consider now that many men do not marry till after that age who get ten or a dozen children hor if all that die by the hands of another were to get a dozen children before they die —— cleo there is no occasion for that i suppose nothing that is either extravagant or improbable but that all such as have been wilfully destroyd by means of their species should have lived and taken their chance with the rest that every thing should have befaln them that has befaln those that have not been killd that way and the same likewise to their posterity and that all of them should have been subject to all the casualties as well as diseases doctors apothecaries and other accidents that take away mans life and shorten his days war and violence from one another only excepted hor but if the earth had been too full of inhabitants might not providence have sent pestilences and diseases oftener more children might have died     when they were young or more women might have proved barren     cleo i dont know whether your mild way would have been more generally pleasing but you entertain notions of the deity that are unworthy of him men might certainly have been born with the instinct you speak of but if this had been the creators pleasure there must have been another oeconomy and things on earth from the beginning would have been ordered in a manner quite different from what they are now but to make a scheme first and afterwards to mend it when it proves defective is the business of finite wisdom it belongs to human prudence alone to mend faults to correct and redress what was done amiss before and to alter the measures which experience teaches men were ill concerted but the knowledge of god was consummate from eternity infinite wisdom is not liable to errors or mistakes therefore all his works are universally good and every thing is made exactly as he would have it the firmness and stability of his laws and councils are everlasting and therefore his resolutions are as unalterable as his decrees are eternal it is not a quarter of an hour ago that you named wars among the necessary means to carry off the redundancy of our species how come you now to think them useless i can demonstrate to you that nature in the production of our species has amply provided against the losses of our sex occasioned by wars by repairing them visi   bly where they are sustained in as palpable a manner as she has provided for the great destruction that is made of fish by their devouring one another hor how is that pray cleo by sending more males into the world than females you will easily allow me that our sex bears the brunt of all the toils and hazards that are undergone by sea and land and that by this means a far     greater number of men must be destroyd than there is of women now if we see as certainly we do that of the infants yearly born the number of males is always considerably superior to that of the females is it not manifest that nature has made a provision for great multitudes which if they were not destroyd would be not only superfluous but of pernicious consequence in great nations hor that superiority in the number of males born is wonderful indeed i remember the account that has been publishd concerning it as it was taken from the bills of births and burials in the city and suburbs  cleo for fourscore years  in which the number of females born was constantly much inferior to that of the males sometimes by many hundreds and that this provision of nature to supply the havock that is made of men by wars and navigation is still greater than could be imagind from that difference only will soon appear if we consider that  00women in the first place are liable to all diseases within a trifle that are incident to men and that in the second they are subject to many disorders and calamities on account of their sex which great numbers die of and which men are wholly exempt from hor this could not well be the effect of chance     but it spoils the consequence which you drew from my affectionate scheme in case there had been no wars for your fear that our species would have encreased beyond all bounds was entirely built upon the supposition that those who have died in war should not have wanted women if they had lived which from this superiority in the number of males it is evident they should and must have wanted cleo what you observe is true but my chief aim was to shew you how disagreeable the alteration you required would have been every way to the rest of the scheme by which it is manifest things are governd at present for if the provision had been made on the other side and nature in the production of our species had continually taken care to repair the loss of women that die of calamities not incident to men then certainly there would have been women for all the men that have been destroyd by their own species if they had lived and the earth without war as i have said would have been overstocked or if nature had ever been  0 the same as she is now that is if more males had been born than females and more females had died of diseases than males the world would constantly have had a great superfluity of men if there never had been any wars and this disproportion between their number and that of the women would have caused innumerable mischiefs that are now prevented by no other natural causes than the small value men set upon their species and their dissentions with one another hor i can see no other mischief this would produce than that the number of males which die without having ever tried matrimony would be greater than it is now and whether that would be a real evil or not is a very disputable point cleo dont you think that this perpetual scarcity of women and superfluity of men would make great uneasiness in all societies how well soever people might love one another and that the value the     price of women would be so inhanced by it that none but men in tolerable good circumstances would be able to purchase them this alone would make us another world and mankind could never have known that most necessary and now inexhaustible spring from which all nations where slaves are not allowd of are constantly supplyd with willing hands for all the drudgery of hard and dirty labour i mean the children of the poor the great 0 est and most extensive of all temporal blessings that accrue from society on which all the comforts of life in the civilisd state have their unavoidable dependance  there are many other things from which it is plain that such a real love of man for his species would have been altogether inconsistent with the present scheme the world must have been destitute of all that industry that is owing to envy and emulation no society could have been easy with being a flourishing people at the expence of their neighbours or enduring to be counted a formidable nation all men would have been levellers government would have been unnecessary and there could have been no great bustle in the world look into the men of greatest renown and the most celebrated atchievements of antiquity and every thing that has been cried up and admired in past ages by the fashionable part of mankind if the same labours were to be performd over again which qualification which help of nature do you think would be the most proper means to have them executed that instinct of real affection you required without ambition or the love of glory or a stanch principle of pride and selfishness acting under pretence to and assuming the resemblance of that affection consider i beseech you that no men governed by this instinct would require services of any of their species which  0 they would not be ready to perform for others and you will easily see that its being universal would quite alter the scene of society   0 from what it is now such an instinct might be very suitable to another scheme different from this in another world where instead of fickleness and a restless desire after changes and novelty there was observd an universal steadiness continually preservd by a serene spirit of contentment among other creatures of different appetites from ours that had frugality without avarice and generosity without pride and whose sollicitude after happiness in a future state was as active and apparent in life as our pursuits are after the enjoyments of this present but as to the world we live in examine into the various ways of earthly greatness and all the engines that are made use of to attain to the felicity of carnal men and youll find that the instinct you speak of must have destroyd the principles and prevented the very existence of that pomp and glory to which human societies have been and are still raised by worldly wisdom hor i give up my affectionate scheme you have convinced me that there could not have been that stir and variety nor upon the whole that beauty in the world which there have been if all men had been naturally humble good and virtuous i believe  0 that wars of all sorts as well as diseases are natural means to hinder mankind from encreasing too fast but that wild beasts should likewise have been designd to thin our species i cannot conceive for they can only serve this end when men are but few and their numbers should be encreasd instead of lessend and afterwards if they were made for that purpose when men are strong enough they would not answer it cleo i never said that wild beasts were designd to thin our species i have shewd that many things were made to serve a variety of different purposes that in the scheme of this earth many things must have been considerd that man has nothing to do with and that it is ridiculous to think that the     universe was made for our sake i have said likewise that as all our knowledge comes à posteriori it is imprudent to reason otherwise than from facts that there are wild beasts and that there are savage men is certain and that where there are but few of the latter the first must always be very troublesome and often fatal to them is as certain and when i reflect on the passions all men are born with and their incapacity whilst they are untaught i can find no cause or motive which is so likely to unite them together and make them espouse the same interest as that common danger they must always be in from  0 wild beasts in uncultivated countries whilst they live in small families that all shift for themselves without government or dependance upon one another this first step to society i believe to be an effect which that same cause the common danger so often mentioned will never fail to produce upon our species in such circumstances what other and how many purposes wild beasts might have been designd for besides i dont pretend to determine as i have told you before hor but whatever other purposes wild beasts were designd for it still follows from your opinion that the uniting of savages in common defence must have been one which to me seems clashing with our idea of the divine goodness cleo so will every thing seem to do which we call natural evil if you ascribe human passions to the deity and measure infinite wisdom by the standard of our most shallow capacity  you have been at this twice already i thought i had answerd it i would not make god the author of evil any more than yourself but i am likewise persuaded that nothing could come by chance in respect to the supreme being and therefore unless you imagine the world not to be governd by providence you must believe that     wars and all the calamities we can suffer from man or beast as well as plagues and all other dis 0 eases are under a wise direction that is unfathomable as there can be no effect without a cause so nothing can be said to happen by chance but in respect to him who is ignorant of the cause of it i can make this evident to you in an obvious and familiar example to a man who knows nothing of the tenniscourt the skips and rebounds of the ball seem to be all fortuitous as he is not able to guess at the several different directions it will receive before it comes to the ground so as soon as it has hit the place to which it was plainly directed at first it is chance to him where it will fall whereas the experienced player knowing perfectly well the journey the ball will make goes directly to the place if he is not there already where it will certainly come within his reach nothing seems to be more the effect of chance than a cast of the dice yet they obey the laws of gravity and motion in general as much as any thing else and from the impressions that are given them it is impossible they should fall otherwise than they do but the various directions which they shall receive in the whole course of the throw being entirely unknown and the rapidity with which they change their situation being such that our slow apprehension cannot trace them what the cast will be is a mystery to human understanding at fair play but if the same variety of directions was  0 given to two cubes of ten feet each which a pair of dice receive as well from one another as the box the casters fingers that cover it and the table they are flung upon from the time they are taken up till they lye still the same effect would follow and if the quantity of motion the force that is imparted to the box and dice was exactly known and the motion itself was so much retarded in the performance that what is done in three or four seconds should take up an hours time     it would be easy to find out the reason of every throw and men might learn with certainty to foretell which side of the cube would be uppermost it is evident then that the words fortuitous and casual have no other meaning than what depends upon our want of knowledge foresight and penetration the reflection on which will shew us by what an infinity of degrees all human capacity falls short of that universal intuitus with which the supreme being beholds at once every thing without exception whether to us it be visible or invisible past present or to come hor i yield you have solved every difficulty i have been able to raise and i must confess that your supposition concerning the first motive that would make savages associate is neither clashing with good sense nor any idea we ought to have of the divine attributes but on the contrary in answering my  0 objections you have demonstrated the probability of your conjecture and rendred the wisdom and power of providence in the scheme of this earth both as to the contrivance and the execution of it more conspicuous and palpable to me than any thing i ever heard or read had done before cleo i am glad you are satisfied tho far from arrogating to my self so much merit as your civility would compliment me with hor it is very clear to me now that as it is appointed for all men to die so it is necessary there should be means to compass this end that from the number of those means or causes of death it is impossible to exclude either the malice of men or the rage of wild beasts and all noxious animals and that if they had been actually designd by nature and contrivd for that purpose we should have no more reason justly to complain of them than we have to find fault with death itself or that frightful train of diseases which are daily and hourly the manifest occasion of it     cleo they are all equally included in the curse which after the fall was deservedly pronouncd against the whole earth and if they be real evils they are to be lookd upon as the consequence of sin and a condign punishment which the transgression of our first parents has drawn and entaild upon all their posterity i am fully persuaded that  0 all the nations in the world and every individual of our species civilisd or savage had their origin from seth  cham  or japhet and as experience has taught us that the greatest empires have their periods and the best governd states and kingdoms may come to ruin so it is certain that the politest people by being scatterd and distressd may soon degenerate and some of them by accidents and misfortunes from knowing and well taught ancestors be reduced at last to savages of the first and lowest class  hor if what you are fully persuaded of be true the other is selfevident from the savages that are still subsisting cleo you once seemd to insinuate that all the danger men were in from wild beasts would entirely cease as soon as they were civilizd and lived in large and wellordered societies but by this you may see that our species will never be wholly exempt from that danger because mankind will always be liable to be reduced to savages for as this calamity has actually befallen vast multitudes that were the undoubted descendants of noah so the greatest prince upon earth that has children cannot be sure that the same disaster will never happen to any of his posterity wild beasts may be entirely extirpated in some countries that are duly cultivated but they will multiply in others that are wholly neglected and great numbers of them range   0now and are     masters in many places where they hada been routed and kept out before i shall always believe that every species of living creatures in and upon this globe without exception continues to be as it was at first under the care of that same providence that thought fit to produce it you have had a great deal of patience but i would not tire it this first step towards society now we have masterd it is a good restingplace and so well leave off for today hor with all my heart i have made you talk a great deal but i long to hear the rest as soon as you are at leisure cleo i am obliged to dine at windsor tomorrow if you are not otherwise engaged i can carry you where the honour of your company will be highly esteemd my coach shall be ready at nine you know you are in my way hor a fine opportunity indeed of three or four hours chat cleo i shall be all alone without you hor i am your man and shall expect you cleo adieu     the sixth dialogue    the sixth dialogue between horatio and cleomenes h o r a t i o now we are off the stones  pray let us lose no time i expect a great deal of pleasure from what i am to hear further cleo the second step to society is the danger men are in from one another for which we are beholden to that stanch principle of pride and ambition that all men are born with different families may endeavour to live together and be ready to join in common danger but they are all of little use to one another when there is no     common enemy to oppose if we consider that strength agility and courage would in such a state be the most valuable qualifications and that many families could not live long    together but some actuated by the principle i named would strive for superiority this must breed quarrels in which the most weak and fearful will for their own safety always join with him of whom they have the best opinion hor this would naturally divide multitudes into bands and companies that would all have their different leaders and of which the strongest and most valiant would always swallow up the weakest and most fearful cleo what you say agrees exactly with the accounts we have of the uncivilizd nations that are still subsisting in the world and thus men may live miserably many ages hor the very first generation that was brought up under the tuition of parents would be governable and would not every succeeding generation grow wiser than the foregoing cleo without doubt they would encrease in knowledge and cunning time and experience would have the same effect upon them as it has upon others and in the particular things to which they applyd themselves they would become as expert and ingenious as the most civilizd nations but their unruly passions and the discords occasioned by them would never suffer them to be happy their mutual contentions would be continually spoiling their improvements destroying their inventions and frustrating their designs     hor but would not their sufferings in time bring them acquainted with the causes of their disagreement and would not that knowledge put them upon making of contracts not to injure one another cleo very probably they would but among such illbred and uncultivated people no man would keep     a contract longer than that interest lasted which made him submit to it hor but might not religion the fear of an invisible cause be made serviceable to them as to the keeping of their contracts cleo it might without dispute and would before many generations passed away but religion could do no more among them than it does among civilisd nations where the divine vengeance is seldom trusted to only and oaths themselves are thought to be of little service where there is no human power to enforce the obligation and punish perjury hor but dont you think that the same ambition that made a man aspire to be a leader would make him likewise desirous of being obeyd in civil matters by the numbers he led cleo i do and moreover that notwithstanding this unsettled and precarious way communities would live in after three or four generations human nature would be lookd into and begin to be understood leaders would find out that the more strife    and discord there was amongst the people they headed the less use they could make of them this would put them upon various ways of curbing mankind they would forbid killing and striking one another the taking away by force the wives or children of others in the same community they would invent penalties and very early find out that no body ought to be a judge in his own cause and that old men generally speaking knew more than young hor when once they have prohibitions and penalties i should think all the difficulty surmounted and i wonder why you said that thus they might live miserably for many ages cleo there is one thing of great moment which has not been named yet and till that comes to pass no considerable numbers can ever be made happy what signify the strongest contracts when we have     nothing to shew for them and what dependance can we have upon oral tradition in matters that require exactness especially whilst the language that is spoken is yet very imperfect verbal reports are liable to a thousand cavils and disputes that are prevented by records which every body knows to be unerring witnesses and from the many attempts that are made to wrest and distort the sense of even written laws we may judge how impracticable the administration of justice must be    among all societies that are destitute of them therefore the third and last step to society is the invention of letters no multitudes can live peaceably without government no government can subsist without laws and no laws can be effectual long unless they are wrote down the consideration of this is alone sufficient to give us a great insight into the nature of man hor i dont think so the reason why no government can subsist without laws is because there are bad men in all multitudes but to take patterns from them when we would judge of human nature rather than from the good ones that follow the dictates of their reason is an injustice one would not be guilty of to brute beasts and it would be very wrong in us for a few vicious horses to condemn the whole species as such without taking notice of the many finespirited creatures that are naturally tame and gentle cleo at this rate i must repeat every thing that i have said yesterday and the day before i thought you was convinced that it was with thought as it is with speech and that tho man was born with a capacity beyond other animals to attain to both yet whilst he remaind untaught and never conversed with any of his species these characteristicks were of little use to him all men uninstructed whilst they are let alone will follow the impulse of their nature without regard to o   thers and therefore all of them are bad that are not taught to be good   0 so all horses are ungovernable that are not well broken for what we call vicious in them is when they bite or kick endeavour to break their halter throw their rider and exert themselves with all their strength to shake off the yoke and recover that liberty which nature prompts them to assert and desire what you call natural is evidently artificial and belongs to education no finespirited horse was ever tame or gentle without management some perhaps are not backd till they are four years old but then long before that time they are handled spoke to and dressd they are fed by their keepers put under restraint sometimes caressd and sometimes made to smart and nothing is omitted whilst they are young to inspire them with awe and veneration to our species and make them not only submit to it but likewise take a pride in obeying the superior genius of man but would you judge of the nature of horses in general as to its fitness to be governd take the foals of the bestbred mares and finest stallions and turn an hundred of them loose fillys and colts together in a large forest till they are seven years old and then see how tractable they will be hor but this is never done cleo whose fault is that it is not at the request of the horses that they are kept    from the mares and that any of them are ever gentle or tame is entirely owing to the management of man vice proceeds from the same origin in men as it does in horses the desire of uncontrould liberty and impatience of restraint are not more visible in the one than they are in the other and a man is then calld vicious when breaking the curba of precepts and prohibitions he wildly follows the unbridled appetites of his untaught or illmanaged nature the complaints against this nature of ours are every where the same man would have every thing he     likes without considering whether he has any right to it or not and he would do every thing he has a mind to do without regard to the consequence it would be of to others at the same time that he dislikes every body that acting from the same principle have in all their behaviour not a special regard to him hor that is in short man naturally will not do as he would be done by cleo thats true and for this there is another reason in his nature all men are partial in their judgments when they compare themselves to others no two equals think so well of each other as both do of themselves and where all men have an equal right to judge there needs no greater cause of quarrel than a present amongst them with an inscription of detur digniori man in his anger    behaves himself in the same manner as other animals disturbing in the pursuit of selfpreservation those they are angry with and all of them endeavour according as the degree of their passion is either to destroy or cause pain and displeasure to their adversaries that these obstacles to society are the faults or rather properties of our nature we may know by this that all regulations and prohibitions that have been contrivd for the temporal happiness of mankind are made exactly to tally with them and to obviate those complaints which i said were every where made against mankind the principal laws of all countries have the same tendency and there is not one that does not point at some frailty defect or unfitness for society that men are naturally subject to but all of them are plainly designd as so many remedies to cure and disappoint that natural instinct of sovereignty which teaches man to look upon every thing as centring in himself and prompts him to put in a claim to every thing he can lay his hands on this tendency and design to mend our nature for the temporal good of society is no where more visible     than in that compendious as well as complete body of laws that was given by god himself  the israelites whilst they were slaves in ægypt were governd by the laws of their masters and as they were many degrees removd from the lowest sa   vages so they were yet far from being a civilizd nation it is reasonable to think that before they receivd the law of god they had regulations and agreements already establishd which the ten commandments did not abolish and that they must have had notions of right and wrong and contracts among them against open violence and the invasion of property is demonstrable hor how is that demonstrable cleo from the decalogue itself all wise laws are adapted to the people that are to obey them from the ninth commandment for example it is evident that a mans own testimony was not sufficient to be believd in his own affair and that no body was allowd to be a judge in his own case hor it only forbids us to bear false witness against our neighbour cleo thats true and therefore the whole tenor and design of this commandment presupposes and must imply what i say but the prohibitions of stealing adultery and coveting any thing that belongd to their neighbours are still more plainly intimating the same and seem to be additions and amendments to supply the defects of some known regulations and contracts that had been agreed upon before if in this view we behold the three commandments last hinted at we shall find them to be strong evidences not only of that instinct of sovereignty with  0in us which at other times i have called a domineering spirit and a principle of selfishness but likewise of     the difficulty there is to destroy eradicate and pull it out of the heart of man for from the eighth commandment it appears that tho we debar ourselves from taking the things of our neighbour by force yet there is danger that this instinct will prompt us to get them unknown to him in a clandestine manner and deceive us with the insinuations of an oportet habere from the foregoing precept it is likewise manifest that tho we agree not to take away and rob a man of the woman that is his own it is yet to be feard that if we like her this innate principle that bids us gratify every appetite will advise us to make use of her as if she was our own tho our neighbour is at the charge of maintaining her and all the children she brings forth the last more especially is very ample in confirming my assertion it strikes directly at the root of the evil and lays open the real source of the mischiefs that are apprehended in the seventh and the eighth commandment for without first actually trespassing against this no man is in danger of breaking either of the former this tenth commandment moreover insinuates very plainly in the first place that this instinct of ours is of great power and a frailty hardly to be cured in the second that there is nothing which our neighbour can    be possessd of but neglecting the consideration of justice and property we may have a desire after it for which reason it absolutely forbids us to covet any thing that is his the divine wisdom well knowing the strength of this selfish principle which obliges us continually to assume every thing to ourselves and that when once a man heartily covets a thing this instinct this principle will overrule and persuade him to leave no stone unturnd to compass his desires hor according to your way of expounding the commandments and making them tally so exactly with the frailties of our nature it should follow from     the ninth that all men are born with a strong appetite to forswear themselves which i never heard before cleo nor i neither and i confess that the rebuke there is in this smart turn of yours is very plausible but the censure how specious soever it may appear is unjust and you shall not find the consequence you hint at if you will be pleasd to distinguish between the natural appetites themselves and the various crimes which they make us commit rather than not be obeyd for tho we are born with no immediate appetite to forswear ourselves yet we are born with more than one that if never checkd may in time oblige us to forswear ourselves or do worse if it be possible and they cannot be gratifyd without it and    the commandment you mention plainly implies that by nature we are so unreasonably attachd to our interest on all emergencies that it is possible for a man to be swayd by it not only to the visible detriment of others as is manifest from the seventh and the eighth but even tho it should be against his own conscience for no body did ever knowingly bear false witness against his neighbour but he did it for some end or other this end whatever it is i call his interest the law which forbids murder had already demonstrated to us how immensely we undervalue every thing when it comes in competition with ourselves for tho our greatest dread be destruction and we know no other calamity equal to the dissolution of our being yet such unequitable judges this instinct of sovereignty is able to make us that rather than not have our will which we count our happiness we chuse to inflict this calamity on others and bring total ruin on such as we think to be obstacles to the gratification of our appetites and this men do not only for hindrances that are present or apprehended as to come but likewise for former offences and things that are past redress hor by what you said last you mean revenge i suppose     cleo i do so and the instinct of sovereignty which i assert to be in humane nature is in nothing so glaringly conspicuous as it is in    this passion which no mere man was ever born without and which even the most civilizd as well as the most learned are seldom able to conquer for whoever pretends to revenge himself must claim a right to a judicature within and an authority to punish which being destructive to the mutual peace of all multitudes are for that reason the first things that in every civil society are snatchd away out of every mans hands as dangerous tools and vested in the governing part the supreme power only hor this remark on revenge has convinced me more than any thing you have said yet that there is some such thing as a principle of sovereignty in our nature but i cannot conceive yet why the vices of private i mean particular persons should be thought to belong to the whole species cleo because every body is liable to fall into the vices that are peculiar to his species and it is with them as it is with distempers among creatures of different kinds there are many ailments that horses are subject to which are not incident to cows there is no vice but whoever commits it had within him before he was guilty of it a tendency towards it a latent cause that disposed him to it therefore all lawgivers have two main points to consider at setting out first what things will procure happiness to the society under their care secondly what passions    and properties there are in mans nature that may either promote or obstruct this happiness it is prudence to watch your fishponds against the insults of hearns and bitterns but the same precaution would be ridiculous against turkies and peacocks or any other creatures that neither love fish nor are able to catch them hor what frailty or defect is it in our nature that the two first commandments have a regard to or as you call it tally with     cleo our natural blindness and ignorance of the true deity for tho we all come into the world with an instinct toward religion that manifests it self before we come to maturity yet the fear of an invisible cause or invisible causes which all men are born with is not more universal than the uncertainty which all untaught men fluctuate in as to the nature and properties of that cause or those causes there can be no greater proof of this —— hor i want none the history of all ages is a sufficient witness cleo give me leave there can i say be no greater proof of this than the second commandment which palpably points at all the absurdities and abominations which the illguided fear of an invisible cause had already made and would still continue to make men commit and in doing this i can hardly think that any thing but divine wisdom    could in so few words have comprehended the vast extent and sum total of human extravagancies as it is done in that commandment for there is nothing so high or remote in the firmament nor so low or abject upon earth but some men have worshipd it or made it one way or other the object of their superstition hor   —— crocodilon adorat   pars hæc illa pavet saturam serpentibus ibin   effigies sacri nitet aurea cercopitheci  a holy monkey i own it is a reproach to our species that ever any part of it should have adored such a creature as a god but that is the tiptop of folly that can be charged on superstition cleo i dont think so a monkey is still a living creature and consequently somewhat superiour to things inanimate hor i should have thought mens adoration of the sun or moon infinitely less absurd than to have seen them fall down before so vile so ridiculous an animal     cleo those who have adored the sun and moon never questiond but they were intelligent as well as glorious beings but when i mentioned the word inanimate i was thinking on what the same poet you quoted said of the veneration men paid to leeks and    onions deities they raised in their own gardens   porrum  cepe nefas violare  frangere morsu   o sanctas genteis quibus hæc nascuntur in hortis   numina—— —— ——   but this is nothing to what has been done in america fourteen hundred years after the time of juvenal if the portentous worship of the mexicans had been known in his days he would not have thought it worth his while to take notice of the ægyptians i have often admired at the uncommon pains those poor people must have taken to express the frightful and shocking as well as bizarre and unutterable notions they entertaind of the superlative malice and hellish implacable nature of their vitzliputzli to whom they sacrificd the hearts of men cut out whilst they were alive  the monstrous figure and labourd deformity of that abominable idol are a lively representation of the direful ideas those wretches framed to themselves of an invisible overruling power and plainly shew us how horrid and execrable they thought it to be at the same time that they paid it the highest adoration a and at the expence of human blood endeavourd with fear and trembling if not to     appease the wrath    and rage of it at least to avert in some measure the manifold mischiefs they apprehended from it hor nothing i must own can render declaiming against idolatry more seasonable than a reflection upon the second commandment but as what you have been saying required no great attention i have been thinking of something else thinking on the purport of the third commandment furnishes me with an objection and i think a strong one to what you have affirmd about all laws in general and the decalogue in particular you know i urged that it was wrong to ascribe the faults of bad men to human nature in general cleo i do and thought i had answered you hor let me try only once more which of the two pray do you think prophane swearing to proceed from a frailty in our nature or an ill custom generally contracted by keeping of bad company cleo certainly the latter hor then it is evident to me that this law is levelld at the bad men only that are guilty of the vice forbid in it and not any frailty belonging to human nature in general cleo i believe you mistake the design of this law and am of opinion that it has a much higher aim than you seem to imagine you remember my saying that reverence to    authority was necessary to make human creatures governable hor very well and that reverence was a compound of fear love and esteem cleo now let us take a view of what is done in the decalogue in the short preamble to it expressly made that the israelites should know who it was that spoke to them god manifests himself to those whom he had chosen for his people by a most remarkable instance of his own great power and their strong obligation to him in a fact that none of them could be ignorant of there is a plainness and grandeur     withal in this sentence than which nothing can be more truly sublime or majestick and i defy the learned world to shew me another as comprehensive and of equal weight and dignity that so fully executes its purpose and answers its design with the same simplicity of words in that part of the second commandment which contains the motives and inducements why men should obey the divine laws are set forth in the most emphatical manner first gods wrath on those that hate him and the continuance of it on their posterity secondly the wide extent of his mercy to those who love him and keep his commandments if we duely consider these passages we shall find that fear as well as love and the highest esteem are plainly and distinctly inculcated in them and that the best method is made use    of there to inspire men with a deep sense of the three ingredients that make up the compound of reverence the reason is plain if people were to be governd by that body of laws nothing was more necessary to enforce their obedience to them than their awful regard and utmost veneration to him at whose command they were to keep them and to whom they were accountable for the breaking of them hor what answer is all this to my objection cleo have a moments patience i am coming to it mankind are naturally fickle and delight in change and variety they seldom retain long the same impression of things they receivd at first when they were new to them and they are apt to undervalue if not despise the best when they grow common i am of opinion that the third commandment points at this frailty this want of steadiness in our nature the ill consequences of which in our duty to the creator could not be better prevented than by a strict observance of this law in never making use of his name but in the most solemn manner on necessary occasions and in matters of high importance as in the foregoing part of the decalogue care had been already   0 taken by the strongest motives to create and attract reverence so nothing could be more wisely adapted to strengthen and make it everlasting than   0the contents of this law for as too much familiarity breeds contempt so our highest regard due to what is most sacred cannot be kept up better than by a quite contrary practice hor i am answerd cleo what weight reverence is thought to be of to procure obedience we may learn from the same body of laws in another commandment children have no opportunity of learning their duty but from their parents and those who act by their authority or in their stead therefore it was requisite that men should not only stand in great dread of the law of god but likewise have great reverence for those who first inculcated it and communicated to them that this was the law of god hor but you said that the reverence of children to parents was a natural consequence of what thea first experiencd from the latter cleo you think there was no occasion for this law if man would do what is commanded in it of his own accord but i desire you would consider that tho the reverence of children to parents is a natural consequence partly of the benefits and chastisements they receive from them and partly of the great opinion they form of the superiour capacity they observe in them experience teaches us that this reverence may be over   ruled by stronger passions and therefore it being of the highest moment to all government and sociableness itself god thought fit to fortify and strengthen it in us by a particular command of his own and moreover to encourage it by the promise of a reward for the keeping of it it is our parents that first cure us of our natural wildness and break in us the spirit of independancy we are all born with it is to them we owe the first rudiments of our submission and to the honour and deference     which children pay to parents all societies are obligd for the principle of human obedience the instinct of sovereignty in our nature and the waywardness of infants which is the consequence of it discover themselves with the least glimmering of our understanding and before children that have been most neglected and the least taught are always the most stubborn and obstinate and none are more unruly and fonder of following their own will than those that are least capable of governing themselves hor then this commandment you think not obligatory when we come to years of maturity cleo far from it for though the benefit politically intended by this law be chiefly receivd by us whilst we are under age and the tuition of parents yet for that very reason ought the duty commanded in it never    to cease we are fond of imitating our superiors from our cradle and whilst this honour and reverence to parents continue to be paid by their children when they are grown men and women and act for themselves the example is of singular use to all minors in teaching them their duty and not to refuse what they see others that are older and wiser comply with by choice for by this means as their understanding encreases this duty by degrees becomes a fashion which at last their pride will not suffer them to neglect hor what you said last is certainly the reason that among fashionable people even the most vicious and wicked do outward homage and pay respect to parents at least before the world tho they act against and in their hearts hate them cleo here is another instance to convince us that good manners are not inconsistent with wickedness and that men may be strict observers of decorums and take pains to seem wellbred and at the same time have no regard to the laws of god and live in contempt of religion and therefore to procure an outward compliance with this fifth commandment no lecture can be of such force nor any instruction     so edifying to youth among the modish sort of people as the sight of a strong and vigorous as well as polite and well dressd man in a dispute giving way and submitting to a decrepit parent     hor but do you imagine that all the divine laws even those that seem only to relate to god himself his power and glory and our obedience to his will abstract from any consideration of our neighbour had likewise a regard to the good of society and the temporal happiness of his people cleo there is no doubt of that witness the keeping of the sabbath hor we have seen that very handsomely proved in one of the spectators  cleo but the usefulness of it in human affairs is of far greater moment than that which the author of that paper chiefly takes notice of of all the difficulties that mankind have labourd under in completing society nothing has been more puzling or perplexing than the division of time our annual course round the sun not answering exactly any number of compleat days or hours has been the occasion of immense study and labour and nothing has more rackd the brain of man than the adjusting the year to prevent the confusion of seasons but even when the year was divided into lunar months the computation of time must have been impracticable among the common people to remember twenty nine or thirty days where feasts are irregular and all other days shew alike must have been a great burden to the memory and caused a continual confusion among the ignorant whereas a short pe   riod soon returning is easily remembred and one fixd day in seven so remarkably distinguishd from the rest must rub up the memory of the most unthinking hor i believe that the sabbath is a considerable help in the computation of time and of greater use     in human affairs than can be easily imagind by those who never knew the want of it cleo but what is most remarkable in this fourth commandment is gods revealing himself to his people and acquainting an infant nation with a truth which the rest of the world remaind ignoranta of for many ages men were soon made sensible of the suns power observed every meteor in the sky and suspected the influence of the moon and other stars but it was a long time and man was far advanced in sublime notions before the light of nature could raise mortal thought to the contemplation of an infinite being that is the author of the whole hor you have descanted on this sufficiently when you spoke of moses pray let us proceed to the further establishment of society i am satisfied that the third step towards it is the invention of letters that without them no laws can be long effectual and that the principal laws of all countries are remedies against human frailties i mean that they are designd as antidotes to prevent the ill consequences of some properties insepa   rable from our nature which yet in themselves without management or restraint are obstructive and pernicious to society i am persuaded likewise that these frailties are palpably pointed at in the decalogue that it was wrote with great wisdom and that there is not one commandment in it that has not a regard to the temporal good of society as well as matters of higher moment cleo these are the things indeed that i have endeavord to prove and now all the great difficulties and chief obstructions that can hinder a multitude from being formd into a body politick are removed when once men come to be governd by written laws all the rest comes on apace now property and safety of life and limb may be secured this naturally will forward the love of     peace and make it spread no number of men when once they enjoy quiet and no man needs to fear his neighbour will be long without learning to divide and subdivide their labour hor i dont understand you cleo man as i have hinted before naturally loves to imitate what he sees others do which is the reason that savage people all do the same thing this hinders them from meliorating their condition though they are always wishing for it but if one will wholly apply himself to the making of bows and arrows whilst another provides food a    third builds huts a fourth makes garments and a fifth utensils they not only become useful to one another but the callings and employments themselves will in the same number of years receive much greater improvements than if all had been promiscuously followd by every one of the five hor i believe you are perfectly right there and the truth of what you say is in nothing so conspicuous as it is in watchmaking which is come to a higher degree of perfection than it would have been arrived at yet if the whole had always remaind the employment of one person and i am persuaded that even the plenty we have of clocks and watches as well as the exactness and beauty they may be made of are chiefly owing to the division that has been made of that art into many branches cleo the use of letters must likewise very much improve speech it self which before that time cannot but be very barren and precarious hor i am glad to hear you mention speech again i would not interrupt you when you named it once before  pray what language did your wild couple speak when first they met cleo from what i have said already it is evident that they could have had none at all at least that is a my opinion         hor then wild people must have an instinct to understand one another which they lose when they are civilizd cleo i am persuaded that nature has made all animals of the same kind in their mutual commerce intelligible to one another as far as is requisite for the preservation of themselves and their species and as to my wild couple as you call them i believe there would be a very good understanding before many sounds past between them it is not without some difficulty that a man born in society can form an idea of such savages and their condition and unless he has used himself to abstract thinking he can hardly represent to himself such a state of simplicity in which man can have so few desires and no appetites roving beyond the immediate call of untaught nature to me it seems very plain that such a couple would not only be destitute of language but likewise never find out or imagine that they stood in need of any or that the want of it was any real inconvenience to them hor why do you think so cleo because it is impossible that any creature should know the want of what it can have no idea of i believe moreover that if savages after they are grown men and women should hear others speak be made acquainted with the usefulness of speech    and consequently become sensible of the want of it in themselves their inclination to learn it would be as inconsiderable as their capacity and if they should attempt it they would find it an immense labour a thing not to be surmounted because the suppleness and flexibility in the organs of speech that children are endued with and which i have often hinted at would be lost in them and they might learn to play masterly upon the violin or any other the most difficult musical instrument before they could make any tolerable proficiency in speaking hor brutes make several distinct sounds to express different passions by as for example anguish and     great danger dogs of all sorts express with another noise than they do rage and anger and the whole species express grief by howling cleo this is no argument to make us believe that nature has endued man with speech there are innumerable other privileges and instincts which some brutes enjoy and men are destitute of chickens run about as soon as they are hatchd and most quadrupedes can walk without help as soon as they are brought forth if ever language came by instinct the people that spoke it must have known every individual word in it and a man in the wild state of nature would have no occasion for a thousandth part of the most barren language that ever had a    name when a mans knowledge is confind within a narrow compass and he has nothing to obey but the simple dictates of nature the want of speech is easily supplyd by dumb signs and it is more natural to untaught men to express themselves by gestures than by sounds but we are all born with a capacity of making ourselves understood beyond other animals without speech to express grief joy love wonder and fear there are certain tokens that are common to the whole species who doubts that the crying of children was given them by nature to call assistance and raise pity which latter it does so unaccountably beyond any other sound hor in mothers and nurses you mean cleo i mean in the generality of human creatures will you allow me that warlike musick generally rouses and supports the spirits and keeps them from sinking hor i believe i must cleo then ill engage that the crying i mean the vagitus of helpless infants will stir up compassion in the generality of our species that are within the hearing of it with much greater certainty than drums and trumpets will dissipate and chase away fear in those they are applied to weeping laughing smiling     frowning sighing exclaiming we spoke of before how universal as well as copious is the language of the eyes by   0the help of which the remotest nations understand one another at first sight taught or untaught in the weightiest temporal concern that belongs to the species and in that language our wild couple would at their first meeting intelligibly say more to one another without guile than any civilizd pair would dare to name without blushing hor a man without doubt may be as impudent with his eyes as he can be with his tongue cleo all such looks therefore and several motions that are natural are carefully avoided among polite people upon no other account than that they are too significant it is for the same reason that stretching ourselves before others whilst we are yawning is an absolute breach of good manners especially in mixd company of both sexes as it is indecent to display any of these tokens so it is unfashionable to take notice of or seem to understand them this disuse and neglect of them is the cause that whenever they happen to be made either through ignorance or wilful rudeness many of them are lost and really not understood by the beau monde that would be very plain to savages without language who could have no other means of conversing than by signs and motions hor but if the old stock would never either be able or willing to acquire speech it is impossible they could teach it their chil   dren then which way could any language ever come into the world from two savages cleo by slow degrees as all other arts and sciences have done and length of time agriculture physick astronomy architecture painting c from what we see in children that are backward with their tongues we have reason to think that a wild pair would make themselves intelligible to each other by signs and gestures before they would attempt it by sounds but when they lived together for many     years it is very probable that for the things they were most conversant with they would find out sounds to stir up in each other the ideas of such things when they were out of sight these sounds they would communicate to their young ones and the longer they lived together the greater variety of sounds they would invent as well for actions as the things themselves they would find that the volubility of tongue and flexibility of voice were much greater in their young ones than they could remember it ever to have been in themselves it is impossible but some of these young ones would either by accident or design make use of this superior aptitude of the organs at one time or other which every generation would still improve upon and this must have been the origin of all languages and speech it self that were not taught by inspiration  i believe moreover that after language i    mean such as is of     human invention was come to a great degree of perfection and even when people had distinct words for every action in life as well as every thing they meddled or conversd with signs and gestures still continued to be made for a great while to accompany speech because both are intended for the same purpose hor the design of speech is to make our thoughts known to others cleo i dont think so hor what dont men speak to be understood cleo in one sense they do but there is a double meaning in those words which i believe you did not intend if by mans speaking to be understood you mean that when men speak they desire that the purport of the sounds they utter should be known and apprehended by others i answer in the affirmative but if you mean by it that men speak in order that their thoughts may be known and their sentiments laid open and seen through by others which likewise may be meant by speaking to be understood i answer in the negative the first sign or sound that ever man made born of a woman was made in behalf and intended for the use of him who made it and i am of opinion that the first design of speech was to persuade others either to give credit to what the speaking person would have them    believe or else to act or suffer such things as he would compel them to act or suffer if they were entirely in his power hor speech is likewise made use of to teach advise and inform others for their benefit as well as to persuade them in our own behalf cleo and so by the help of it men may accuse themselves and own their crimes but no body would have invented speech for those purposes i speak of the design the first motive and intention that put man upon speaking we see in children that the first things they endeavour to express with words are their   0 wants and their will and their speech is but a confirmation of what they askd denyd or affirmd by signs before hor but why do you imagine that people would continue to make use of signs and gestures after they could sufficiently express themselves in words cleo because signs confirm words as much as words do signs and we see even in polite people that when they are very eager they can hardly forbear making use of both when an infant in broken imperfect gibberish calls for a cake or a plaything and at the same time points at and reaches after it this double endeavour makes a stronger impression upon us than if the child had either spoke its wants in plain words without making any signs or else lookd at and reachd    after the thing wanted without attempting to speak speech and action assist and corroborate one another and experience teaches us that they move us much more and are more persuasive jointly than separately vis unita fortior and when an infant makes use of both he acts from the same principle that an orator does when he joins proper gestures to an elaborate declamation hor from what you have said it should seem that action is not only more natural but likewise more ancient than speech it self which before i should have thought a paradox cleo yet it is true and you shall always find that the most forward volatile and fiery tempers make more use of gestures when they speak than others that are more patient and sedate hor it is a very diverting scene to see how this is overdone among the french and still more among the portuguese i have often been amazed to see what distortions of face and body as well as other strange gesticulations with hands and feet some of them will make in their ordinary discourses but nothing was more offensive to me when i was abroad than     the loudness and violence which most foreigners speak with even among persons of quality when a dispute arises or any thing is to be debated before i was used to it it put me always upon my guard for i    did not question but they were angry and i often recollected what had been said in order to consider whether it was not something i ought to have resented cleo the natural ambition and strong desire men have to triumph over as well as persuade others are the occasion of all this heightning and lowring the voice at proper seasons is a bewitching engine to captivate mean understandings and loudness is an assistant to speech as well as action is uncorrectness false grammar and even want of sense are often happily drownd in noise and great bustle and many an argument has been convincing that had all its force from the vehemence it was made with the weakness of the language it self may be palliatively cured by strength of elocution hor i am glad that speaking low is the fashion among wellbred people in england for bawling and impetuosity i cannot endure cleo yet this latter is more natural and no man ever gave in to the contrary practice the fashion you like that was not taught it either by precept or example and if men do not accustom themselves to it whilst they are young it is very difficult to comply with it afterwards but it is the most lovely as well as most rational piece of good manners that human invention has to boast of in the art of flattery for when a man    addresses himself to me in a calm manner without making gestures or other motions with head or body and continues his discourse in the same submissive strain and composure of voice without exalting or depressing it he in the first place displays his own modesty and humility in an agreeable manner and in the second makes me a great compliment in     the opinion which he seems to have of me for by such a behaviour he gives me the pleasure to imagine that he thinks me not influencd by my passions but altogether swayd by my reason he seems to lay his stress on my judgment and therefore to desire that i should weigh and consider what he says without being ruffled or disturbed no man would do this unless he trusted entirely to my good sense and the rectitude of my understanding hor i have always admired this unaffected manner of speaking tho i never examined so deeply into the meaning of it cleo i cant help thinking but that next to the laconick and manly spirit that runs through the nation we are very much beholden for the strength and beauty of our language to this tranquility in discourse which for many years has been in england more than any where else a custom peculiar to the beau monde who in all countries are the undoubted refiners of language     hor i thought that it was the preachers playwrights orators and fine writers that refind upon language cleo they make the best of what is ready coind to their hands but the true and only mint of words and phrases is the court and the polite part of every nation are in possession of the jus  norma loquendi  all technick words indeed and terms of art belong to the respective artists and dealers that primarily and literally make use of them in their business but whatever is borrowd from them for metaphorical use or from other languages living or dead must first have the stamp of the court and the approbation of the beau monde before it can pass for current and whatever is not used among them or comes abroad without their sanction is either vulgar pedantick or obsolete orators therefore historians and all wholesale     dealers in words are confind to those that have been already well receivd and from that treasure they may pick and chuse what is most for their purpose but they are not allowd to make new ones of their own any more than bankers are sufferd to coin hor all this while i cannot comprehend what advantage or disadvantage speaking loud or low can be of to the language it self and if what i am saying now was set down it must be a real conjurer that half a year hence    should be able to tell by the writing whether it had been bawld out or whisperd cleo i am of opinion that when people of skill and address accustom themselves to speak in the manner aforesaid it must in time have an influence upon the language and render it strong and expressive hor but your reason cleo when a man has only his words to trust to and the hearer is not to be affected by the delivery of them otherwise than if he was to read them himself it will infallibly put men upon studying not only for nervous thoughts and perspicuity but likewise for words of great energy for purity of diction compactness of style and fullness as well as elegancy of expressions hor this seems to be far fetchd and yet i dont know but there may be something in it cleo i am sure you will think so when you consider that all men that do speak are equally desirous and endeavoring to persuade and gain the point they labour for whether they speak loud or low with gestures or without hor speech you say was invented to persuade i am afraid you lay too much stress upon that it certainly is made use of likewise for many other purposes cleo i dont deny that     hor when people scold call names and pelt one     another with scurrilities what design is that done with if it be to persuade others to have a worse opinion of themselves than they are supposed to entertain i believe it is seldom done with success cleo calling names is shewing others and shewing them with pleasure and ostentation the vile and wretched opinion we have of them and persons that make use of opprobrious language are often endeavouring to make those whom they give it to believe that they think worse of them than they really do hor worse than they do whence does that ever appear cleo from the behaviour and the common practice of those that scold and call names they rip up and exaggerate not only the faults and imperfections of their adversary himself but likewise every thing that is ridiculous or contemptible in his friends or relations they will fly to and reflect upon every thing which he is but in the least concernd in if any thing can possibly be said of it that is reproachful the occupation he follows the party he sides with or the country he is of they repeat with joy the calamities and misfortunes that have befaln him or his family they see the justice of providence in them and they are sure they are punishments he has deservd whatever crime he has been sus  0pected of they charge him with as if it had been proved upon him they call in every thing to their assistance bare surmises loose reports and known calumnies and often upbraid him with what they themselves at other times have ownd not to believe hor but how comes the practice of scolding and calling names to be so common among the vulgar all the world over there must be a pleasure in it tho i cannot conceive it i ask to be informd what satisfaction or other benefit is it that men receive or expect from it what view is it done with cleo the real cause and inward motive men act     from when they use ill language or call names in earnest is in the first place to give vent to their anger which it is troublesome to stifle and conceal secondly to vex and afflict their enemies with greater hopes of impunity than they could reasonably entertain if they did them any more substantial mischief which the law would revenge but this never comes to be a custom nor is thought of before language is arrived to great perfection and society is carried to some degree of politeness hor thats merry enough to assert that scurrility is the effect of politeness cleo you shall call it what you please but in its original it is a plain shift to avoid fighting and the ill consequences of it for no body ever calld another rogue and rascal    but he would have struck him if it had been in his own power and himself had not been withheld by the fear of something or other therefore where people call names without doing further injury it is a sign not only that they have wholesome laws amongst them against open force and violence but likewise that they obey and stand in awe of them and a man begins to be a tolerable subject and is nigh half civilizd that in his passion will take up and content himself with this paultry equivalent which never was done without great selfdenial at first for otherwise the obvious ready and unstudyd manner of venting and expressing anger which nature teaches is the same in human creatures that it is in other animals and is done by fighting as we may observe in infants of two or three months old that never yet saw any body out of humour for even at that age theyll scratch fling and strike with their heads as well as arms and legs when any thing raises their anger which is easily and at most times unaccountably provokd often by hunger pain and other inward ailments that they do this by instinct something implanted in the frame the mechanism of the body     before any marks of wit or reason are to be seen in them i am fully persuaded as i am likewise that nature teaches them the manner of fighting peculiar to their species and children strike with their arms as naturally    as horses kick dogs bite and bulls push with their horns i beg your pardon for this digression hor it was natural enough but if it had been less so you would not have slipt the opportunity of having a fling at human nature which you never spare cleo we have not a more dangerous enemy than our own inborn pride i shall ever attack and endeavour to mortify it when it is in my power for the more we are persuaded that the greatest excellencies the best men have to boast of are acquired the greater stress it will teach us to lay upon education and the more truly sollicitous it will render us about it and the absolute necessity of good and early instructions can be no way more clearly demonstrated than by exposing the deformity as well as the weakness of our untaught nature hor let us return to speech if the chief design of it is to persuade the french have got the start of us a great way theirs is really a charming language cleo so it is without doubt to a frenchman hor and every body else i should think that understands it and has any taste dont you think it to be very engaging cleo yes to one that loves his belly for it is very copious in the art of cookery and every thing that belongs to eating and drinking      hor but without banter dont you think that the french tongue is more proper more fit to persuade in than ours cleo to coax and wheedle in i believe it may hor i cant conceive what nicety it is you aim at in that distinction cleo the word you named includes no idea of     reproach or disparagement the greatest capacities may without discredit to them yield to persuasion as well as the least but those who can be gaind by coaxing and wheedling are commonly supposed to be persons of mean parts and weak understandings hor but pray come to the point which of the two do you take to be the finest language cleo that is hard to determine nothing is more difficult than to compare the beauties of two languages together because what is very much esteemd in the one is often not relishd at all in the other in this point the pulchrum  honestum varies and is different every where as the genius of the people differs i dont set up for a judge but what i have commonly observed in the two languages is this all favourite expressions in french are such as either sooth or tickle and nothing is more admired in english than what pierces or strikes hor do you take yourself to be entirely impartial now     cleo i think so but if i am not i dont know how to be sorry for it there are some things in which it is the interest of the society that men should be biassd and i dont think it amiss that men should be inclined to love their own language from the same principle that they love their country the french call us barbarous and we say they are fawning i wont believe the first let them believe what they please do you remember the six lines in the cid which corneille is said to have had a present of six thousand livres for hor very well   mon pere est mort elvire  la premiere espée   donta sest armé rodrigue a sa trame coupée   pleurès pleurès mes yeux  fondes vous en eau   la moitié de ma vie a mis lautre au tombeau   et moblige à venger apres ce coup funeste   celle b que je nay plus sur celle qui me reste      cleo the same thought expressd in our language to all the advantage it has in the french would be hissd by an english audience  hor thats no compliment to the taste of your country     cleo i dont know that men may have no bad taste and yet not be so ready at conceiving which way one half of ones life can put the other into the grave to me i own it is puzling and it has too much the air of a riddle to be seen in heroick poetry hor can you find no delicacy at all in the thought cleo yes but it is too fine spun it is the delicacy of a cobweb there is no strength in it hor i have always admired these lines but now you have made me out of conceit with them methinks i spy another fault thats much greater cleo what is that hor the author makes his heroine say a thing which was false in fact one half says chimene of my life has put the other into the grave and obliges me to revenge c which is the nominative of the verb obliges cleo one half of my life hor here lies the fault it is this which i think     is not true for the one half of her life here mentiond is plainly that half which was left it is rodrigues her lover which way did he oblige her to seek for revenge cleo by what he had done killing her father hor no cleomenes this excuse is insufficient chimenes calamity sprung from the dilemma she was in between her love and    her duty when the latter was inexorable and violently pressing her to sollicit the punishment and employ with zeal all her interest and eloquence to obtain the death of him whom the first had made dearer to her than her own life and therefore it was the half that was gone that was put in the grave her dead father and not rodrigues which obliged her to sue for justice had the obligation she lay under come from this quarter it might soon have been cancelld and herself releasd without crying out her eyes cleo i beg pardon for differing from you but i believe the poet is in the right hor pray consider which it was that made chimene prosecute rodrigues love or honour cleo i do but still i cant help thinking but that her lover by having killd her father obliged chimene to prosecute him in the same manner as a man who will give no satisfaction to his creditors obliges them to arrest him or as we would say to a coxcomb who is offending us with his discourse if you go on thus sir youll oblige me to treat you ill tho all this while the debtor might be as little desirous of being arrested and the coxcomb of being ill treated as rodrigues was of being prosecuted hor i believe you are in the right and i beg corneilles pardon but now i desire you would tell me what you have further to say    of society what other advantages do multitudes receive from the invention of letters besides the improvements it makes in their laws and language  00 cleo it is an incouragement to all other inventions in general by preserving the knowledge of every useful improvement that is made when laws begin to be well known and the execution of them is facilitated by general approbation multitudes may be kept in tolerable concord among themselves it is then that it appears and not before how much the superiority of mans understanding beyond other animals contributes to his sociableness which is only retarded by it in his savage state hor how so pray i dont understand you cleo the superiority of understanding in the first place makes man sooner sensible of grief and joy and capable of entertaining either with greater difference as to the degrees than they are felt in other creatures secondly it renders him more industrious to please himself that is it furnishes selflove with a greater variety of shifts to exert itself on all emergencies than is made use of by animals of less capacity superiority of understanding likewise gives us a foresight and inspires us with hopes of which other creatures have little and that only of things immediately before them all these things are    so many tools arguments by which selflove reasons us into content and renders us patient under many afflictions for the sake of supplying those wants that are most pressing this is of infinite use to a man who finds himself born in a body politick and it must make him fond of society whereas the same endowment before that time the same superiority of understanding in the state of nature can only serve to render man incurably averse to society and more obstinately tenacious of his savage liberty than any other creature would be that is equally necessitous hor i dont know how to refute you there is a justness of thought in what you say which i am forcd to assent to and yet it seems strange how come you by this insight into the heart of man and  0  which way is that skill of unravelling humane nature to be obtaind cleo by diligently observing what excellencies and qualifications are really acquired in a wellaccomplishd man and having done this impartially we may be sure that the remainder of him is nature it is for want of duly separating and keeping asunder these two things that men have utterd such absurdities on this subject alledging as the causes of mans fitness for society such qualifications as no man ever was endued with that was not educated in a society a civil establish   ment of several hundred years standing but the flatterers of our species keep this carefully from our view instead of separating what is acquired from what is natural and distinguishing between them they take pains to unite and confound them together hor why do they i dont see the compliment since the acquired as well as natural parts belong to the same person and the one is not more inseparable from him than the other cleo nothing is so near to a man nor so really and entirely his own as what he has from nature and when that dear self for the sake of which he values or despises loves or hates every thing else comes to be stript and abstracted from all foreign acquisitions humane nature makes a poor figure it shews a nakedness or at least an undress which no man cares to be seen in there is nothing we can be possessd of that is worth having which we do not endeavour closely to annex and make an ornament of to ourselves even wealth and power and all the gifts of fortune that are plainly adventitious and altogether remote from our persons whilst they are our right and property we dont love to be considerd without them we see likewise that men who are come to be great in the world from despicable beginnings dont love to hear of their origin  0    0 hor that is no general rule cleo i believe it is tho there may be exceptions from it and these are not without reasons when a man is proud of his parts and wants to be esteemd for his diligence penetration quickness and assiduity hell make perhaps an ingenuous confession even to the exposing of his parents and in order to set off the merit that raisd him be speaking himself of his original meanness but this is commonly done before inferiours whose envy will be lessend by it and who will applaud his candor and humility in owning this blemish but not a word of this before his betters who value themselves upon their families and such men could heartily wish that their parentage was unknown whenever they are with those that are their equals in quality tho superior to them in birth by whom they know that they are hated for their advancement and despisd for the lowness of their extraction but i have a shorter way of proving my assertion pray is it good manners to tell a man that he is meanly born or to hint at his descent when it is known to be vulgar hor no i dont say it is cleo that decides it by shewing the general opinion about it noble ancestors and every thing else that is honourable and esteemd and can be drawn within our sphere are an advantage to our persons and we all    desire they should be lookd upon as our own hor ovid did not think so when he said nam genus  proavos  quæ non fecimus ipsi vix ea nostra voco  cleo a pretty piece of modesty in a speech where a man takes pains to prove that jupiter was his great grandfather what signifies a theory which a man destroys by his practice did you ever know a person of quality pleasd with being calld a bastard tho he  0  owed his being as well as his greatness chiefly to his mothers impudicity hor by things acquired i thought you meant learning and virtue how come you to talk of birth and descent cleo by shewing you that men are unwilling to have any thing that is honourable separated from themselves tho it is remote from and has nothing to do with their persons i would convince you of the little probability there is that we should be pleased with being considerd abstract from what really belongs to us and qualifications that in the opinion of the best and wisest are the only things for which we ought to be valued when men are wellaccomplishd they are ashamed of the lowest steps from which they rose to that perfection and the more civilizd they are the more they think it injurious to have their nature seen without the improvements that have been made upon it the    most correct authors would blush to see every thing publishd which in the composing of their works they blotted out and stifled and which yet it is certain they once conceivd for this reason they are justly compared to architects that remove the scaffolding before they shew their buildings all ornaments bespeak the value we have for the things adornd dont you think that the first red or white that ever was laid upon a face and the first false hair that was wore were put on with great secrecy and with a design to deceive hor in france painting is now lookd upon as part of a womans dress they make no mystery of it cleo so it is with all the impositions of this nature when they come to be so gross that they can be hid no longer as mens perukes all over europe but if these things could be conceald and were not known the tawny coquette would heartily wish that the ridiculous dawbing she plaisters herself with might  0  pass for complexion and the baldpated beau would be as glad to have his fullbotomd wig lookd upon as a natural head of hair no body puts in artificial teeth but to hide the loss of his own hor but is not a mans knowledge a real part of himself cleo yes and so is his politeness but neither of them belong to his nature any    more than his gold watch or his diamond ring and even from these he endeavours to draw a value and respect to his person the most admired among the fashionable people that delight in outward vanity and know how to dress well would be highly displeasd if their clothes and skill in putting them on should be lookd upon otherwise than as part of themselves nay it is this part of them only which whilst they are unknown can procure them access to the highest companies the courts of princes where it is manifest that both sexes are either admitted or refused by no other judgment than what is formd of them from their dress without the least regard to their goodness or their understanding hor i believe i apprehend you it is our fondness of that self which we hardly know what it consists in that could first make us think of embellishing our persons and when we have taken pains in correcting polishing and beautifying nature the same selflove makes us unwilling to have the ornaments seen separately from the thing adorned cleo the reason is obvious it is that self we are in love with before it is adornd as well as after and every thing which is confessd to be acquired seems to point at our original nakedness and to upbraid us with our natural wants i would say the meanness and deficiency of our nature    that no bravery is so useful in war as that which is artificial is undeniable yet the soldier that by art and discipline has manifestly been trickd and wheedled into courage after  0  he has behaved himself in two or three battles with intrepidity will never endure to hear that he has not natural valour  tho all his acquaintance as well as himself remember the time that he was an arrant coward hor but since the love affection and benevolence we naturally have for our species is not greater than other creatures have for theirs how comes it that man gives more ample demonstrations of this love on thousand occasions than any other animal cleo because no other animal has the same capacity or opportunity to do it but you may ask the same of his hatred the greater knowledge and the more wealth and power a man has the more capable he is of rendring others sensible of the passion he is affected with as well when he hates as when he loves them the more a man remains uncivilizd and the less he is removd from the state of nature the less his love is to be depended upon hor there is more honesty and less deceit among plain untaught people than there is among those that are more artful and therefore i should have lookd for true love and unfeignd affection among those that live    in a natural simplicity rather than any where else cleo you speak of sincerity but the love which i said was less to be depended upon in untaught than in civilisd people i supposed to be real and sincere in both artful people may dissemble love and pretend to friendship where they have none but they are influencd by their passions and natural appetites as well as savages though they gratify them in another manner wellbred people behave themselves in the choice of diet and the taking of their repastes very differently from savages so they do in their amours but hunger and lust are the same in both an artful man nay the greatest hypocrite whatever his behaviour is abroad may love his wife and children  0  at his heart and the sincerest man can do no more my business is to demonstrate to you that the good qualities men compliment our nature and the whole species with are the result of art and education the reason why love is little to be depended upon in those that are uncivilisd is because the passions in them are more fleeting and inconstant they oftener jostle out and succeed one another than they are and do in wellbred people persons that are well educated have learnd to study their ease and the comforts of life to tye themselves up to rules and decorums for their own advantage and often to submit to small    inconveniencies to avoid greater among the lowest vulgar and those of the meanest education of all you seldom see a lasting harmony you shall have a man and his wife that have a real affection for one another be full of love one hour and disagree the next for a trifle and the lives of many are made miserable from no other faults in themselves than their want of manners and discretion without design they will often talk imprudently till they raise one anothers anger which neither of them being able to stifle she scolds at him he beats her she bursts out into tears this moves him he is sorry both repent and are friends again and with all the sincerity imaginable resolve never to quarrel for the future as long as they live all this will pass between them in less than half a day and will perhaps be repeated once a month or oftner as provocations offer or either of them is more or less prone to anger affection never remaind long uninterrupted between two persons without art and the best friends if they are always together will fall out unless great discretion be used on both sides hor i have always been of your opinion that the more men were civilisd the happier they were but since nations can never be made polite but by length of time and mankind must have been always miserable  0  before they had written laws how come poets    and others to launch out so much in praise of the golden age in which they pretend there was so much peace love and sincerity cleo for the same reason that heralds compliment obscure men of unknown extraction with illustrious pedigrees as there is no mortal of high descent but who values himself upon his family so extolling the virtue and happiness of their ancestors can never fail pleasing every member of a society but what stress would you lay upon the fictions of poets hor you reason very clearly and with great freedom against all heathen superstition and never suffer yourselfa to be imposed upon by any fraud from that quarter but when you meet with any thing belonging to the jewish or christian religion you are as credulous as any of the vulgar cleo i am sorry you should think so hor what i say is fact a man that contentedly swallows every thing that is said of noah and his ark ought not to laugh at the story of deucalion and pyrrha  cleo is it as credible that human creatures should spring from stones because an old man and his wife threw them over their heads as that a man and his family with a great number of birds and beasts should be preservd in a large ship made convenient for that purpose     hor but you are partial what odds is there between a stone and a lump of earth for either of them to become a human creature i can as easily conceive how a stone should be turnd into a man or a woman as how a man or a woman should be turnd into a stone and i think it not more strange that a woman should be changd into a tree as was  0  daphne or into marble as niobe  than that she should be transformd into a pillar of salt as the wife of lot was pray suffer me to catechize you a little cleo youll hear me afterwards i hope hor yes yes do you believe hesiod cleo no hor ovids metamorphosis cleo no hor but you believe the story of adam and eve and paradise cleo yes hor that they were produced at once i mean at their full growth he from a lump of earth and she from one of his ribbs cleo yes hor and that as soon as they were made they could speak reason and were endued with knowledge cleo yes hor in short you believe the innocence the delight and all the wonders of paradise that are related by one man at the same time that you will not believe what has been told    us by many of the uprightness the concord and the happiness of a golden age cleo thats very true hor now give me leave to shew you how unaccountable as well as partial you are in this in the first place the things naturally impossible which you believe are contrary to your own doctrine the opinion you have laid down and which i believe to be true for you have proved that no man would ever be able to speak unless he was taught it that reasoning and thinking come upon us by slow degrees and that we can know nothing that has not from without been conveyed to the brain and communicated to us through the organs of the senses secondly in what you reject as fabulous there is no  0  manner of improbability we know from history and daily experience teaches us that almost all the wars and private quarrels that have at any time disturbed mankind have had their rise from the differences about superiority and the meum  tuum therefore before cunning covetousness and deceit crept into the world before titles of honour and the distinction between servant and master were known why might not moderate numbers of people have lived together in peace and amity when they enjoyd every thing in common and have been content with the product of the earth in a fertile soil and a happy climate why cant you believe this   0 cleo because it is inconsistent with the nature of human creatures that any number of them should ever live together in tolerable concord without laws or government let the soil the climate and their plenty be whatever the most luxuriant imagination shall be pleasd to fancy them but adam was altogether the workmanship of god a præternatural production his speech and knowledge his goodness and innocence were as miraculous as every other part of his frame hor indeed cleomenes this is insufferable when we are talking philosophy you foist in miracles why may not i do the same and say that the people of the golden age were made happy by miracle cleo it is more probable that one miracle should at a stated time have produced a male and female from whom all the rest of mankind are descended in a natural way than that by a continued series of miracles several generations of people should have all been made to live and act contrary to their nature for this must follow from the account we have of the golden and silver ages  in moses the first natural man the first that was born of a woman by envying   0 and slaying his brother gives an ample evidence of the domineering spirit and the principle of sovereignty which i have asserted to belong to our nature     hor you will not be counted credulous and yet you believe all those stories which even some of our divines have calld ridiculous if literally understood but i dont insist upon the golden age if youll give up paradise a man of sense and a philosopher should believe neither cleo yet you have told me that you believd the old and new testament hor i never said that i believd every thing that is in them in a litteral sense but why should you believe miracles at all cleo because i cant help it and i promise never to mention the name to you again if you can shew me the bare possibility that man could have ever been produced brought into the world without miracle do you believe there ever was a man who had made himself hor no thats a plain contradiction cleo then it is manifest the first man must have been made by something and what i say of man i may say of all matter and motion in general the doctrine of epicurus that every thing is derivd from the concourse and fortuitous jumble of atoms is monstrous and extravagant beyond all other follies hor yet there is no mathematical demonstration against it cleo nor is there one to prove that the sun is not in love with the moon if one had a mind to advance it and yet i think it a    greater reproach to human understanding to believe either than it is to believe the most childish stories that are told of fairies and hobgoblins hor but there is an axiom very little inferior to     a mathematical demonstration ex nihilo nihil fit that is directly clashing with and contradicts the creation out of nothing do you understand how something can come from nothing cleo i do not i confess any more than i can comprehend eternity or the deity itself but when i cannot comprehend what my reason assures me must necessarily exist there is no axiom or demonstration clearer to me than that the fault lies in my want of capacity the shallowness of my understanding from the little we know of the sun and stars their magnitudes distances and motion and what we are more nearly acquainted with the gross visible parts in the structure of animals and their oeconomy it is demonstrable that they are the effects of an intelligent cause and the contrivance of a being infinite in wisdom as well as power hor but let wisdom be as superlative and power as extensive as it is possible for them to be still it is impossible to conceive how they should exert themselves unless they had something to act upon cleo this is not the only thing which tho it be true we are not able to conceive    how came the first man to exist and yet here we are heat and moisture are the plain effects from manifest causes and tho they bear a great sway even in the mineral as well as the animal and vegetable world yet they cannot produce a sprig of grass without a previous seed hor as we our selves and every thing we see are the undoubted parts of some one whole some are of opinion that this alla the τὸ πὰν the universe was from all eternity cleo this is not more satisfactory or comprehensible than the system of epicurus who derives every thing from wild chance and an undesignd struggle     of senseless atoms when we behold things which our reason tells us could not have been produced without wisdom and power in a degree far beyond our comprehension can any thing be more contrary to or clashing with that same reason than that the things in which that high wisdom and great power are visibly displayd should be coeval with the wisdom and power themselves that contrivd and wrought them yet this doctrine which is spinosism in epitome after having been neglected many years begins to prevail again and the atoms lose ground for of atheism as well as superstition there are different kinds that have their periods and returns after they have been long exploded     hor what makes you couple together two things so diametrically opposite cleo there is greater affinity between them than you imagine they are of the same origin hor what atheism and superstition cleo yes indeed they both have their rise from the same cause the same defect in the mind of man our want of capacity in discerning truth and natural ignorance of the divine essence men that from their most early youth have not been imbued with the principles of the true religion and have not afterwards continued to be strictly educated in the same are all in great danger of falling either into the one or the other according to the difference there is in the temperament and complexion they are of the circumstances they are in and the company they converse with weak minds and those that are brought up in ignorance and a low condition such as are much exposed to fortune men of slavish principles the covetous and meanspirited are all naturally inclind to and easily susceptible of superstition and there is no absurdity so gross nor contradiction so plain which the dregs of the people most gamesters and nineteen women in twenty may not be     taught to believe concerning invisible causes therefore multitudes are never tainted with irreligion and the less civilizd nations are the more bound   less is their credulity on the contrary men of parts and spirit of thought and reflection the assertors of liberty such as meddle with mathematicks and natural philosophy most inquisitive men the disinterested that live in ease and plenty if their youth has been neglected and they are not well grounded in the principles of the true religion are prone to infidelity especially such amongst them whose pride and sufficiency are greater than ordinary and if persons of this sort fall into hands of unbelievers they run great hazard of becoming atheists or scepticks hor the method of education you recommend in pinning men down to an opinion may be very good to make bigots and raise a strong party to the priests but to have good subjects and moral men nothing is better than to inspire youth with the love of virtue and strongly to imbue them with sentiments of justice and probity and the true notions of honour and politeness these are the true specificks to cure mans nature and destroy in him the savage principles of sovereignty and selfishness that infest and are so mischievous to it as to religious matters prepossessing the mind and forcing youth into a belief is more partial and unfair than it is to leave them unbiassd and unprejudiced till they come to maturity and are fit to judge as well as chuse for themselves     cleo it is this fair and impartial management you speak in praise of that will ever promote and encrease unbelief and nothing has contributed more to the growth of deism in this kingdom than the remisness of education in sacred matters which for some time has been in fashion among the better sort hor the publick welfare ought to be our principal care and i am well assured that it is not bigotry to     a sect or persuasion but common honesty uprightness in all dealings and benevolence to one another which the society stands most in need of cleo a i dont speak up for bigotry and where the christian religion is thoroughly taught as it should be it is impossible that honesty uprightness or benevolence should ever be forgot and no appearances of those virtues are to be trusted to unless they proceed from that motive for without the belief of another world a man is under no obligation for his sincerity in this his very oath is no tye upon him hor what is it upon an hypocrite that dares to be perjured cleo no mans oath is ever taken if it is known that once he has been forsworn nor can i ever be deceivd by an hypocrite when he tells me that he is one and i shall never believe a man to be an atheist unless he owns it himself     hor i dont believe there are real atheists in the world cleo i wont quarrel about words but our modern deism is no greater security than atheism for a mans acknowledging the being of a god even an intelligent first cause is of no use either to himself or others if he denies a providence and a future state hor after all i dont think that virtue has any more relation to credulity than it has to want of faith cleo yet it would and ought to have if we were consistent with ourselves and if men were swayd in their actions by the principles they side with and the opinion they profess themselves to be of all atheists would be devils and superstitious men saints but this is not true there are atheists of good morals and great villains superstitious nay i dont believe there is any wickedness that the worst atheist can     commit but superstitious men may be guilty of it impiety not excepted for nothing is more common amongst rakes and gamesters than to hear men blaspheme that believe in spirits and are afraid of the devil i have no greater opinion of superstition than i have of atheism what i aimd at was to prevent and guard against both and i am persuaded that there is no other antidote to be obtaind by human means so powerful and infallible against the poyson of either as what i have mentiond as to the    truth of our descent from adam i would not be a believer and cease to be a rational creature what i have to say for it is this we are convincd that human understanding is limited and by the help of very little reflection we may be as certain that the narrowness of its bounds its being so limited is the very thing the sole cause which palpably hinders us from diving into our origin by dint of penetration the consequence is that to come at the truth of this origin which is of very great concern to us something is to be believd but what or whom to believe is the question if i cannot demonstrate to you that moses was divinely inspired youll be forcd to confess that there never was any thing more extraordinary in the world than that in a most superstitious age one man brought up among the grossest idolaters that had the vilest and most abominable notions of the godhead should without help as we know of find out the most hidden and most important truths by his natural capacity only for besides the deep insight he had in human nature as appears from the decalogue it is manifest that he was acquainted with the creation out of nothing the unity and immense greatness of that invisible power that has made the universe and that he taught this to the israëlites fifteen centuries before any other nation upon earth was so far enlightend it is undeniable moreover that the    history of moses concerning the beginning of     the world and mankind is the most ancient and least improbable of any that are extant that others who have wrote after him on the same subject appear most of them to be imperfect copiers of him and that the relations which seem not to have been borrowd from moses as the accounts we have of sommonacodom  confucius  and others are less rational and fifty times more extravagant and incredible than any thing containd in the pentateuch as to the things reveald the plan itself abstract from faith and religion when we have weighd every system that has been advanced we shall find that since we must have had a beginning nothing is more rational or more agreeable to good sense than to derive our origin from an incomprehensible creative power that was the first mover and author of all things hor i never heard any body entertain higher notions or more noble sentiments of the deity than at different times i have heard from you pray when you read moses dont you meet with several things in the oeconomy of paradise and the conversation between god and adam that seem to be low unworthy and altogether inconsistent with the sublime ideas you are used to form of the supreme being cleo i freely own not only that i have thought so but likewise that i have long   0stumbled at it but when i consider on the one hand that the more human knowledge encreases the more consummate and unerring the divine wisdom appears to be in every thing we can have any insight into and on the other that the things hitherto detected either     by chance or industry are very inconsiderable both in number and value if compared to the vast multitude of weightier matters that are left behind and remain still undiscoverd when i say i consider these things i cant help thinking that there may be very wise reasons for what we find fault with that are and perhaps ever will be unknown to men as long as the world endures hor but why should we remain labouring under difficulties we can easily solve and not say with dr burnet and several others that those things are allegories and to be understood in a figurative sense  cleo i have nothing against it and shall always applaud the ingenuity and good offices of men who endeavour to reconcile religious mysteries to human reason and probability but i insist upon it that no body can disprove any thing that is said in the pentateuch in the most literal sense and i defy the wit of man to frame or contrive a story the best concerted fable they can invent how man came into the world which i shall not find as much fault with     and be able to make as strong objections to as the enemies of    religion have found with and raisd against the account of moses if i may be allowd to take the same liberty with their known forgery which they take with the bible before they have brought one argument against the veracity of it hor it may be so but as first i was the occasion of this long digression by mentioning the golden age so now i desire we may return to our subject what time how many ages do you think it would require to have a wellcivilizd nation from such a savage pair as yours cleo thats very uncertain and i believe it impossible to determine any thing about it from what has been said it is manifest that the family descending from such a stock would be crumbled to pieces reunited and dispersd again several times before the whole or any part of it could be advanced to any degree of politeness the best forms of government are subject to revolutions and a great many things must concur to keep a society of men together till they become a civilizd nation hor is not a vast deal owing in the raising of a nation to the difference there is in the spirit and genius of people cleo nothing but what depends upon climates which is soon overballancd by skilful government courage and cowardice in all bodies of men depend entirely upon exer   cise and discipline arts and sciences seldom come before riches and both flow in faster or slower according to the capacity of the governours the situation of the people and the opportunities they have of improvements but the first is the chief to preserve peace and tranquility among multitudes of different views and make them all labour for one interest is a great task and nothing in human affairs requires greater knowledge than the art of governing     hor according to your system it should be little more than guarding against human nature cleo but it is a great while before that nature can be rightly understood and it is the work of ages to find out the true use of the passions and to raise a politician that can make every frailty of the members add strength to the whole body and by dextrous management turn private vices into publick benefits  hor it must be a great advantage to an age when many extraordinary persons are born in it cleo it is not genius so much as experience that helps men to good laws solon lycurgus socrates and plato all travelld for their knowledge  which they communicated to others the wisest laws of human invention are generally owing to the evasions of bad men whose cunning had eluded the    force of former ordinances that had been made with less caution hor i fancy that the invention of iron and working the oar into a metal must contribute very much to the completing of society because men can have no tools nor agriculture without it cleo iron is certainly very useful but shells and flints and hardning of wood by fire are substitutes that men make a shift with if they can but have peace live in quiet and enjoy the fruits of their labour could you ever have believd that a man without hands could have shaved himself wrote good characters and made use of a needle and thread with his feet yet this we have seen it is said by some men of reputation that the americans in mexico and peru have all the signs of an infant world because when the europeans first came among them   0 they wanted a great many things that seem to be of easy invention but considering that they had no body to borrow from and no iron at all it is amasing which way they could arrive at the perfection we found them in first it is impossible to know how long multitudes may have been troublesome to one another before the invention of letters came among them and they had any written laws secondly from the many chasms in history we know by experience that the accounts of transactions and times in which lettersa are known    may be entirely lost wars and human discord may destroy the most civilizd nations only by dispersing them and general devastations spare arts and sciences no more than they do cities and palaces that all men are born with a strong desire and no capacity at all to govern has occasiond an infinity of good and evil invasions and persecutions by mixing and scattering our species have made strange alterations in the world sometimes large empires are divided into several parts and produce new kingdoms and principalities at others great conquerors in few years bring different nations under one dominion from the decay of the roman empire alone we may learn that arts and sciences are more perishable much sooner lost than buildings or inscriptions and that a deluge of ignorance may overspread countries without their ceasing to be inhabited hor but what is it at last that raises opulent cities and powerful nations from the smallest beginnings cleo providence hor but providence makes use of means that are visible i want to know the engines it is performd with cleo all the ground work that is required to aggrandise nations you have seen in the fable of the bees all sound politicks and the whole art of     governing are entirely built upon the knowledge of human nature the    great business in general of a politician is to promote and if he can reward all good and useful actions on the one hand and on the other to punish or at least discourage every thing that is destructive or hurtful to society to name particulars would be an endless task anger lust and pride may be the causes of innumerable mischiefs that are all carefully to be guarded against but setting them aside the regulations only that are required to defeat and prevent all the machinations and contrivances that avarice and envy may put mana upon to the detriment of his neighbour are almost infinite would you be convincd of these truths do but employ yourself for a month or two in surveying and minutely examining into every art and science every trade handicraft and occupation that are professd and followd in such a city as london and all the laws prohibitions ordinances and restrictions that have been found absolutely necessary to hinder both private men and bodies corporate in so many different stations first from interfering with the publick peace and welfare secondly from openly wronging and secretly overreaching or any other way injuring one another if you will give yourself this trouble you will find the number of clauses and provisos to govern a large flourishing city well to be prodigious beyond imagination and yet every one of them tending to the same    purpose the curbing restraining and disappointing the inordinate passions and hurtful frailties of man you will find moreover which is still more to be admired the greater part of the articles in this vast multitude of regulations when well understood to be the result of consummate wisdom hor how could these things exist if there had not been men of very bright parts and uncommon talents cleo among the things i hint at there are very     few that are the work of one man or of one generation the greatest part of them are the product the joynt labour of several ages remember what in our third conversation i told you concerning the arts of shipbuilding and politeness  the wisdom i speak of is not the offspring of a fine understanding or intense thinking but of sound and deliberate judgment acquired from a long experience in business and a multiplicity of observations by this sort of wisdom and length of time it may be brought about that there shall be no greater difficulty in governing a large city than pardon the lowness of the simile there is in weaving of stockings hor a very low indeed cleo yet i know nothing to which the laws and establishd oeconomy of a wellorderd city may be more justly compared than the knittingframe the machine at    first view is intricate and unintelligible yet the effects of it are exact and beautiful and in what is produced by it there is a surprizing regularity but the beauty and exactness in the manufacture are principally if not altogether owing to the happiness of the invention the contrivance of the engine for the greatest artist at it can furnish us with no better work than may be made by almost any scoundrel after half a years practice hor tho your comparison be low i must own that it very well illustrates your meaning cleo whilst you spoke i have thought of another which is better it is common now to have clocks that are made to play several tunes with great exactness the study and labour as well as trouble of disappointments which in doing and undoing such a contrivance must necessarily have cost from the beginning to the end are not to be thought of without astonishment there is something analogous to this in the government of a flourishing city that has     lasted uninterrupted for several ages there is no part of the wholesome regulations belonging to it even the most trifling and minute about which great pains and consideration have not been employd as well as length of time and if you will look into the history and antiquity of any such city you will find that the changes repeals additions and a   mendments that have been made in and to the laws and ordinances by which it is ruled are in number prodigious but that when once they are brought to as much perfection as art and human wisdom can carry them the whole machine may be made to play of itself with as little skill as is required to wind up a clock and the government of a large city once put into good order the magistrates only following their noses will continue to go right for a great while tho there was not a wise man in it provided that the care of providence was to watch over it in the same manner as it did before hor but supposing the government of a large city when it is once establishd to be very easy it is not so with whole states and kingdoms is it not a great blessing to a nation to have all places of honour and great trust filld with men of parts and application of probity and virtue cleo yes and of learning moderation frugality candour and affability look out for such as fast as you can but in the mean time the places cant stand open the offices must be served by such as you can get hor you seem to insinuate that there is a great scarcity of good men in the nation cleo i dont speak of our nation in particular but of all states and kingdoms in general what i would say is that it is the interest of every nation to have their home    government and every branch of the civil administration so wisely contrivd that every man of midling capacity and reputation may be fit for any of the highest posts     hor thats absolutely impossible at least in such a nation as ours for what would you do for judges and chancellours cleo the study of the law is very crabbed and very tedious but the profession of it is as gainful and has great honours annexd to it the consequence of this is that few come to be eminent in it but men of tolerable parts and great application and whoever is a good lawyer and not noted for dishonesty is always fit to be a judge as soon as he is old and grave enough to be a lord chancellour indeed requires higher talents and he ought not only to be a good lawyer and an honest man but likewise a person of general knowledge and great penetration but this is but one man and considering what i have said of the law and the power which ambition and the love of gain have upon mankind it is morally impossible that in the common course of things among the practicioners in chancery there should not at all times be one or other fit for the seals hor must not every nation have men that are fit for publick negotiations and persons of great capacity to serve for envoys ambassadors and plenipotentiaries must they not   0have others at home that are likewise able to treat with foreign ministers cleo that every nation must have such people is certain but i wonder that the company you have kept both at home and abroad have not convinced you that the things you speak of require no such extraordinary qualifications among the people of quality that are bred up in courts of princes all midling capacities must be persons of address and a becoming boldness which are the most useful talents in all conferences and negotiations hor in a nation so involved in debts of different kinds and loaded with such a variety of taxes as ours is to be thoroughly acquainted with all the funds and the appropriations of them must be a science     not to be attaind to without good natural parts and great application and therefore the chief management of the treasury must be a post of the highest trust as well as endless difficulty cleo i dont think so most branches of the publick administration are in reality less difficult to those that are in them than they seem to be to those that are out of them and are strangers to them if a jack and the weights of it were out of sight a sensible man unacquainted with that matter would be very much puzled if he was to account    for the regular turning of two or three spits well loaded for hours together and it is ten to one but he would have a greater opinion of the cook or the scullion than either of them deserved in all business that belongsa to the exchequer the constitution does nine parts in ten and has taken effectual care that the happy person whom the king shall be pleasd to favour with the superintendency of it should never be greatly tired or perplexd with his office and likewise that the trust the confidence that must be reposed in him should be very near as moderate as his trouble by dividing the employments in a great office and subdividing them into many parts every mans business may be made so plain and certain that when he is a little used to it it is hardly possible for him to make mistakes and again by careful limitations of every mans power and judicious cheques upon every bodys trust every officers fidelity may be placed in so clear a light that the moment he forfeits it he must be detected it is by these arts that the weightiest affairs and a vast multiplicity of them may be managed with safety as well as dispatch by ordinary men whose highest good is wealth and pleasure and that the utmost regularity may be observed in a great office and every part of it at the same time that the whole oeconomy of it seems     to be intricate and perplexd to the last degree not only to strang   ers but the greatest part of the very officers that are employd in it hor the oeconomy of our exchequer i own is an admirable contrivance to prevent frauds and encroachments of all kinds but in the office which is at the head of it and gives motion to it there is greater latitude cleo why so a lord treasurer or if his office be executed by commissioners the chancellour of the exchequer are no more lawless and have no greater power with impunity to embezle money than the meanest clerk that is employd under them hor is not the kings warrant their discharge cleo yes for sums which the king has a right to dispose of or the payment of money for uses directed by parliament not otherwise and if the king who can do no wrong should be imposed upon and his warrant be obtaind for money at random whether it is appropriated or not contrary to or without a direct order of the legislature the treasurer obeys at his peril hor but there are other posts or at least there is one still of higher moment and that requires a much greater and more general capacity than any yet named cleo pardon me as the lord chancellours is the highest office in dignity so the execution of it actually demands greater and more uncommon abilities than any other whatever     hor what say you to the prime minister who governs all and acts immediately under the king cleo there is no such officer belonging to our constitution  for by this the whole administration is for very wise reasons divided into several branches     hor but who must give orders and instructions to admirals generals governours and all our ministers in foreign courts who is to take care of the kings interest throughout the kingdom and of his safety cleo the king and his council without which royal authority is not supposd to act superintend and govern all and whatever the monarch has not a mind immediately to take care of himself falls in course to that part of the administration it belongs to in which every body has plain laws to walk by as to the kings interest it is the same with that of the nation his guards are to take care of his person and there is no business of what nature soever that can happen in or to the nation which is not within the province and under the inspection of some one or other of the great officers of the crown that are all known dignifyd and distinguishd by their respective titles and amongst them i can assure you there is no such name as prime minister hor but why will you prevaricate with me after this manner you know yourself    and all the world knows and sees that there is such a minister and it is easily proved that there always have been such ministers and in the situation we are i dont believe a king could do without when there are     a great many disaffected people in the kingdom and parliamentmen are to be chosen elections must be lookd after with great care and a thousand things are to be done that are necessary to disappoint the sinister ends of malecontents and keep out the pretender things of which the management often requires great penetration and uncommon talents as well as secrecy and dispatch cleo how sincerely soever you may seem to speak in defence of these things horatio i am sure from your principles that you are not in earnest i am not to judge of the exigency of our affairs but as i would not pry into the conduct or scan the actions of princes and their ministers so i pretend to justify or defend no wisdom but that of the constitution itself hor i dont desire you should only tell me whether you dont think that a man who has and can carry this vast burden upon his shoulders and all europes business in his breast must be a person of a prodigious genius as well as general knowledge and other great abilities cleo that a man invested with so much real power and an authority so extensive as    such ministers generally have must make a great figure and be considerable above all other subjects is most certain but it is my opinion that there are always fifty men in the kingdom that if employd would be fit for this post and after a little practice shine in it to one who is equally qualifyd to be a lord high chancellor of great britain a prime minister has a vast an unspeakable advantage barely by being so and by every bodys knowing him to be and treating him as such a man who in every office and every branch of it throughout the admimstration has the power as well as the liberty to ask and see whom and what he pleases has more knowledge within his reach and can speak of every thing     with greater exactness than any other man that is much better versd in affairs and has ten times greater capacity it is hardly possible that an active man of tolerable education that is not destitute of a spirit nor of vanity should fail of appearing to be wise vigilant and expert who has the opportunity whenever he thinks fit to make use of all the cunning and experience as well as diligence and labour of every officer in the civil administration and if he has but money enough and will employ men to keep up a strict correspondence in every part of the kingdom he can remain ignorant of nothing and there is hardly any affair or transaction civil or military fo   reign or domestick which he will not be able greatly to influence when he has a mind either to promote or obstruct it hor there seems to be a great deal in what you say i must confess but i begin to suspect that what often inclines me to be of your opinion is your dexterity in placing things in the light you would have them seen in and the great skill you have in depreciating what is valuable and detracting from merit cleo i protest that i speak from my heart hor when i reflect on what i have beheld with my own eyes and what i still see every day of the transactions between statesmen and politicians i am very well assured you are in the wrong when i consider all the stratagems and the force as well as finesse that are made use of to supplant and undo prime ministers the wit and cunning industry and address that are employd to misrepresent all their actions the calumnies and false reports that are spread of them the ballads and lampoons that are publishd the set speeches and studyd invectives that are made against them when i consider i say and reflect on these things and every thing else that is said and done either to ridicule or   0 to render them odious i am convinced that to defeat so much art and strength and disappoint so much malice and    envy as prime ministers are generally attackd with require extraordinary talents no man of only common prudence and fortitude could maintain himself in that post for a twelvemonth much less for many years together tho he understood the world very well and had all the virtue faithfulness and integrity in it therefore there must be some fallacy in your assertion cleo either i have been deficient in explaining myself or else i have had the misfortune to be misunderstood when i insinuated that men might be prime ministers without extraordinary endowments i spoke only in regard to the business itself that province which if there was no such minister the king and council would have the trouble of managing hor to direct and manage the whole machine of government he must be a consummate statesman in the first place cleo you have too sublime a notion of that post to be a consummate statesman is the highest qualification human nature is capable of possessing to deserve that name a man must be well versed in ancient and modern history and thoroughly acquainted with all the courts of europe that he may know not only the publick interest in every nation but likewise the private views as well as inclinations virtues and vices of princes and ministers of every country in    christendom and the borders of it he ought to know the product and geography the principal cities and fortresses and of these the trade and manufactures their situation natural advantages strength and number of inhabitants he must have read men as well as books and perfectly well understand human nature and the use of the passions he must moreover be a great master in concealing the sentiments of his heart have an entire command     over his features and be well skilld in all the wiles and stratagems to draw out secrets from others a man of whom all this or the greatest part of it may not be said with truth and that he has had great experience in publick affairs cannot be calld a consummate statesman but he may be fit to be a prime minister tho he had not a hundredth part of those qualifications as the kings favour creates prime ministers and makes their station the post of the greatest power as well as profit so the same favour is the only bottom which those that are in it have to stand upon the consequence is that the most ambitious men in all monarchies are ever contending for this post as the highest prize of which the enjoyment is easy and all the difficulty in obtaining and preserving it we see accordingly that the accomplishments i spoke of to make a statesman are neglected and others aimd at and studyd that are more useful and more easily    acquired the capacities you observe in prime ministers are of another nature and consist in being finishd courtiers and thoroughly understanding the art of pleasing and cajoling with address to procure a prince what he wants when it is known and to be diligent in entertaining him with the pleasures he calls for are ordinary services asking is no better than complaining therefore being forced to ask is to have cause of complaint and to see a prince submit to the slavery of it argues great rusticity in his courtiers a polite minister penetrates into his masters wishes and furnishes him with what he delights in without giving him the trouble to name it every common flatterer can praise and extol promiscuously every thing that is said or done and find wisdom and prudence in the most indifferent actions but it belongs to the skilful courtier to set fine glosses upon manifest imperfections and make every failing every frailty of his prince have the real appearance of the virtues that     are the nearest or to speak more justly the least opposite to them by the observance of these necessary duties it is that the favour of princes may be long preservd as well as obtaind whoever can make himself agreeable at a court will seldom fail of being thought necessary and when a favourite has once established himself in the good opinion of his master it is easy for  00him to make his own family engross the kings ear and keep every body from him but his own creatures nor is it more difficult in length of time to turn out of the administration every body that was not of his own bringing in and constantly be tripping up the heels of those who attempt to raise themselves by any other interest or assistance a prime minister has by his place great advantages over all that oppose him one of them is that no body without exception ever filld that post but who had many enemies whether he was a plunderer or a patriot which being well known many things that are laid to a prime ministers charge are not credited among the impartial and more discreet part of mankind even when they are true as to the defeating and disappointing all the envy and malice they are generally attackd with if the favourite was to do all that himself it would certainly as you say require extraordinary talents and a great capacity as well as continual vigilance and application but this is the province of their creatures a task divided into a great number of parts and every body that has the least dependance upon or has any thing to hope from the minister makes it his business and his study as it is his interest on the one hand to cry up their patron magnify his virtues and abilities and justify his conduct on the other to exclaim against his ad 0 versaries blacken their reputation and play at them every engine and the samea stratagems that are made use of to supplant the minister     hor then every wellpolishd courtier is fit to be a prime minister without learning or languages skill in politicks or any other qualification besides cleo no other than what are often and easily met with it is necessary that he should be a man at least of plain common sense and not remarkable for any gross frailties or imperfections and of such there is no scarcity almost in any nation he ought to be a man of tolerable health and constitution and one who delights in vanity that he may relish as well as be able to bear the gaudy crouds that honour his levées the constant addresses bows and cringes of solicitors and the rest of the homage that is perpetually paid him the accomplishment he stands most in need of is to be bold and resolute so as not to be easily shockd or ruffled if he be thus qualifyd has a good memory and is moreover able to attend a multiplicity of business if not with a continual presence of mind at least seeniingly without hurry or perplexity his capacity can never fail of being extolld to the skies hor you say nothing of his virtue nor his honesty there is a vast trust put in a prime minister if he should be covetous and  0 have no probity nor love for his country he might make strange havock with the publick treasure cleo there is no man that has any pride but he has some value for his reputation and common prudence is sufficient to hinder a man of very indifferent principles from stealing where he would be in great danger of being detected and has no manner of security that he shall not be punishd for it hor but great confidence is reposed in him where he cannot be traced as in the money for secret services of which for reasons of state it may be often improper even to mention much more to scrutinize into the particulars and in negotiations with other courts should he be only swayd by selfishness and     private views without regard to virtue or the publick is it not in his power to betray his country sell the nation and do all manner of mischief cleo not amongst us where parliaments are every year sitting in foreign affairs nothing of moment can be transacted but what all the world must know and should any thing be done or attempted that would be palpably ruinous to the kingdom and in the opinion of natives and foreigners grosly and manifestly clashing with our interest it would raise a general clamour and throw the minister into dangers which no man of the least prudence who intends  0 to stay in his country would ever run into as to the money for secret services and perhaps other sums which ministers have the disposal of and where they have great latitudes i dont question but they have opportunities of embezling the nations treasure but to do this without being discoverd it must be done sparingly and with great discretion the malicious overlookers that envy them their places and watch all their motions are a great awe upon them the animosities between those antagonists and the quarrels between parties are a considerable part of the nations security hor but would it not be a greater security to have men of honour of sense and knowledge of application and frugality preferrd to publick employments cleo yes without doubt hor what confidence can we have in the justice or integrity of men that on the one hand shew themselves on all occasions mercenary and greedy after riches and on the other make it evident by their manner of living that no wealth or estate could ever suffice to support their expences or satisfy their desires besides would it not be a great encouragement to virtue and merit if from the posts of honour and profit all were to be debarrd and excluded that     either wanted capacity or were enemies to business all the selfish ambitious vain and voluptuous  0  cleo no body disputes it with you and if virtue religion and future happiness were sought after by the generality of mankind with the same sollicitude as sensual pleasure politeness and worldly glory are it would certainly be best that none but men of good lives and known ability should have any place in the government whatever but to expect that this ever should happen or to live in hopes of it in a large opulent and flourishing kingdom is to betray great ignorance in human affairs and whoever reckons a general temperance frugality and disinterestedness among the national blessings and at the same time sollicites heaven for ease and plenty and the encrease of trade seems to me little to understand what he is about the best of all then not being to be had let us look out for the next best and we shall find that of all possible means to secure and perpetuate to nations their establishment and whatever they value there is no better method than with wise laws to guard and entrench their constitution and contrive such forms of administration that the commonweal can receive no great detriment from the want of knowledge or probity of ministers if any of them should prove less able or honest than they could wish them the publick administration must always go forward it is a ship that can never lie at anchor the most knowing the most virtuous  0 and the least selfinterested ministers are the best but in the mean time there must be ministers swearing and drunkenness are crying sins among seafaring men and i should think it a very desirable blessing to the nation if it was possible to reform them but all this while we must have sailors and if none were to be admitted on board of any of his majestys ships that had sworn above a thousand oaths or had been drunk above ten times in their lives i am     persuaded that the sea service would suffer very much by the wellmeaning regulation hor why dont you speak more openly and say that there is no virtue or probity in the world for all the drift of your discourse is tending to prove that cleo i have amply declared my self upon this subject already in a former conversation and i wonder you will lay again to my charge what i once absolutely denied i never thought that there were no virtuous or religious men what i differ in with the flatterers of our species is about the numbers which they contend for and i am persuaded that you your self in reality dont believe that there are so many virtuous men as you imagine you do hor how come you to know my thoughts better than i do my self cleo you know i have tried you upon this head already when i ludicrously extolld and  0 set a fine gloss on the merit of several callings and professions in the society from the lowest stations of life to the highest it then plainly appeard that tho you have a very high opinion of mankind in general when we come to particulars you was as severe and every whit as censorious as my self i must observe one thing to you which is worth consideration most if not all people are desirous of being thought impartial yet nothing is more difficult than to preserve our judgment unbiassd when we are influencd either by our love or our hatred and how just and equitable soever people are we see that their friends are seldom so good or their enemies so bad as they represent them when they are angry with the one or highly pleasd with the other for my part i dont think that generally speaking prime ministers are much worse than their adversaries who for their own interest defame them and at the same time move heaven and earth to be in their places let us look     out for two persons of eminence in any court of europe that are equal in merit and capacity and as well matchd in virtues and vices but of contrary parties and whenever we meet with two such one in favour and the other neglected we shall always find that whoever is uppermost and in great employ has the applause of his party and if things go tollerably well his friends will attribute every good  0 success to his conduct and derive all his actions from laudable motives the opposite side can discover no virtues in him they will not allow him to act from any principles but his passions and if any thing be done amiss are very sure that it would not have happend if their patron had been in the same post this is the way of the world how immensely do often people of the same kingdom differ in the opinion they have of their chiefs and commanders even when they are successful to admiration we have been witnesses our selves that one part of the nation has ascribd the victories of a general entirely to his consummate knowledge in martial affairs and superlative capacity in action and maintaind that it was impossible for a man to bear all the toils and fatigues he underwent with alacrity or to court the dangers he voluntarily exposd himself to if he had not been supported as well as animated by the true spirit of heroism and a most generous love for his country these you know were the sentiments of one part of the nation whilst the other attributed all his successes to the bravery of his troops and the extraordinary care that was taken at home to supply his army and insisted upon it that from the whole course of his life it was demonstrable that he had never been buoyd up or actuated by any other  0 principles than excess of ambition and an insatiable greediness after riches hor i dont know but i may have said so my self     but after all the duke of marlborough was a very great man an extraordinary genius cleo indeed was he and i am glad to hear you own it at last   virtutem incolumem odimus   sublatam ex oculis quærimus invidi  hor a propos i wish you would bid them stop for two or three minutes some of the horses perhaps may stale the while cleo no excuses pray you command here besides we have time enough —— do you want to go out hor no but i want to set down something now i think of it which i have heard you repeat several times i have often had a mind to ask you for it and it always went out of my head again it is the epitaph which your friend made upon the dukea cleo of marlborough  with all my heart have you paper hor ill write it upon the back of this letter and as it happens i mended my pencil this morning how does it begin cleo   qui belli aut pacis virtutibus astra petebant  0  hor well cleo   finxerunt homines sæcula prisca deos hor i have it but tell me a whole distich at a time the sense is clearer cleo   quæ martem sine patre tulit sine matre minervam   illustres mendax græcia jactet avos hor that is really a happy thought courage and conduct just the two qualifications he excelled in whats the next     cleo   anglia quem genuit jacet hâc homo conditus urnâ   antiqui qualem non habuere deum hor —i thank you they may go on now i have seen several things since first i heard this epitaph of you that are manifestly borrowd from it was it never publishd cleo i believe not the first time i saw it was the day the duke was buried and ever since it has been handed about in manuscript but i never met with it in print yet hor it is worth all his fable of the bees in my opinion cleo if you like it so well i can shew you a translation of it lately done by a gentleman of oxford if i have not lost it it only takes in the first and last distich which in  0deed contain the main thought the second does not carry it on and is rather a digression hor but it demonstrates the truth of the first in a very convincing manner and that mars had no father and minerva no mother is the most fortunate thing a man could wish for who wanted to prove that the account we have of them is fabulous cleo oh here it is i dont know whether you can read it i copied it in haste hor very well   the grateful ages past a god declard   who wisely councild or who bravely ward   hence greece her mars and pallas deifyd   made him the heros her the patriots guide   ancients within this urn a mortal lies   shew me his peer among your deities it is very good cleo very lively and what is aimd at in the latin is rather more clearly expressd in the english   0 hor you know i am fond of no english verse but miltons  but dont let this hinder our conversation cleo i was speaking of the partiality of mankind in general and putting you in mind how differently men judgd of actions according as they liked or disliked the persons that performd them     hor but before that you was arguing against the necessity which i think there is for men of great accomplishments and extraordinary qualifications in the administration of publick affairs had you any thing to add cleo no at least i dont remember that i had hor i dont believe you have an ill design in advancing these notions but supposing them to be true i cant comprehend that divulging them can have any other effect than the increase of sloth and ignorance for if men may fill the highest places in the government without learning or capacity genius or knowledge theres an end of all the labour of the brain and the fatigue of hard study cleo i have made no such general assertion but that an artful man may make a considerable figure in the highest post of the administration and other great employments without extraordinary talents is certain as to consummate statesmen i dont believe there ever were three persons upon earth at the same time that deservd that name there is not a quarter of the wisdom solid knowledge or intrinsick worth in the world that men talk of and compliment one another with and of virtue or religion there is not an hundredth part in reality of what there is in appearance     hor i allow that those who set out from no better     motives than avarice and ambition aim at no other ends but wealth and honour which if they can but get any ways they are satisfied but men who act from principles of virtue and a publick spirit take pains with alacrity to attain the accomplishments that will make them capable of serving their country and if virtue be so scarce how come there to be men of skill in their professions for that there are men of learning and men of capacity is most certain cleo the foundation of all accomplishments must be laid in our youth before we are able or allowd to chuse for ourselves or to judge which is the most profitable way of employing our time it is to good discipline and the prudent care of parents and masters that men are beholden for the greatest part of their improvements and few parents are so bad as not to wish their offspring might be well accomplishd the same natural affection that makes men take pains to leave their children rich renders them sollicitous about their education besides it is unfashionable and consequently a disgrace to neglect them the chief design of parents in bringing up their children to a calling or profession is to procure them a livelihood what promotes and encourages arts and sciences is the reward money and honour and thousands of    perfections are attaind to that would have had no existence if men had been less proud or less covetous ambition avarice and often necessity are great spurs to industry and application and often rouse men from sloth and indolence when they are grown up whom no persuasions or chastisement of fathers or tutors made any impression upon in their youth whilst professions are lucrative and have great dignities belonging to them there will always be men that excell in them in a large polite nation therefore all sorts of learning will ever abound whilst the people flourish rich parents and such as can afford it seldom fail bringing up their children     to literature from this inexhaustible spring it is that we always draw much larger supplies than we stand in need of for all the callings and professions where the knowledge of the learned languages is required of those that are brought up to letters some neglect them and throw by their books as soon as they are their own masters others grow fonder of study as they increase in years but the greatest part will always retain a value for what has cost them pains to acquire among the wealthy there will be always lovers of knowledge as well as idle people every science will have its admirers as men differ in their tastes and pleasures and there is no part of learning but some body or other will look into it and labour at it from    no better principles than some men are foxhunters and others take delight in angling look upon the mighty labours of antiquaries botanists and the vertuosos in butterflies cockleshells and other odd productions of nature and mind the magnificent terms they all make use of in their respective provinces and the pompous names they often give to what others who have no taste that way would not think worth any mortals notice curiosity is often as bewitching to the rich as lucre is to the poor and what interest does in some vanity does in others and great wonders are often produced from a happy mixture of both is it not amazing that a temperate man should be at the expence of four or five thousand a year or which is much the same thing be contented to lose the interest of above a hundred thousand pounds to have the reputation of being the possessor and owner of rarities and knicknacks in a very great abundance at the same time that he loves money and continues slaving for it in his old age it is the hopes either of gain or reputation of large revenues and great dignities that promote learning and when we say that any calling art or science is not encouraged     we mean no more by it than that the masters or professors of it are not sufficiently rewarded for their pains either with honour or profit the most holy functions are no exception to what i say and    few ministers of the gospel are so disinterested as to have a less regard to the honours and emoluments that are or ought to be annexd to their employment than they have to the service and benefit they should be of to others and among those of them that study hard and take uncommon pains it is not easily proved that many are excited to their extraordinary labour by a publick spirit or solicitude for the spiritual wellfare of the laity on the contrary it is visible in the greatest part of them that they are animated by the love of glory and the hopes of preferment neither is it uncommon to see the most usefula parts of learning neglected for the most trifling when from the latter men have reason to hope that they shall have greater opportunities of shewing their parts than offer themselves from the former ostentation and envy have made more authors than virtue and benevolence men of known capacity and erudition are often labouring hard to eclipse and ruin one anothers glory what principle must we say two adversaries act from both men of unquestionable good sense and extensive knowledge when all the skill and prudence they are masters of are not able to stifle in their studyd performances and hide from the world the rancour of their minds the spleen and animosity they both write with against one another     hor b i dont say that such act from principles of virtue cleo yet you know an instance of this in two grave divines  men of fame and great merit of     whom each would think himself very much injured should his virtue be calld in question hor when men have an opportunity under pretence of zeal for religion or the publick good to vent their passion they take great liberties what was the quarrel cleo   de lanâ caprinâ  hor a trifle i cant guess yet cleo about the metre of the comick poets among the ancients hor i know what you mean now the manner of scanding and chanting those verses cleo can you think of any thing belonging to literature of less importance or more useless hor not readily cleo yet the great contest between them you see is which of them understands it best and has known it the longest this instance i think hints to us how highly improbable it is tho men should act from no better principles than envy avarice and ambition that when learning is once establishd any part of it even the most unprofitable should ever be neglected in such a large opulent nation as ours is where there are so many places of    honour and great revenues to be disposed of among scholars hor but since men are fit to serve in most places     with so little capacity as you insinuate why should they give themselves that unnecessary trouble of studying hard and acquiringa more learning than there is occasion for cleo i thought i had answerd that already a great many because they take delight in study and knowledge hor but there are men that labour at it with so much application as to impair their healths and actually to kill themselves with the fatigue of it cleo not so many as there are that injure their healths and actually kill themselves with hard drinking which is the most unreasonable pleasure of the two and a much greater fatigue but i dont deny that there are men who take pains to qualify themselves in order to serve their country what i insist upon is that the number of those who do the same thing to serve themselves with little regard to their country is infinitely greater mr hutcheson who wrote the inquiry into the original of our ideas of beauty and virtue seems to be very expert at weighing and measuring the quantities of affection benevolence c  i wish that curious metaphysician would     give himself the trouble at his leisure to weigh two things    separately first the real love men have for their country abstracted from selfishness secondly the ambition they have of being thought to act from that love tho they feel none i wish i say that this ingenious gentleman would once weigh these two asunder and afterwards having taken in impartially all he could find of either in this or any other nation shew us in his demonstrative way what proportion the quantities bore to each other —— quisque sibi commissus est says seneca  and certainly it is not the care of others but the care of itself which nature has trusted and charged every individual creature with when men exert themselves     in an extraordinary manner they generally do it to be the better for it themselves to excel to be talkd of and to be preferrd to others that follow the same business or court the same favours hor do you think it more probable that men of parts and learning should be preferrd than others of less capacity cleo cæteris paribus i do hor then you must allow that there is virtue at least in those who have the disposal of places cleo i dont say there is not but there is likewise glory and real honour accruing to patrons for advancing men of merit and if a person who has a good living in his gift bestows it upon a very able man every body    applauds him and every parishioner is counted to be particularly obliged to him a vain man does not love to have his choice disapprovd of and exclaimd against by all the world any more than a virtuous man and the love of applause which is innate to our species would alone be sufficient to make the generality of men and even the greatest part of the most vicious always chuse the most worthy out of any number of candidates if they knew the truth and no stronger motive arising from consanguinity friendship interest or something else was to interfere with the principle i named hor but methinks according to your system those should be soonest preferrd that can best coax and flatter cleo among the learned there are persons of art and address that can mind their studies without neglecting the world these are the men that know how to ingratiate themselves with persons of quality employing to the best advantage all their parts and industry for that purpose do but look into the lives and the deportment of such eminent men as we have been speaking of and you will soon discover the end and advantages they seem to propose to themselves     from their hard study and severe lucubrations when you see men in holy orders without call or necessity hovering about the courts of princes when you see them continually addressing and scrap  0ing acquaintance with the favorites when you hear them exclaim against the luxury of the age and complain of the necessity they are under of complying with it and at the same time you see that they are forward nay eager and take pains with satisfaction in their way of living to imitate the beau monde as far as it is in their power that no sooner they are in possession of one preferment but they are ready and actually solliciting for another more gainful and more reputable and that on all emergencies wealth power honour and superiority are the things they grasp at and take delight in when i say you see these things this concurrence of evidences is it any longer difficult to guess at or rather is there room to doubt of the principles they act from or the tendency of their labours hor i have little to say to priests and do not look for virtue from that quarter cleo yet youll find as much of it among divines as you will among any other class of men but every where less in reality than there is in appearance no body would be thought insincere or to prevaricate but there are few men tho they are so honest as to own what they would have that will acquaint us with the true reason why they would have it therefore the disagreement between the words and actions of men is at no time more conspicuous than when we would learn from them their sentiments con   cerning the real worth of things virtue is without doubt the most valuable treasure which man can be possessd of it has every bodys good word but where is the country in which it is heartily embraced præmia si tollas  money on     the other hand is deservedly calld the root of all evil there has not been a moralist nor a satyrist of note that has not had a fling at it yet what pains are taken and what hazards are run to acquire it under various pretences of designing to do good with it as for my part i verily believe that as an accessary cause it has done more mischief in the world than any one thing besides yet it is impossible to name another that is so absolutely necessary to the order oeconomy and the very existence of the civil society for as this is entirely built upon the variety of our wants so the whole superstructure is made up of the reciprocal services which men do to each other how to get these services performd by others when we have occasion for them is the grand and almost constant sollicitude in life of every individual person to expect that others should serve us for nothing is unreasonable therefore all commerce that men can have together must be a continual bartering of one thing for another the seller who transfers the property of a thing has his own interest as much at heart as the buyer who purchases that property and if you    want or like a thing the owner of it whatever stock or provision he may have of the same or how greatly soever you may stand in need of it will never part with it but for a consideration which he likes better than he does the thing you want which way shall i persuade a man to serve me when the service i can repay him in is such as he does not want or care for no body who is at peace and has no contention with any of the society will do any thing for a lawyer and a physician can purchase nothing of a man whose whole family is in perfect health money obviates and takes away all those difficulties by being an acceptable reward for all the services men can do to one another hor but all men valuing themselves above their   0 worth every body will overrate his labour would not this follow from your system cleo it certainly would and does but what is to be admired is that the larger the numbers are in a society the more extensive they have rendred the variety of their desires and the more operose the gratification of them is become among them by custom the less mischievous is the consequence of that evil where they have the use of money whereas without it the smaller the number was of a society and the more strictly the members of it in supplying their wants would confine themselves to those only that    were necessary for their subsistance the more easy it would be for them to agree about the reciprocal services i spoke of but to procure all the comforts of life and what is calld temporal happiness in a large polite nation would be every whit as practicable without speech as it would be without money or an equivalent to be used instead of it where this is not wanting and due care is taken of it by the legislature it will always be the standard which the worth of every thing will be weighd by there are great blessings that arise from necessity and that every body is obliged to eat and drink is the cement of civil society let men set what high value they please upon themselves that labour which most people are capable of doing will ever be the cheapest nothing can be dear of which there is great plenty how beneficial soever it may be to man and scarcity inhances the price of things much oftener than the usefulness of them hence it is evident why those arts and sciences will always be the most lucrative that cannot be attaind to but in great length of time by tedious study and close application or else require a particular genius not often to be met with it is likewise evident to whose lot in all societies the hard and dirty labour which no body would meddle with if he could help it will     ever fall but you have seen enough of this in the fable of the bees     hor i have so and one remarkable saying i have read there on this subject which i shall never forget the poor says the author have nothing to stir them up to labour but their wants which it is wisdom to relieve but folly to cure  cleo i believe the maxim to be just and that it is not less calculated for the real advantage of the poor than it appears to be for the benefit of the rich for among the labouring people those will ever be the least wretched as to themselves as well as most useful to the publick that being meanly born and bred submit to the station they are in with chearfulness and contented that their children should succeed them in the same low condition inure them from their infancy to labour and submission as well as the cheapest diet and apparel when on the contrary that sort of them will always be the least serviceable to others and themselves the most unhappy who dissatisfyd with their labour are always grumbling and repining at the meanness of their condition and under pretence of having a great regard for the welfare of their children recommend the education of them to the charity of others and you shall always find that of this latter class of poor the greatest part are idle sottish people that leading dissolute lives themselves are neglectful of their families and only want as far as it is in their power to shake off the    burden of providing for their brats from their own shoulders hor i am no advocate for charityschools yet i think it is barbarous that the children of the labouring poor should be for ever pinnd down they and all their posterity to that slavish condition and that those who are meanly born what parts or genius     soever they might be of should be hinderd and debarrd from raising themselves higher cleo so should i think it barbarous if what you speak of was done any where or proposed to be done but there is no degree of men in christendom that are pinnd down they and their posterity to slavery for ever among the very lowest sort there are fortunate men in every country and we daily see persons that without education or friends by their own industry and application raise themselves from nothing to mediocrity and sometimes above it if once they come rightly to love money and take delight in saving it and this happens more often to people of common and mean capacities than it does to those of brighter parts but there is a prodigious difference between debarring the children of the poor from ever rising higher in the world and refusing to force education upon thousands of them promiscuously when they should be more usefully employd as some of the rich must come to be poor so some of the poor will come to    be rich in the common course of things but that universal benevolence that should every where industriously lift up the indigent labourer from his meanness would not be less injurious to the whole kingdom than a tyrannical power that should without a cause cast down the wealthy from their ease and affluence let us suppose that the hard and dirty labour throughout the nation requires three millions of hands and that every branch of it is performd by the children of the poor illiterate and such as had little or no education themselves it is evident that if a tenth part of these children by force and design were to be exempt from the lowest drudgery either there must be so much work left undone as would demand three hundred thousand people or the defect occasiond by the numbers taken off must be supplyd by the children of others that had been better bred     hor so that what is done at first out of charity to some may at long run prove to be cruelty to others cleo and will depend upon it in the compound of all nations the different degrees of men ought to bear a certain proportion to each other as to numbers in order to render the whole a wellproportiond mixture and as this due proportion is the result and natural consequence of the difference there is in the qualifications of men and the    vicissitudes that happen among them so it is never better attained to or preservd than when no body meddles with it  hence we may learn how the shortsighted wisdom of perhaps wellmeaning people may rob us of a felicity that would flow spontaneously from the nature of every large society if none were to divert or interrupt the stream hor i dont care to enter into these abstruse matters what have you further to say in praise of money cleo i have no design to speak either for or against it but be it good or bad the power and dominion of it are both of vast extent and the influence of it upon mankind has never been stronger or more general in any empire state or kingdom than in the most knowing and politest ages when they were in their greatest grandeur and prosperity and when arts and sciences were the most flourishing in them therefore the invention of money seems to me to be a thing more skilfully adapted to the whole bent of our nature than any other of human contrivance there is no greater remedy against sloth or stubbornness and with astonishment i have beheld the readiness and alacrity with which it often makes the proudest men pay homage to their inferiors it purchases all services and cancels all debts nay it does more for when a person is employd in his occupation and he who sets him to work a good     pay   master how laborious how difficult or irksome soever the service be the obligation is always reckoned to lie upon him who performs it hor dont you think that many eminent men in the learned professions would dissent from you in this cleo i know very well that none ought to do it if ever they courted business or hunted after employment hor all you have said is true among mercenary people but upon noble minds that despise lucre honour has a far greater efficacy than money cleo the highest titles and the most illustrious births are no security against covetousness and persons of the first quality that are actually generous and munificent are often as greedy after gain when it is worth their while as the most sordid mechanicks are for trifles the year twenty has taught us how difficult it is to find out those noble minds that despise lucre when there is a prospect of getting vastly  besides nothing is more universally charming than money it suits with every station the high the low the wealthy and the poor whereas honour has little influence on the mean slaving people and rarely affects any of the vulgar but if it does money will almost every where purchase honour nay riches of themselves are an honour to all those who know how    to use them fashionably honour on the contrary wants riches for its support without them it is a dead weight that oppresses its owner and titles of honour joynd to a necessitous condition are a greater burden together than the same degree of poverty is alone for the higher a mans quality is the more considerable are his wants in life but the more money he has the better he is able to supply the greatest extravagancy of them lucre is the best restorative in the world in a literal     sense and works upon the spirits mechanically for it is not only a spur that excites men to labour and makes them in love with it but it likewise gives relief in weariness and actually supports men in all fatigues and difficulties a labourer of any sort who is paid in proportion to his diligence can do more work than another who is paid by the day or the week and has standing wages hor dont you think then that there are men in laborious offices who for a fixd salary discharge their duties with diligence and assiduity cleo yes many but there is no place or employment in which there are required or expected that continual attendance and uncommon severity of application that some men harrass and punish themselves with by choice when every fresh trouble meets with a new recompence and you never saw   0men so entirely devote themselves to their calling and pursue business with that eagerness dispatch and perseverance in any office or preferment in which the yearly income is certain and unalterable as they often do in those professions where the reward continually accompanies the labour and the fee immediately either precedes the service they do to others as it is with the lawyers or follows it as it is with the physicians——— i am sure you have hinted at this in our first conversation yourself hor heres the castle before us cleo which i suppose you are not sorry for hor indeed i am and would have been glad to have heard you speak of kings and other sovereigns with the same candor as well as freedom with which you have treated prime ministers and their envious adversaries when i see a man entirely impartial i shall always do him that justice as to think that if he is not in the right in what he says at least he aims at truth the more i examine your sentiments by what i see in the world the more i am obliged to     come into them and all this morning i have said nothing in opposition to you but to be better informd and to give you an opportunity to explain yourself more amply i am your convert and shall henceforth look upon the fable of the bees very differently from what i did for tho in    the characteristicks the language and the diction are better the system of mans sociableness is more lovely and more plausible and things are set off with more art and learning yet in the other there is certainly more truth and nature is more faithfully copied in it almost every where cleo i wish you would read them both once more and after that i believe youll say that you never saw two authors who seem to have wrote with more different views my friend the author of the fable to engage and keep his readers in good humour seems to be very merry and to do something else whilst he detects the corruption of our nature and having shewn man to himself in various lights he points indirectly at the necessity not only of revelation and believing but likewise of the practice of christianity manifestly to be seen in mens lives hor i have not observd that which way has he done it indirectly cleo by exposing on the one hand the vanity of the world and the most polite enjoyments of it and on the other the insufficiency of human reason and heathen virtue to procure real felicity for i cannot see what other meaning a man could have by doing this in a christian country and among people that all pretend to seek after happiness     hor and what say you of lord shaftsburya cleo first i agree with you that he was a man of erudition and a very polite writer he has displayd a copious imagination and a fine turn of thinking in courtly language and nervous expressions     but as on the one hand it must be confessd that his sentiments on liberty and humanity are noble and sublime and that there is nothing trite or vulgar in the characteristicks so on the other it cannot be denied that the ideas he had formd of the goodness and excellency of our nature were as romantick and chimerical as they are beautiful and amiable that he labourd hard to unite two contraries that can never be reconcild together innocence of manners and worldly greatness that to compass this end he favourd deism and under pretence of lashing priestcraft and superstition attackd the bible it self and lastly that by ridiculing many passages of holy writ he seems to have endeavourd to sap the foundation of all reveald religion with design of establishing heathen virtue on the ruins of christianity f i n i s             the i n d e xa  nb the roman figures refer to the preface a a belard page  0  absurd nothing is thought so that we have been used to     absurdities in

resulted evidently there was a shortage of the original sheet o either because of accident to both formes unlikely failure to print enough of sheet o originally or accident to the printed sheets which of the two sheet os is the first printing a clue to the answer is to be found in the figures numbers placed usually on the verso of some leaf in a sheet to indicate the division of labour among the presses see r w chapman printing     with figures in the library for       th ser iii    –  one sheet o is without figures  the other is figured in both formes—  on sign ov inner forme and   on sign o v outer forme let us inspect the rest of the book to see what bearing this matter of figures has in the body of the book we find four sheets with no figures two sheets h and x with two figures and the rest with one figure the preface—signed in halfsheets—has one figure—in the first halfsheet the index shows no figures in the case of the two sheets figured twice the two figures are identical for each sheet two  s in h two  s in x the presence of double figures therefore is evidently the result of accidental duplication only one press was used for both formes of sheets h and x the figured sheet o consequently is the only sheet of which the two formes were given to different presses examination of other books from the roberts establishment confirms the presumption that giving one sheet to two presses was an exceptional performance the figured sheet o accordingly seems to have been printed under unusual circumstances—circumstances such as might have been due to a sudden shortage of the original printing of sheet o such shortage indeed with the resultant need for hasty duplication of the sheet would be a very natural cause of dividing the sheet between two presses there is still another reason why the figured sheet is the later inspection of books of the period shows that the same volume often contained both figured and unfigured sheets it is very possible that several sheets were assigned to the same press each batch of sheets assigned to one press being figured once there was no need to figure each sheet since the press from which it issued could be identified by the one figured sheet in the group on the other hand for a sheet printed separately a figure would be more necessary thus it would be not unnatural for the first printing of sheet o to be without figures but abnormal for the second—and separate—printing to be without them i have therefore assumed the unfigured sheet o to be the original one and have adopted it for my basic text in some exemplars of this

why the single leaf and the last five leaves in each book should always be mates in order to save time the printer set up this single leaf and the last five leaves twice and printed with full sheets

berkeleys alciphron  0  criticisms of the fable this section—a supplement to chapter   of my introduction—analyses significant aspects of the arguments of some representative critics of mandeville paul sakmanns bernard de mandeville und die bienenfabelcontroverse freiburg leipsic and tübingen      contains additional outlines of the arguments of mandevilles opponents and may serve as a further supplement i have taken the opportunity offered here for incidental explanation of mandevilles positions william laws remarks upon a late book entituled the fable of the bees        this is the ablest of all the replies to mandeville and in some ways to be ranked as literature with the fable it is a masterpiece of controversial writing law was the opposite of a relativist mandevilles pyrrhonism which made ethics a matter of taste and custom and goodness an affair of the passions was abhorrent to him to law ethical truths were as immutable and definite as mathematical ones    moral virtue … is truth and reason considerd in relation to actions and the difference between one action and another is as immutable and eternal as the difference between one line and another and can no more be destroyd  0  as things are different by their own proper natures independant of our wills so actions have their own peculiar qualities from themselves and not from our thoughts about them in these immutable qualities of actions is founded the fitness and reasonableness of them which we can no more alter than we can change the proportions or relations of lines and figures p    here sir is the noble and divine origin of moral virtue it is founded in the immutable relations of things in the perfections and attributes of god and not in the pride of man or the craft of cunning politicians p    this was laws ultimatum the declaration of inalienable difference from mandeville the rejection by an absolutist of anything smacking of relativity in ethics virtue is of divine not human origin its criteria are fixed and simple not subject to the differences and mutability of purely human decisions with this as his basis and bias law now attacked mandeville in more detail and first animated by the desire to have his rules of eternal validity he attacked the account which mandeville had given of the origin of virtue he took literally the allegory in which mandeville described the foisting of virtue upon people through the playing of politicians upon their pride    the moral virtues are the political offspring which flattery begot upon pride fable i    he had of course no trouble in demonstrating that virtue is no such deliberate invention nor arbitrary imposition from without were not the first principles and reasons of morality connatural to us and essential to our minds there would have been nothing for the moral philosophers to have improvd upon pp   – 0 however mandeville would have been the first to admit that his allegory was not to be taken literally and that the growth of morality was a gradual one  of course he would have answered there were always in men the germs of morality for they were always the slaves of pride   on scriptural grounds  also law attacked mandevilles account of the origin of morality arguing that the rules of virtue are direct revelations from god he then left this phase of mandevilles thought for the kindred  0  matter of mandevilles antirationalistic reduction of all human conduct to the interplay of passions that we are rational beings law maintained p    is as plain as that we have bodies and bodily senses as there is no man so refind and elevated but gives frequent proof that he is subject also to instincts and passions so there is no one so addicted to an animal life as to shew no signs of an higher principle within him and pp  –  if man had nothing but instincts and passions he could not dispute about them for to dispute is no more an instinct or passion than it is a leg or an arm law here however was not quite facing mandevilles main point the important thing to mandeville was not that man lacks reason but that this reason for all its powers of logic cannot transcend the subrational desires of which according to mandeville it is merely the able servant law turned now from mandevilles empiricism to mandevilles contrary assertion that all the passions and their doings which he had shown so useful to humanity are nevertheless wicked this is the matter on which law concentrated the greatest dialectical effort and yet the paradox is that the position he here attacked was the development of a rigorism which he shared with mandeville it was one of laws most cherished doctrines that goodness was being virtuous upon principle and thro a love of goodness p    because of ones duty to god in the serious call laws rigorism was so extreme that he would not allow that a good man might ever act directly from a desire for pleasure yet law could not abide the paradox which mandeville drew from this rigorism—that under it virtue was impracticable and happiness wicked our conduct argued law is not rendered evil by the fact that our passions play their part in it an action is virtuous because it is an obedience to reason and the laws of god and does not cease to be so because the body is either formd by use or created by disposition easy and ready for the performance of it p    nor need our constant desire for happiness bar us from virtue on the contrary    happiness is the only reasonable end of every being … he who  0  thro long habits of goodness has made the practice of virtue to have less of selfdenial in it is the most virtuous man p    to believe otherwise would be to deny that god who does right in accord with his nature and desire is good p    thus by this attempted truce law tried to hold off the embarrassing consequences mandeville had inferred from the rigoristic code it should be noted however that fundamentally law was not deserting the creed of his serious call happiness to him could never be the direct incentive to good conduct unless perhaps when a man was so perfected that he derived his happiness from obeying the impersonal dictates of duty no other type of happiness could ever be a legitimate direct end of action though it might be a secondary motive or concomitant it may seem at first that in his vindication of natural motives law was making a telling point against mandevilles ethics he was however really once more agreeing with it mandeville would have had no objection to admitting that a man so exercised in doing good from a mere rational desire of being virtuous as to take pleasure in it was the best man law and mandeville were in absolute harmony as to their ideal but mandeville devoted the greater part of his work to a demonstration that this ideal is never realized god may do good in this manner but mere man never it was specifically with regard to the impossibility of realizing the ideal which he and law both professed that mandeville told his brilliant parable of small beer fable i    –  man as he really is in contradistinction to man as the moralists tell us he should be never does act as the moralists would have him if it be urgd said mandeville i     that if there are not it is possible there might be such virtuous people i answer that it is as possible that cats instead of killing rats and mice should feed them and go about the house to suckle and nurse their young ones or that a kite should call the hens to their meat as the cock does and sit brooding over their chickens instead of devouring em but if they should all do so they would cease to be cats and kites it is inconsistent with their natures and the species of creatures which now we mean when we name cats and kites would be extinct as soon as that could come to pass the disagreement then between law and mandeville was not in their formal creeds but in their belief as to the practicability of these creeds  0  and this kind of disagreement in agreement ran throughout all their thought the immutable criteria of right and wrong to which law clung mandeville ridiculed he admitted that virtue was action in accordance with them but believed that the search for them was a wildgoosechace it was the object of the fable to demonstrate the inevitable absence of what the william laws deemed necessary small wonder then that law was so excited by mandeville it was no consolation to have mandeville admit between roars of laughter that the world was a wicked place since he allowed of no escape from it such agreement was worse than none at all to law the evil in the world was not something to be calmly accepted it was the spur to find something higher to hold to laws despair of this world was a force which drove him to a belief in immutable moral criteria free from worldly taint by cleaving to which he could escape the evil of the world it made him cling closer to a belief in the existence of a divine perfection which would supply what the world lacked and in whose shelter the world might be defied in other words the recognition of preponderant evil demands the complementary recognition that there is a way of escaping that evil a man with laws views of the world had to find such salvation but mandeville denied all possibility of escape consequently the more mandeville insisted on the wickedness of the world the more horrible to law it was it was as if mandeville had kept shouting gleefully yes we are all drowning we are strangling in a sea of iniquity but nobody will throw us a rope and we couldnt catch it if some one did the real crux of the matter is that mandeville and law were speaking from the most opposite temperaments under their superficial agreement their whole feeling towards the world was different law really felt the distrust of the world which mandeville only announced mandeville did not feel it at all wicked or not the world was a good place to him leslie stephen half summed this matter up when he stated as mandevilles motto you are all yahoos …  and i am a yahoo and so—let us eat drink and be merry  this statement would be complete with the qualification that mandeville did not really feel that men are yahoos he simply recognized facts which caused people of another temperament to call men that  0  but to law the facts which mandeville recognized with such equanimity and the existence of anything besides which mandeville denied did mean that man was really a yahoo these facts were therefore insupportable to law and he refused to believe that they are the whole story he thought he saw a higher truth behind them it was therefore against mandevilles vision or rather against the basal attitude towards the world which allowed mandeville to be satisfied with this vision and not against his formal creed that law really rebelled richard fiddess general treatise of morality       fiddes was representative of that large class of clergymen who though orthodox were thoroughly permeated by the philosophy of the period which had made the deists his natural bent was not to a religion derived from revelation but to one arrived at by the human reason he acknowledged revelation to be sure but rather as a short cut to truth than as a necessity pp    –      sqq since his stress on the otherworldly element in religion was comparatively so faint he was not so outraged by mandeville as law was in fact he was one of the most civil of mandevilles contemporary opponents he found himself forced to admit the truth of almost every fact that mandeville insisted upon pp xix and lxxx but he contrived to wriggle out of mandevilles conclusions fiddes allowed that mandevilles reduction of human actions whether apparently virtuous or not to selfish passion had foundation but he argued that nevertheless people might act in accord with the desired ideal of virtue to show this fiddes first protested against the bias which he urged led mandeville where a motive was hidden always to posit a selfish one now where several motives may be reasonably assigned for any action it is more human more just and equitable to ascribe it to the best motives … p xx in the next place fiddes pleaded what might be called the argument from divinity god would not he maintained make demands upon  0  us for virtuous conduct which we could not fulfil pp xcii–xcv and cv–cviii fiddes was clearsighted enough to recognize that the paradoxical consequences mandeville deduced as to the necessity of vice depended on his unqualified ascetic rigorism and fiddes attacked this rigorism there is no reason he urged why an action should be vitiated because a man takes pleasure in it p xxii nor are all natural passions necessarily bad pp xxvi–xxvii to distinguish between good and evil passions and in general to oppose mandeville fiddes invoked a modified utilitarianism pp lx–lxiii xcv–xcviii cii in this way he attempted to evade mandevilles inferences as to the equal depravity of all conduct naturally possible to men but fiddess utilitarianism was after all for practical purposes only utility to him was the index of virtue the basal ethical sanction of conduct was that it was obedience to the supreme legislator p xcix indeed for all his practical utilitarianism fiddes was so far a rigorist as to hold it unlawful to commit a sin though he might thereby save the commonwealth ibid thus fiddes exemplified in a less startling manner the combination of the empirical and rigoristic attitudes which mandeville himself embodied john denniss vice and luxury publick mischiefs       john dennis was one of those who imagine that making a syllogism is the same as stating a truth the world was a table of classifications to him in which a was always a and never shaded into b and how is it possible for any man to conceive a ciceronian jackpudding he asked in one of his critical works  never was any buffoon eloquent or wise or witty or virtuous all the good and ill qualities of a buffoon are summd up in one word and that is a buffoon the remark is typical dennis thought of importance only that phase of things which could be formulated it was the generalization and not the concrete instance that interested him he was an extreme rationalist in his criticism of poetry  0  this took the form of a great stress on the importance to a poet of a thorough knowledge of the rules in his attack on mandeville it appeared in his statement that thought is certainly the only source of every human action as thinking rightly is the only source of every thing that is rightly done  one may imagine the feelings with which he regarded mandeville who maintained that men never act reasonably from their principles but that reason is the most utter tool of their passions and who intensified the antirationalism of this statement by a complete denial that those nice generalizations and principles of which dennis was so fond could ever be of more than the merest pragmatic value indeed along with law dennis was by nature the most contrasted of all types to mandeville just as the mystic law abhorred mandevilles happygolucky empiricism because it opposed a religious escape from this world of contrarieties and evanescence so dennis must have hated it because it equally opposed an escape from such a world through the reason dennis however did not know that this was a main reason for his fighting mandeville he arranged his attack on the most elaborate syllogistic lines his heavy artillery was the following logical sequence the original social contract is the basis of the english government it is only the explicit oath which the sovereign takes to observe the good of his country and the implicit one of the people to obey him which make english civilization possible now the keeping of these oaths depends on the sanctity which oaths in general have for people this sanctity like all other good p    is dependent upon their religion anything therefore which disturbs this religion shakes the reliability of these oaths and therefore all english civilization but mandeville threatens this religion ergo the fable of the bees has shaken the foundations of the kingdom pp ix sqq  most of the time dennis did not comprehend the matters he was attempting to refute he understood mandevilles statement that private vices are public benefits as if mandeville were using his terms with the ordinary connotations but of course what mandeville meant by private vice was not something practically disadvantageous to the individual but something wrong according to rigoristic morality  0  dennis especially attacked mandevilles defence of luxury as a public benefit this he did partly under a misconception as to what mandeville meant by luxury—correlative to his error as to what mandeville implied by vice—but largely also because of a real difference of attitude dennis believed in a spartan state he ransacked history to furnish examples of nations undone by the refinements of civilization predicted the ruin of england and pointed to the originating national debt as one of the luxuryengendered instruments of this impending calamity e g pp   –     sqq only for a moment did dennis have a glimpse of the fact that mandevilles paradox depended on his initial rigoristic definition this transient insight was in the matter of mandevilles denominating as luxury everything not essential to the barest needs of life and as dennis attempted to distinguish between luxurious and legitimate excess it is interesting to note that he was impelled to grasp for an instant at a utilitarian criterion pp   –  george bluets enquiry … in which the pleas offered by the author of the fable of the bees … are considered       this is by far the most painstaking of the answers to mandeville although i do not intend in this section to consider matters of practical policy it is worth recording that bluets book contains able criticism of mandevilles economic theories and of certain other practical aspects of his teaching a great part of bluets attack was based like that of almost all the controversialists on a too literal interpretation of mandeville but being one of the very ablest of these contenders he made a more effective use of his misinterpretation how foolish he argued were the politicians who according to mandeville brought virtue into being if vice is for the good of the community and likewise how stupid of our present magistrates to discourage wickedness since this   0 evil is our only salvation p    in this way bluet seized upon mandevilles statement that the laws should be enforced and that vices should be punished when they become prejudicial to the state to accuse him of inconsistency why punish such actions he asked since the more vicious the acts the greater the good to be expected from them the answer is that when mandeville spoke of virtue he meant socalled virtue which was to him simply a rearrangement of vicious passions so that he could advocate the usefulness of such virtue without denying the need of vice since such virtue is vice and when he advocated the suppression of vices inimical to society he was in opposition only to the theory that all vice is desirable which he had never seriously maintained mandevilles position was that some vice may by dexterous management be made useful and that this fraction of vice so used is indispensable as the world is constituted bluet however also had sight of more real issues in the fable he attacked the rigorism by which mandeville could after showing the necessity and practical benefit of the passions call them evil thus being able to make the paradox that vices are virtues he refused to accept mandevilles rigoristic definition of virtue and vice on which he saw the fable was built enquiry p    to the rigoristic demand for a complete perfection in morals from which mandeville inferred that our socalled good qualities are ethically futile because they have always some alloy of imperfection fable i    and     bluet answered p     … piety to parents is not the less a virtue because it may chance that a highwayman has relieved his parents in distress nor to put it yet stronger would be the less a virtue in itself though it should chance that a man robbd for this very purpose for if all his other qualities were answerable to this regard to his parents he would not have robbd but have acted in all things like a good man the passions in general said bluet are not intrinsically evil and their necessity to conduct is therefore no insuperable barrier to virtue pp   –  indeed the pleasure of doing an action is not only a legitimate stimulus it is the only motive human nature can act upon p    but how know whether a passion or an action is good or bad mandevilles rigoristic code condemned all natural conduct equally to make the necessary distinctions bluet like law     and fiddes had recourse to a utilitarian touchstone pp   –  this utilitarianism he elsewhere in his book p     crystallized into the form known as theological utilitarianism in which the rewards or penalties of the future life enter into the calculation of benefits but bluet also saw that the rigorism which he condemned in mandeville was only on the surface bluet realized that mandevilles real sentiments were that the passions whose management makes a state great and happy are justly to be encouraged and sympathized with that his rejection of them was merely verbal and superficial and that he would much regret it if the world were run according to rigoristic morality tis only to disguise his main design said bluet pp   –   that he employs his ingenious raillery in ridiculing fools who only strive   to make a great an honest hive that is for endeavouring at what is impossible to obtain his real sentiments appear when he calls the grumbling hive rogues and fools for having by their impertinent prayers procurd in fact such a state and condition of ascetic virtue and consequently such ruin and poverty the knaves are actually turned honest a curse which the great and good gods sent them in their vengeance as the greatest they could inflict … and again p    he does not … blame his grumbling hive for taking improper methods to root out vice but for rooting it out at all … what a fine consistent system of ethicks is this in this demonstration of mandevilles inconsistencies however bluet was objecting to a dualism of which he also was a victim as mandeville superimposed a rigoristic system on an attitude which bluet rightly felt to be antirigoristic so bluet assailed mandevilles rigorism while all the time bluet cherished the basal rigoristic principle … nothing can make a man honest or virtuous but a regard to some religious or moral principles enquiry p    —precisely the rigoristic position from which mandeville was arguing when he asserted that our socalled virtues were really vices because not based only on this regard to principle thus the author of the enquiry is still another illustration of the mingling of contradictory criteria which the fable itself embodies     berkeley and hervey      herveys some remarks on the minute philosopher was an attack upon berkeleys alciphron or the minute philosopher which was an attack on the fable of the bees yet both attacks agreed in one detail a point which was one of the most telling of all the criticisms passed upon mandevilles book hervey put it thus pp   –  i would have said that his mandevilles endeavouring to show that people do actions they have reason to be proud of from motives which if nicely scrutinized they would have reason to be ashamed of will never contribute to the multiplying such actions … if it could be proved that herostratus who fired the temple of ephesus and decius who threw himself for the sake of his country into the gulph that opend in rome acted both from the same motive and were equally influenced by the vanity of being mentioned in history and perpetuating their names to posterity …  if this i say could be demonstrated i would be glad to ask the author of the fable of the bees whether he thinks it would promote and encourage that virtue calld the love of ones country to shew that the most renownd patriot in antiquity and the most infamous incendiary were in the same way of thinking and actuated by the same passion berkeley stated this same objection as to the practical dangers of mandevilles theory of human nature whether true or not when he said ironically in answer to it it should seem then that platos fearing lest youth might be corrupted by those fables which represented the gods vicious was an effect of his weakness and ignorance  and it must be added that mandeville himself admitted the value of deceiving men into goodness  this argument is a crucial one it embodies an essential difference between toughminded thinkers such as mandeville and tenderminded ones like berkeley the latter combine an exalted ideal of virtue and humanity with a distrust of actual virtuousness and people as a result there arises a dual tendency—first always to subordinate the demands of the actual which they distrust to the ideal that they worship     which makes them rigorists in morality and secondly for their own comfort to persuade themselves into believing that their ideal is to be found actually embodied and is indeed the natural thing to expect it may seem a selfcontradiction that a distrust of actual humanity should be bound up with the belief that this distrusted humanity embodies the ideal in comparison with which it is contemned but it is none the less a fact it is a manifestation of the general tendency to believe that what is desired either actually exists or can be brought to pass on this account therefore berkeley could at once deny that men were so far from the ideal as mandeville asserted them to be and at the same time in the argument quoted above betray his complete want of confidence in this humanity by maintaining that they were so untrustworthy that they would be unable to withstand the deleterious effects of mandevilles disillusionizing doctrines the matter comes finally to this paradox that the berkeleys not only resented the denial by mandeville of their superlative conception of man but felt such distrust of this supposedly exalted creature that they feared for the practical ill effects which would follow mens conviction that they were not divine but the creatures of selfish passions mandeville realized the nature of the gulf between himself and berkeley in his reply to the bishops book he wrote letter to dion p    you sir think it for the good of society that human nature should be extolld as much as possible i think the real meanness and deformity of it to be more instructive the fact is that the cynical mandeville who spent his life telling how bad people were really felt enormously more confidence in them than the uncynical berkeley and this is why he was able to call them so many bad names and still be happy use every man according to his deserts and who should scape whipping asked hamlet and because he had berkeleys and not mandevilles temperament he was rendered miserable by this but mandeville said treat every one as he deserves and who shall escape hanging and continued on perfectly good terms with everybody he did not believe that men need in order to be tolerable to live up to the ideal deserts that hamlet and berkeley insisted upon that is why he refused to flatter them into morality and why he analysed motives in the way which hervey thought so dangerous mandeville had no such fear of     people as to feel the necessity of deceiving either himself or them as to their real nature indeed one might say that he abused mankind as we whimsically give bad names to good friends adam smith and john brown      and      adam smiths brilliant criticism is summed up in this culminating paragraph it is the great fallacy of dr mandevilles book to represent every passion as wholly vicious which is so in any degree and in any direction it is thus that he treats every thing as vanity which has any reference either to what are or to what ought to be the sentiments of others and it is by means of this sophistry that he establishes his favourite conclusion that private vices are public benefits if the love of magnificence a taste for the elegant arts and improvements of human life for whatever is agreeable in dress furniture or equipage for architecture statuary painting and music is to be regarded as luxury sensuality and ostentation even in those whose situation allows without any inconveniency the indulgence of those passions it is certain that luxury sensuality and ostentation are public benefits since without the qualities upon which he thinks proper to bestow such opprobrious names the arts of refinement could never find encouragement and must languish for want of employment some popular ascetic doctrines which had been current before his time and which placed virtue in the entire extirpation and annihilation of all our passions were the real foundation of this licentious system it was easy for dr mandeville to prove first that this entire conquest never actually took place among men and secondly that if it was to take place universally it would be pernicious to society by putting an end to all industry and commerce and in a manner to the whole business of human life by the first of these propositions he seemed to prove that there was no real virtue and that what pretended to be such was a meer cheat and imposition upon mankind and by the second that private vices were public benefits since without them no society could prosper or flourish  notice here that adam smith did not fall into the vulgar error of thinking that mandeville was confounding the practical effects of vice and calling all vice equally beneficial to society but that he attacked mandeville for making all actions equally reprehensible from a moral standpoint briefly he condemned mandevilles moral nihilism the     absence of any criterion to distinguish between moral good and evil except the impracticable and repulsive one of identifying virtue with complete selfdenial a similar indictment of mandeville was drawn up by john brown in his essays on the characteristics he also recognized that mandeville took advantage of an ethical system which contending for the permanent reality of virtue and not content to fix it on its proper basis attempts to establish certain absolute and immutable forms of beauty or virtue without regard to any further end … mandeville intent on destroying the permanent reality of virtue and vice and perceiving how weak a basis the noble writer shaftesbury had laid for their establishment after proving this to be imaginary as wisely as honestly infers there is no real one in nature essays ed      p     this according to brown was the cause of the absence of definite criteria in mandeville this is the reason why mandeville maintained that in morals there is no greater certainty than in the matter of whether fashionable society will prefer broadbrimmed or narrowbrimmed hats see fable i    –  but brown went further he tried to supply the deficiency which he and smith found in mandeville by offering utility as the missing test of moral truth he set up the great end of public happiness … as the one uniform circumstance that constitutes the rectitude of human actions pp   0–  by this means he thought to restore to ethics that certainty of which mandeville attempted to rob it without setting up the rigoristic creed which drove mandeville into this theft there are visible in this controversy roughly speaking two main kinds of criticism the first is that of men like law and berkeley who may be termed the religiousminded what they objected to primarily in mandeville was his refusal to recognize the existence of anything above human experience they rebelled at the manner in which he made morality an affair of the passions and denied the existence of any absolute standards of right and wrong the fact that mandeville formally admitted the necessity for action in accord with such standards did not reconcile these critics to him it simply enraged them the more since mandeville admitted their creed only     in order to show its impracticability as a result they usually in their anguish threw logic to the winds and criticized him for the most inconsistent reasons the same men would attack not only his basal empiricism but his acceptance of the rigoristic ethics in which they themselves believed appalled at the result of his adoption of their own code they turned upon it to rend themselves they complained because he called human nature bad but they really objected because he felt such utter reliance upon it they felt what he said and said what he felt the paradoxes in mandevilles book were at least equalled by those in the minds of his readers on the other hand were critics like adam smith and john brown these men were not roused to anger by mandevilles empiricism for they largely shared it still as it happens they objected to his teachings for reasons which superficially resemble the objections of men like law they condemned the rigorism which caused mandeville to identify selfgratification with vice and his failure to offer practical criteria according to which to determine moral values mandeville had simply said—although he did not really feel this—that all things were equally vicious smith and brown however objected to mandevilles asceticism for a very different reason from that of the other type of critic law and bluet for instance combated mandevilles asceticism because they felt that he did not really believe it but smith and brown objected because they thought that he did the latter wished a scheme of morals in which man should be the measure of all things and his happiness the end of conduct in this respect they were in harmony with what is really basic in mandevilles thought they were simply refining away that part of mandeville which is out of keeping with his own true trend it may be said then that the more they refuted mandeville the more they agreed with him the attack of such critics as smith and brown upon mandevilles pyrrhonism or denial of final criteria was also like their attack on his asceticism only in superficial agreement with the similar attack of thinkers like law both types of critics agreed in demanding some standard of moral values but whereas fiddes and law would have set up a code of divine origin whose ultimate sanction was not utilitarian the other critics wished a standard which should be quite relative to human needs brown for instance offered definitely a utilitarian scheme of ethics but in this as in their attack on mandevilles formal asceticism thinkers of smiths type were bringing out what     is latent in mandeville and attacked him because they did not realize that under his superficial difference he was really at one with them mandeville as is noted above i lviii–lxi being at bottom as utilitarian as john brown here too then the effect of this class of critics was not so much a refutation of mandevilles teachings as a development of them     references to mandevilles work

where there is difference the present edition is the more authoritative     lovejoy arthur o personal letter to me dated   march      i dont feel so sure as you do that mandeville adhered to what you call the rigoristic point of view his writing is so largely ironic that it is hard to be sure when he is serious but he strikes me as far too acute a writer not to have realized the logical consequences of his own most characteristic doctrine you yourself attribute to him above i cxxxiv n an explicitly utilitarian position … … you perhaps give to m a slightly greater place than belongs to him in the development of utilitarianism … the present edition modifies the claim made in the article—the influence of bernard mandeville—criticized by professor lovejoy ms chief significance i think lay not in his contribution to or influence upon the development of ethical theory but in his place in the history of what would nowadays be called social psychology in insisting upon the subrational determination of most if not all of our motives and in regarding the reasons which men give for their acts as largely a rationalizing explanation necessitated by selfesteem of these subconscious motivations he of course anticipated a very recent fashion in psychology but what is especially noteworthy about him is his recognition of the immense part played in human life and especially in what the sociologists lingo now calls social control of the passion which he calls pride or glory … he traced this spring of action and of feeling through its countless disguises and ramifications more subtly and recognized its pervasiveness more fully than any writer i know of before his time or for long after he clearly realized that it is the existence of this class of selfconscious desires which is the specific differentia of human nature and the point dappui of the moral appeal or of the control which society exercises over its members by means of what are commonly called moral influences adam smith of course afterwards carried out the same general idea with more detail and in a more constructive and less satirical spirit in his theory of the moral sentiments where the influence of mandeville is not less marked i think than in the wealth of nations nearly all of the fundamental ideas of mr thorstein veblens theory of the leisure class—regarded

published independently it may however have formed part of remarks upon two late presentments      if this work is as is very possible by mandeville as to its authorship see my article the writings of bernard mandeville in the journal of english and germanic philology for      xx    – 0 although the remarks dealt with both presentments by the grand jury of the fable the earlier portion of the remarks according to its own statement pp    and    related only to the first presentment and therefore could easily have been written two years before      and indeed seems to have been see remarks p    perhaps however the defence spoken of may have been worked into the origin of honour     and the letter to dion        in fable i  0    sir john fielding told hugh kelly that ever since the first representation of this piece in the same year mandeville signed this preface there had been on every successful run a proportionate number of highwaymen brought to the office… w cook memoirs of charles macklin ed   0  p    dr johnson gave some typically sane testimony on the other side in his life of gay   william law for instance in remarks upon a late book entituled the fable of the bees      pp   –  george bluet in his enquiry      p  0  and innes in apethλογια      p xxiii   see fable i     where mandeville tells the anecdote to which this passage is an allusion   throwing sticks at a cock tied to a stake was formerly a shrovetide pastime   shaftesbury had similarly stated the dangers of dialoguewriting if he the philosopher represents his philosophy as making any figure in conversation if he triumphs in the debate and gives his own wisdom the advantage over that of the world he may be liable to sound raillery   characteristics ed robertson   00 ii   shaftesbury had also given a defence of dialogues similar to that below in this paragraph see characteristics i       no such statement is found in plato or cicero professor paul shorey sends me the suggestion that mandeville was probably thinking of a somewhat similar statement made by plato in theaetetus     b c which cicero repeated in de amicitia     in his virgin unmaskd      p     mandeville had already referred unfavourably to the romantic hero of the conquest of granada a the om  0 a were      cf above i cv–cvi     n   and below ii     n   and     n   i find no such dialogues in gassendi   this is a device by which mandeville evades responsibility for unorthodox sentiments of the two speakers in the dialogues it is not always cleomenes who is mandevilles spokesman cleomenes frequent statement of belief in the biblical account of creation in the midst of his demonstration of the incompatibility of this account with a scientific explanation is an ironical pose as is his repeated invocation of miraculous providential intervention to explain history it is in horatios unorthodox disagreement with this that mandeville himself speaks this device is given away by his temporary unwillingness to sustain it in a passage ii    –  which inquires into the means by which primitive man contrived to survive the ravages of wild beasts at first cleomenes argues that this survival could be due only to providential interference but questioned further by the doubting horatio explains this interference away by interpreting it in terms of natural law a similar procedure is pursued in another passage ii   0–  such belief in the universality of natural law is mandevilles real tenet indeed horatio here ii   0 uses the very argument employed by mandeville in fable i     that providence works not without means wherever cleomenes argues otherwise then in the disingenuousness of his reasoning and the cogency of horatios answers as in ii  0 –  it is i think apparent that mandeville has his tongue in his cheek and that horatio is his real mouthpiece   the bonfire on this occasion was for queen carolines birthday see below ii    n     see fable i       the comedian or philosophic enquirer numb ix for      pp  0–  gives this account of the fraud—an apocryphal account according to mandeville see below ii       the booksellers … hired a fellow whom they dressed like a gentleman to go up to the fire with the fable of the bees in his hand and to declare to the mob that he was the author thereof    this story i had from a bookseller in paternosterrow a man of worth and honour to whom one of the scoundrels who hired the fellow to personate dr mandeville was weak enough to relate the fact … i am mistaken if those very persons who hired the fellow did not likewise pyrate the edition of the answer to the fable … apparently this anecdote about the burning of the fable became current an essay satirizing the effects of whistons prophecies noted in its imaginary record of the endoftheworld scenes inspired by a general belief in these prophecies that at st brides church in fleetstreet mr woolston who writ against the miracles of our saviour in the utmost terrors of conscience made a public recantation dr mandeville who had been groundlessly reported formerly to have done the same did it now in good earnest at st jamess gate prose works of jonathan swift ed temple scott iv       for instance in the london evening post   –   mar      p  and in the whitehall evening post   –   mar      p     like mandeville machiavelli held that man judged by christian ethics is naturally evil and that the social order must be based on this unidealistic fact cf il principe ch    and    machiavelli too believed christianity unconductive to worldly greatness because christianity leads its devotees to stimare meno lonore del mondo opere milan   0  ii     in discorsi    ii and because a prince must often operare contro alla fede contro alla carità contro alla umanita contra alla religione il principe ch    for three other parallels see above i    n      n   and    n   these parallels however are scarcely enough to show mandeville indebted to machiavelli   as to hobbes spinoza and bayle see above i cix–cxi and ciii–cv   the two people who protested most abusively against the immorality of mandevilles doctrines were both of them notorious the guilt of hendley cf below ii     who was tried for embezzling charity funds was doubtful but there is no doubt about innes— the near relation of brigadier lauder who was governor of sluys innes first appears accompanying the scottish regiment garrisoned there while at sluys he met george psalmanazar who was then hardly more than a boy psalmanazar claimed to be a native of formosa concerning which he invented such sensational anecdotes that he managed to arouse popular interest in himself he had besides a genius for the impromptu invention of languages innes although knowing him for a cheat realized that he might make capital of psalmanazar and opened communication with the bishop of london expecting a preferment from the bishop as the reward for converting psalmanazar from his supposed formosan heathenry and introducing him for ethnological study into england he therefore baptized psalmanazar coached him in his fraud and took him to england the experiment was a success and innes was made chaplaingeneral to the english forces in portugal whither he departed just in time to avoid being turned for a second time out of his lodgings because of immorality meanwhile he was made a doctor of divinity by a scottish university some time after in      innes met his countryman professor archibald campbell in london and the latter entrusted him with a manuscript to place with a publisher innes did place it with a publisher but as his own work with the title of apethλογια—adding a preface in which he attacked mandeville as a result of this book the bishop of london gave him a good living in essex in    0 campbell reappeared on the scene and as he put it made innes tremble in his shoes inness cousin stuart physician to the queen interceded however and campbell was persuaded to be satisfied with an advertisement stating his authorship which read only that for some certain reasons the book had appeared as inness even this was delayed so that innes could remove to his benefice in essex before it appeared it was time anyhow for him to give up his assistant preachership at st margarets westminster for he was discovered to have been guilty of malversation there the remainder of his life was spent very privately according to psalmanazar who adds that he hopes that innes made the best use of his solitude see memoirs of  commonly known by the name of george psalmanazar ed      pp     sqq

translated in      under the title of the art of painting the preface called a parallel of poetry and painting was by dryden it is from this preface that mandeville almost literally cited the material

had done in addition queen caroline had long been händels patroness and he was the princesses musicmaster   there were two kinds of recitativo in mandevilles day the recitativo secco which was

and deeper and deeper still from his jephthah   in this satire on the conventions forbidding realism in the arts mandeville may have been not only indirectly preparing the defence of his psychological

attacked mandevilles theory that all conduct is motivated by selflove without however referring specifically to mandeville the principle we call selflove never seeks any thing external for the sake of the thing but only as a means of happiness or good particular affections rest in the external things themselves … such affections are not to be resolved into selflove … and if because every particular affection is a mans own and the pleasure arising from its gratification his own pleasure … such particular affection must be called selflove according to this way of speaking no creature whatever can possibly act but merely from selflove and every action and every affection whatever is to be resolved up into this one principle but then this is not the language of mankind or if it were we should want words to express the difference between the principle of an action proceeding from cool consideration that it will be to my own advantage and an action suppose of revenge or of friendship by which a man runs upon certain ruin to do evil or good to another it is manifest the principles of these actions are totally different and so want different words to be distinguished by all that they

the rules of poetry in two countries according to the several humours of nations are sometimes as different as the languages themselves so that the faults of the one are often beauties in the other

lxxiii–lxxv he showed certain superficial resemblances to mandeville with mandeville he argued that our knowledge comes a posteriori through sensation and perception and also like mandeville he was a pioneer of the english utilitarian movement unlike mandeville however he held that sensation and perception were sufficient foundation for absolute truth the universal harmony of nature being arranged to this end and also unlike mandeville he maintained that we were endowed with a moral sense capable of leading us inevitably to correct moral judgements without invoking the utilitarian test this moral sense he held to be of divine origin a part of the eternal harmony thus being in opposition to mandeville who is throughout an opponent of the divine original of virtue hutchesons utilitarianism too was in a way only skin deep the hedonistic test was to him merely an index of correct action he refused to make this test also the sanction of its virtue and being thus convinced that divine ordinance and practical utility are always at one he could when the latter seemed to shock his moral sensibilities ignore it and adopt the common and convenient dialectic artifice of saying that what here seemed useful was not truly so because it violated the divine ordinance thus he tended to consider as lacking in virtuousness such actions however advantageous as proceeded from selfish motives mandeville therefore who attempted the proof that the most useful actions are consistently prompted by selfishness was here again galling hutchesons philosophic kibe it was in demonstrating the existence of the moral sense and the intricacy of the divine harmony as embodied in man that hutcheson indulged in the weighing and measuring the quantities of the emotions to which mandeville ironically alludes this weighing hutcheson did by actual mathematical formulae thus he expressed benevolence as b  m−ia or b  mia inquiry p   0   cf seneca epist cxxi    bk  0 ep   §     juvenal
