a farther continuation of the history of the crowninn  partiii  containing the present state of the inn and other particulars  london printed for j moor and sold by the booksellers of london and westminster price   d  a farther continuation of the history of the crowninn etc in my last i told you what furious pretentions were made to mr wrights favor by a set of fellows who you will conclude little deserve it and if you consider that the greatest part of that letter was writ before his coming to town you will likewise agree that i spoke somewhat like a prophet  but indeed what is easier than to foresee things which have such natural and unavoidable consequences for nothing but the grossest impudence as well as the most absurd and vain conceptions could have given them the least pretense to it or have urged them to hope what they were neither entitled to or qualified for  they were very officious in their attendance on mr wright when he arrived near the town and as suppliant as spaniels in their sycophantick devoires they feigned and wrung out an hundred compliments which he took littlenotice of but of all you would have laughed heartily at bob with his inviolable attach and boasted interest bob after all was fain to implore the favor to be introduced and when he had duckd himself into a low and obsequious cringe as he drew near mr wright by a sudden presence of mind turned his back upon him and poor bobs countenance fell like a weatherglass at the alteration of the weather  this admirable farce would have lasted much longer to the great diversion of the town but that mr wright who is the most free and unaffected man living and cannot endure any thing that looks like constraint or servile flattery resolved not to be pestered with em and therefore by dismissing jacob rush sim and some other of the king leaders designed to convince the rest what he thought of their company and that he was capable to distinguish those who had merited from him from those who had not  you will hardly believe me when i tell you that the curate had the impudence to appear publicly at the inn surely the front of that fellow must be of the most solid and obdurate brass can it be forgot how often he has drank young shutes health and preached up his interest by inumendos in direct opposition to mr wrights succession is any thing more notorious unless his own corrupt life than his encouraging his enemies both in life and doctrine how often has he been drunk at the popes head the crosskeys and mitre with the friends of young shute for he promotes no house that is not even in its very description well affected to him was this a wretch now to appear barefaced to mr wright or can any thing better discribe the unaccountable vanity of an unthinking termagant party  the conclusion of this was that the wretch was hustled out of the house and had been buffeted but out of deference to his coat can you divine now what should be in the mans head his friends indeed according to their usual vanity said we should see him a b  p but could even the most stupid clodpate alive really hope or believe this after he saw his confederates under the deplorable circumstances of disgrace and the interest entirely sunk that could support his unjust pretensions well of all the senceless furious creatures that breath in the open regions of the air commend me to the curate and his party for something very ridiculous and out of the common road and propriety of thinking  a friend of mine gives a very good turn to this and says it was a design of the party to send him thither on purpose to be affronted thereby to give a second handle to inflame the mob as at an injury or disrespect offered to the church and this to be sounded by the trumpets of zion among the people i will grant for once they may be capable to think for there are some shallow tricksters among them and therefore my friends notion may be just but if ever they are hanged for conjurers i will be shot or throw my self out of the window as an auspicious patron of his did when he remembered the irreparable injury he had done his country by charioting and countenancing such a pernicious incendiary  upon the whole the party have now changed their sentiments it is at length beaten into their fortified skulls that their mighty pretenses to mr wrights favor were frivilous and without ground they do not so warmly and proudly affirm now that they were the men who brought him in and all the love and previous grimaces and the faint acclamations before his arrival are turned into dull and insignificant shruggs  the glorious changes at the inn have almost worked them into their ancient spirit the consternation is great but they have always a body of reserve ready to sustain them under the most shocking and terrible defeats it is pleasant to hear these fellows who but a few days ago were heard to utter the most melodious things imaginable of mr wright now assume a dogmatical air of reasoning upon his conduct and straining themselves into ambiguous and ridiculous hints as if his known and celebrated virtue were any way in the case of discountenancing such a pack of deep mouthed curs that are always full cry in running down truth and innocence and where they have neither courage nor honesty to speak their minds are villains enough to make distant and raskally reflections but let them take care for we have a substantial pair of stocks here and a whippingpost of the fittest magnitude equal to the brawniest back of the most sizeable villain among them besides two sturdy young elms at the townsend that grew in a true protestant country where hereditary right slavery and arbitrary power were never heard off  i am vexed that i must trouble you with such trifles as these but i shall never get through my purpose without letting you into these little details nor would you be so capable to relish things more momentous if you were not truly possessed of the present state and litigious spirit of the party you remember what they were in power and it is proper you should know what they are in adversity  they forget the old proverb that sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander what havoc they made in turning out the old servants upon the most frivolous pretenses and what a scrabling they made to get their fingers into the widows dish never was such a set of cormorants known they devoured by wholesale yet went on with eager complaints against the old servants the better to conceal their own voracious stomachs one was accused of taking half penny rolls out of the bakers basket another for embezling the hay and oats and a third for receiving reckonings and not bringing the money to the bar but for truth they left that to be made out by jonathan wormwood their amanuensis a very bitter fellow against all the old servants a witty facetious varlet and a and hanger on to bob who kept him for such purposes for which he was excellently qualified for he was as wicked as his heart could wish and had the best talent at railery and lies a man could possibly be enduedwithal  how he handled the widows friends and servants you have heard already it was however equal to the justice and candor of all their other proceedings and helped to furnish half the blockheads in town of that party with matter to hold an argument some drew the whole rigmaro into a kind of useful common place for the greater ease to their memorys and every jackdaw or owl in town could hoot out some senceless lesson taken from his scurrilous memoirs  bob had half a dozen of these fellows at his beck who hated him heartily but for the bread they received out of the widows basket every raskal had his separate instructions to one it was given to blacken the widows friends and show the necessity of coming to an agreement without them to another to render our own condition desperate the better to frighten people into a sense of it a third was to run down the credit of the old servants and cry up the great honesty of the new a fourth to discant on the church a fifth on trade and a sixth incessantly to cry out faction plots wicked designs etc and keep the town in continual alarm to prevent their cooling or recovering their proper senses  these tools as infamous as they were answered the ends they were employed on the mob especially and the most unthinking and injudicious people were taken by the ears and listened to them with great attention and by such mountebank methods the credit of their proceedings at the inn was wholly supported  the widow poor woman they kept up in her chamber and persuaded her that her appearing below stairs might be prejudicial to her health and that every thing went on well and her customers appeared all very much pleased with their entertainment so that she seldom came into the bar unless now and then on a market day or so or at a clubsupper when it was necessary for her to pass some accounts the rogues had indeed some reason to say she was misled and abused by the old servants if they judged from the result of their own conduct for they found she was a perfect easy woman and if her tenants and customers were but pleased with their usage she seldom enquired further and they took special care that none of the old servants might come near her and stifled all letters by the post when they suspected the hand writing for fear she should get any intelligence of the true state of the house  they were taking all other methods they could think on to make the game sure when they differed among themselves about the means and to the great satisfaction of the town fell together by the ears nab like an ungrateful slut as she was had not that regard to the advancement bob had been a means to promote her to and perhaps there was something in it more than ordinary bob was on the decline aged fiftyfive and upwards of a temperate and phlegmatic constitution harry was in the meridian of his days a robust young dog full of life and fire with a vigorous shape strong back and hale complexion fed high and had an amorous soul of his own the rogue has good blood in his veins too but no more the son of old harry than i am of jupiter the old man disowns his proceedings and says he always feared he would come to some violent end from his turbulent disobedient spirit that his mother rest her soul dreamt of a comet the night she was delivered of him and could never govern him as he should be nay you must know the young knave took up a belt against his own father once at a wrestling and threw him out of the ring  but to proceed harry by these strong persuasions drew nab into his party not that she has many babies to be seen in her eyes for they have for some years past displayed but a very dull water yet the jade had a feeling conception of the foregoing qualifications and there was an excellent character stirring of his singular talent that way nab evesdropt dropped all that passed between the vvidow and bob and gave harry an account still and took all opportunities to improve things to his advantage for i should have told you that nab according to bobs prediction was by this time become a lady and i can assure you valued herself not a little upon it she looked as much above her former occupation as an upstart squire does above a hack when he has dipped the ancient seat for a gilt chariot and a pair of swiss tails nab was hand and glove with the vvidow and not a pin could be stuck right if it was not of nabs doing for nab had been well brought up and could handle her needle tiff up a fall below or do any other work as well as drudgery though the beesom was indeed the most exquisitely adapted to her hands of any other perquisite of her office nab kept the vvidows purse and bought perfumes powder and patches etc and made many a round penny of her markettings she had a liquorish tooth of her own and loved a cordial at her heart which she always posted in her bill of incidents they say twas pretty large at the vvidows death  there were other of the female servants at the inn violently attached to harrys person through the impression of his smug countenance and brawny shoulders no page could swallow quincemarmalet more greedily than these simpering baggages did the complimental addresses of the young brazier every one believing like don johns six wives that she was the woman and each putting herself forward with the greatest address to serve him and render him gracious in the eyes of the vvidow this it is to have the reputation of being what we call a womans man bob with all his politic airs and set faces could not conjure himself into the womens graces and harry had a favorable gift beyond all the magic of his wand harry would dance with them on the green play at dropglove stoolball and the like which bob was too feeble and stiff in the hams for and could only figh that he had introduced such a smockfaced young vvhoresbird to supplant him  thus you see by what measures harry carried his point and engaged the private services of these female advocates whose short triumph and sudden fall is now the subject of their tears and concern realy the fellow might be very happy could he but lay aside ambition and confine himself to a rural kind of life the great resort of females his reputation would soon draw about him could not but afford a very happy prospect of pleasure to one who is by nature fitlier qualified for the lacivious drudgery of a seraglio than the gravity of public business in short harrys a very pretty fellow and a boon companion but the rogue was so near sacrificing his country he is never to be trusted at the inn more if he comes off no worse  i must not forget that i promised you an account of the present state thereof i concluded with telling you of the several changes made at the inn and what was likely to ensue charles the headostler and ned topsail as i hinted are both restored to their places honest will truby has jostled that queer fellow jack squeamish out of his stewardship and frank stirrup son of old ralph the cashkeeper has received the keys of the coffer again from the reluctant hands of nabs enabled consort  every thing looks with a good aspect and the house begins to appear in its ancient grandeur you may remember in what a plight you left us solitary and disconsolate our credit sunk our trade cramped and ruined the country beggard and the inn in the hands of a set of arbritrary fellows that drove on jehulike to our destruction our friends affronted and discouraged honest men put out of all and none but a parcel of indefeasible raskals preferred who deserved hanging for their known zeal to young shute but you will now find us with smiling countenances cheerful spirits and composed minds we could hardly speak before for fear of our taskmasters but we dare now nose those villains that used to gibe us men of integrity are only looked on at the inn and to have been well attached to the new landlord is the best argument for present merit  robin bold the plummer dick filedust the smith nick silvertongue the lapidary and the rest of the honest lads that stood titely for him at the last wrestling are brought into play again and are ready to take up a cudgel on the same side whenever occasion offers they threaten us hard in some parts of the country but we have as good as carried the belt in this town already almost two to one and we doubt not but to show em fair play for it every where else we have a parcel of mettled lads that have been used to sport and are not afraid of a broken head or two if it comes to the push  you may remember i always told you things could not last long as they went on and it is confirmed what i told you in my first that the vvidow designed to have made great alterations at the inn had she recovered it is likewise as certain that they broke her heart among them by discovering one another rogueries when they fell out poor woman they had harrassd her so for   years together and made her break her words often with her honest friends and tenants that when she came once to reflect it cast her into such a deep melancholy as carried her precipitately to the grave in her last intervals she entered into the following soliloquy to this effect unhappy woman have i for this so long eat the bread of carefulness took pains early and late to promote a trade and gain reputation to the inn on purpose to make all thy tenants and customers easy and happy and is all my trouble and care come to this at last it was not so says she in the days of my old servants my affairs went well then and nothing i undertook but was successful i had a reputation far and near and was esteemed and courted even by my very adversaries my tenants and customers were perpetually rejoicing but i fear i have now given them too great an occasion for sorrow could i recall a little time but i shall never outlive it i would endeavor to remove the cause and make them all easy again but this is reserved for heaven and my successor tell my poor people i dye theirs and yet i am sorry i cannot do more to redress them before i depart this said she turned about and with a sigh breathed out her soul to him that gave it  were these fellows capable of correction sure this would have some effect on them but i despair of ever seeing them show the least signs of grace and repentance  you have heard how they would have insinuated themselves into mr wrights favor and what a fawning and cringing they used at first but when they saw he was not to be cajoled and made a very just distinction of their proceedings toward him by clearing the house of them they presently changed their notes and are forming a cabal against his conduct  the rewarding the long and eminent services of honest john trusty is one of the greatest cuts to em of all for though they bear the rest with spleen and impatience enough yet there is in this a double portion of acrimony john was the honor and support of the old servants and the terror and disgrace of the new john carried the cause against old savage for many years together to the great disadvantage of their idol young shute john refused to countenance their schemes in making the composition and rather chose to retire out of the country than breath the same air with such villains as seemed to have abandoned all faith and honor and were driving at the ruin of their country and if that raskal slyboots had nothing else to answer but the persecution and ill treatment of this worthy man that were enough never to have him forgiven  how easy it is to guess the rage and ferment these fellows are in at mr wrights glorious proceedings they say he begins too soon moves too fast and that this cannot last long with other such rediculous stuff but these are rather their wishes than their sentiments both which are as much below his resentment as the senceless reflection of the party he came here to govern and chose rather to show them that he saw no reason to conceal his resentment nor to continue men about him whom he could not choose but be uneasy at and if they have any modesty they ought to believe themselves obnoxious and make a silent retreat that there was more sincerity and justice in opening himself freely at first and letting them see he had no reason to disguise himself than to act in deference to their judgment or have any regard to the censure of people he had so little reason to value they mistake he has both too much courage and too much honesty to endeavor to veil his conduct or proceed with the least regard to their empty commendations hypocrisy was property a rather becoming the last three years than the prudence justice honor and excellent management of the new landlord whose rule is to reward his friends do justice to his enemies and fear none  they are endeavoring to possess the people that he designs to curtail the dignity of the inn by reducing the gates two foot narrower in circumference to prohibit the eating of beef abridge the servants wages and allow them only small beer at their victuals and finally that he intends to take down the steeple and employ the stones and rubbish to make a fence for the conventicle with other preposterous cant then to give terrible ideas of his person they represent him with a furious stern look and a head like a dragon with scales and fins like a fish and with such like incredible stuff endeavor to make an impression on the people but let them go on when they have lied till they are weary of it the banter will end in their own shame and confusion  i could enlarge egregiously on his admirable qualities the great temperance justice candor and moderation of his temper but i shall omit it till a more favorable opportunity having already almost filled up my scrole  i had almost forgot to tell you that some unlucky knaves in a picture spread privately about have drawn poor harry in deep mourning with the league in one hand and a halter in the other the hangman carrying an axe before him with the edge toward him in the upper copartment is the gallows hung in blackbayes for arthur skipkennel matt the tavernboy con and some of the rest of them etc i am yours etc  finis
