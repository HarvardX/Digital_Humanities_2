an essay on redemption by jesus christ  showing from scripture the character of our redeemer the nature of his redemption and the benefits arising from it to men  by j murray of newcastle  newcastle printed by t slack and sold by the booksellers in town and country       introduction a great part of the mistakes about religion have arisen from mens passing too suddenly from one object to another mankind naturally are disposed to proceed rapidly in their progress after truth and seldom come to the true knowledge of it by reason of not considering one thing before another the words of job may be fitly applied to mankind in general  for vain man would be wise though man is born like a wild asses colt job xi    notwithstanding we are dull in our capacities in learning the knowledge of truth yet we are ever ready to make too much haste and to stretch ourselves beyond our measure  passing too quickly from one thing to another we leave the former before we investigate its properties in seeking to become wise we become fools by stopping short in our enquiries before we understand any subject wisdom is not attained by the ordinary methods of seeking after her  we should search for her as for hid treasure we ought not to leave any truth before we have examined it on all sides and enquired into its various properties on purpose to understand the whole complex or particular notions included in its general character  how far it may be possible to know the several simple properties which are understood in general terms or universal propositions  it is necessary if we would understand things as they are in their several constitutions physical moral and oeconomical to examine the constitutions in which they are considered as parts of a whole by this means we shall be led to consider the various relations which constitutional ideas have to one another  which may be of singular service to us in the choosing terms to express either general or particular things by this means we shall proceed gradually from one property of any subject to another and be able to distinguish between primary and secondary truths and their qualities  and know what we are already in the possession of and what we ought to enquire after on purpose to consummate our knowledge  it is a great part of our present infelicity that we think we have knowledge when we have some perceptions  whereas perceptions are but the materials of knowledge or the steps by which we advance to understanding it is necessary that we judge our perceptions and compare them with those objects which we think we perceive otherwise what we call knowledge will be no more than a chaos of ill arranged perceptions huddled together without any order  one chief thing to be observed in all our pursuits after truth is analysis the almighty has seen meet to represent truth to men as it were in bundles and when they are well directed in their enquiries after it they proceed by analysis to find out the several simples contained in every concert but i must observe here that we know nothing of absolute simplicity things to us are only simple by being compared with other things that are more complex but we cannot say that we know any thing abstractly in a perfect sense our notions of simplicity are entirely formed from our notions of composition  and we call things simple that are farthest from some known compound every object meets us at first in a compounded or constitutional state  and our knowledge of constitutional truth consists in our being acquainted with the analysis of its constitution the several individual truths arranged in such a constitution when considered distinct from the rest are called simple  this i take to be all that is implied in our ideas of simplicity our notions of simplicity are therefore only relative  i shall observe before i proceed that all our knowledge of the divine nature and operations is founded upon a constitution of his government and we attain to that knowledge by being gradually let into the analysis of that constitution by unfolding the various parts and relations principles and ends of that constitution the deity makes his ways known to men  and the whole system of physical and moral truth as it relates to this constitution comes to be known by comparing those parts and relations the understanding of parts and their relations in natural philosophy may be called physical knowledge the understanding of relations and ends in morals may be called moral knowledge the term relation is truly no more than the condition of some object with regard to another in some system either as to connection or opposition relations are all the parts we possibly can conceive of in a moral system and in any moral constitution bear the same respect to one another that parts properly so called do in physics or natural philosophy  good and evil are to one another as heavy and light namely opposites  they are equally parts of the system they belong to the term part is relative and has a respect to a whole as the term good is relative and has a relation to evil they are only so systematically as far as we know what they are in themselves we cannot certainly say moral evil supposes some law and constitution of government  for where there is no law there is no transgression it can therefore be evil only systematically and cannot be conceived of out of a system the true knowledge of the constitution and system we belong to with all the various relations and dispensations thereof are taught us in revelation  the right knowledge of the scriptures is the true analysis of the divine government and administration which are profitable for all things to make the man of god perfect and to furnish him thoroughly for every good word and work   timothy iii     the plan of the divine government has never varied though the external administration thereof has been various at different times since the beginning of the world it argues the infinite capacity of the great author that he has supported an uniform plan of government amidst the various dispensations thereof among so many different nations and people  the first account we have of the conduct of the almighty toward man is that he made him after his own image and placed him under a law  which law he qualified him to obey by endowing him with powers suitable to the task he enjoined him the rest of the creatures were made subject to man as the representative of his maker in this lower world adam the first of our progenitors was entrusted with the administration of government in this world and was the vicegerent of his maker over all the creatures yet he himself was put under a law and made accountable to the great legislator of the universe he was gods chief minister under this first constitution  god who is possessed of infinite prescience could not but know what would be the issue of adams administration had therefore provided against all future contingencies yet saw meet to suffer a specimen to be handed down through all ages what the most perfect beings were liable to when left entirely to the exercise of their own liberty by permitting adam to betray his trust and suffering him to transgress that law he was placed under he has evidently shown that the most perfect human liberty yea angelic freedom cannot secure creatures in happiness without the divine care and agency to uphold them all human powers are created and need as much the concurrence of the power of god to support them in their exercises as it was necessary for their first existence for it is true in a moral as well as a natural sense that in him we live and move and have our being acts xvii     adam being the subject of his maker and his prime minister with respect to the creatures by breaking that positive law concerning the fruit of the forbidden tree lost his dominion over the creatures and became liable himself to suffer punishment because the law of that constitution threatened death in case of disobedience it is manifest from scripture that the first man being in a public character transmitted his guilt to his posterity for the apostle plainly declares that the judgment was by one to condemnation and that death reigned by one mans offense that by the offense of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation that by one mans disobedience many were made sinners romans v             it is plain from the apostles opinion of the first transgression that it brought both death and condemnation along with it how this was consistent with that constitution man at first was placed in and how it was just in the almighty to impute the sin of adam to his posterity may next fall under our consideration  here we must confine our views of justice to what was expressed in the law of the first constitution of man according to that law it was just for god to punish man with death and condemnation because his offense was treason against the divine government by affecting independency the offense was aggravated by man attempting to be like to god or rather independent upon him it was not merely a simple breach of trust but an attempt to usurp the throne of the almighty it was more than disobedience of the law that the almighty gave to adam  eating of that fruit at any rate might have deserved condemnation but to eat thereof to be as god was seeking to become deities as man had now taken part with beings who had already renounced the divine supremacy as far as they could it was but fit he should share in their punishment as far as the offense was similar  whenever adam should have children they could not but stand in a relation to him as a parent under forfeiture of happiness till such time as it should appear whether they would approve of their fathers misconduct or not  for the spirit of all laws says that the sons of traitors shall not have the inheritance their fathers have forfeited till once the government has some proof of their fidelity the imputation of the guilt of fathers to their children is implied in the spirit of all laws and interwoven with all forms of wise government but in case sons shall disapprove of their fathers conduct and approve themselves worthy of the notice of the sovereign it is but reasonable that they be taken under his protection and have the forfeiture removed which their parent brought upon their inheritance  but this is far from being the case with the seed of adam they became partakers of the same rebellious temper of mind that was in him and discover it as soon as they are able to do any thing  not to carry this point too far it was and is just in our great sovereign to impute the guilt of adams sin to all his posterity till they disapprove of his deed and testify their dislike of it by conformity to that law which he transgressed but shall none of his race disapprove of his conduct but walk in his very footsteps what does the spirit of all good laws say but that the children shall suffer even for the sin of their fathers and their own also i heartily agree with what the prophet says if a father beget a son that sees all his fathers sins which he has done and considers and does not such like if he walk in the statutes of life without committing iniquity he shall surely live he shall not die he shall not bear the iniquity of his father ezekiel xviii    and xxxiii    but where do we find among all the sons of adam such wise and considerate children do not they all go astray as soon as they are born and are estranged from the very womb the scripture account of all men as descendants of adam is there is none righteous no not one there is none that understands there is none that seeks after god they are all gone out of the way they are altogether become unprofitable there is none that does good no not one romans iii  0        adam and all his posterity were now justly accounted guilty by the law of their constitution they were first placed in both on account of the promise they despised and the authority of god they set at naught it would border upon profanity to say that the almighty placed man under a faulty constitution for it seems to have been as well calculated for free agents that are dependent as any thing could be to answer an end the most material objection that seem to have any weight in it is at the same time full of impiety namely that god ought to have prevented what he knew would so much tend to the hurt of his rational creatures  but not to mention the absurdity of saying what the almighty ought to have done we should rather conceive that god did things for the best  and more especially as it was through an abuse of the best of privileges that man ruined himself liberty is what all wise men account a valuable privilege and it is necessary to make rational creatures accountable and had man at first not been formed a free agent as far as a creature can be dependently free he could neither had merit nor demerit it is sufficient to say that god made man upright and neither impelled him to the one side or the other and as he had power to do good or evil he is justly accountable for the abuse of his liberty the only source of moral obligation is the divine will and seeing god declared that it was his pleasure that man should abstain from the fruit of the forbidden tree it was an act of the highest rebellion against god to gainsay his public declaration man was therefore condemned for a breach of moral obligation attended with the highest aggravations  it would be needless to say what man lost through his disobedience  the favor of his maker which is life and every other blessing that tends to happiness he forfeited by sinning against god it would be absurd to say that man could really enjoy life when he had lost the favor of his maker in which it consisted  what is therefore meant by death in the full extent of the word under this constitution is misery and pain as well as the dissolution of the body through mortality the fabric of this first constitution was totally ruined as far as it respected human happiness and the weight of its fall would have sunk the whole human race down to endless misery had not the almighty who knew all future events beforehand provided a remedy suitable to the breach made in that constitution this law which man was made under stood in full force against him and as it was the first public revelation of gods will to which he had annexed a threatening where his veracity was concerned for the sake of his public credit as the just governor of the universe he deals with all men according to this first revelation of his will this law covenant revelation or what you please to call it comes always first under consideration when the almighty deals with men  as this is really the case that the almighty begins with every man of adams posterity where their father ended and is obliged in honor to do so it appears plainly that by the deeds of the law no flesh living can be justified the almighty cannot in character depart from the first publication of his will and men cannot walk up to it since adam fell but fall miserably short in principles measure motives and ends  the consequence is they must either be miserable or some other scheme must be revealed suited to the character of god and the miserable condition of mankind the condition of mankind is very wretched through sin  they are in consequence of the justice and equity of god as a lawgiver expressed in that law given to man at first consigned over to death and condemnation  they are held fast by the fetters of prejudice and corrupt affections and have neither will nor inclination to do the will of god hence they are doubly in bondage  bound over to condemnation by the sanction of the law of god  and bound by their own corrupt affections as slaves to the god of this world whatever different theories men may have of this matter every man in fact feels the truth of this double bondage  which they plainly discover by fears at death and enmity to truth while they live  such is the state and condition of man that without a redeemer he can have no hope of happiness nor any real pleasure in this life  redemption by the blood of jesus christ is necessary to give hope of happiness to men and this shall now be considered  an essay on redemption chap i showing the nature of redemption according to scripture wherein it consists and what qualifications were requisite in the redeemer to accomplish it sect  st redemption in scripture signifies the buying back something that is lost alienated or mortgaged or it signfies deliverance from danger violence or oppression it is applied to persons or things to either the lives or estates of men it always has relation to some law of equity and moral justice that redemption which our lord jesus christ wrought for his people was also according to the law and justice of the first constitution which man was placed in it was observed in the introduction that the will of god is the source of moral obligation it was his revealed will that man should have kept that positive law he gave him in a state of innocence or in case he should transgress the precept that was given to him he should fall under the weight of the threatening and forfeit the favor of his maker in which his true life and happiness consisted for in the favor of the almighty is life yea it is in scripture said to be better than life in as much as moral satisfaction is better than mere creature existence the threatening implied what is death in a moral sense the want of friendship with god and in consequence thereof pain and bitter remorse of soul at the apprehension of the divine displeasure and the thoughts of future evil  the almighty placed our first parents under a very casy and equitable law  he laid no heavier burden upon them than a single prohibition to put them in mind of their dependence upon their maker he gave them all things richly to enjoy and did not sparingly distribute his bounty unto them only as was just he put them in mind of their dependence by withholding from them the fruit of a single tree while man kept the supremacy and moral character of god in his eye there was no danger of his breaking his law but he forgot that he was dependent and brake the law of his maker by affecting to be his equal by affecting independence upon god who made him he became like the beasts that perish the threatening pursued him fast for the lord drove out the man the presence of jehovah in which a perfect creature cannot but have the most exquisite pleasure became dreadful to minds so conscious of their guilt adam and his wife hid themselves from the lord god among the trees of the garden but boundless mercy which never had any motive but the sovereign pleasure from whence it flowed in due time revealed a savior and made known a reason of hope to man who had nothing in himself but every reason of despair a savior is promised and redemption through his blood  the seed of the woman shall bruise the serpents head but will god truly pass over the spirit and intention of his law to man and make void his own word and declaration in that positive affirmation of his holiness in the day that thou eatest thou shall die shall gods moral character as a righteous legislator suffer for the sake of man that is a worm and the son of man that is a worm this would expose the character of the god of truth and give reason for rebellious mortals to presume upon his mercy and goodness shall ever favor be bestowed upon guilty man it must be in consistency with that first revelation which god made to the world if sinners be saved and redeemed from sin and punishment it must be according to law  the law which jeaovah gave to his rational creature man was easy reasonable and light and could be no way hard or difficult to such perfect creatures as our first parents were  and as this first moral precept was an abstract of all righteousness and implied all the duties which dependence upon the almighty binds men to observe so no deed or action contrary to this law done by any in the nature of man could be lawful and right  and supposing this law either broken or strictly observed it was still the condition of life and happiness to the posterity of adam in keeping of it it is plain that life was the reward and in case it should be broken death should be the wages  the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life romans vi    upon supposition that man should transgress and be exposed to the curse of the law if any should be so wise mighty and merciful as to redeem him from his misery this law was still to come under the first consideration and the happiness to be obtained must be consistent with this abstract of the will of god  as gods moral character was concerned in this rule of righteousness and called in question by mans disobedience  so there was no other way known to us how his character and our salvation might be made consistent but by beginning where our first parents failed to have overlooked the first transgression of his law altogether would have represented mans duty not so necessary as god said it was when he annexed the threatening of death to disobedience  in the day thou eatest thereof thou shall surely die for suppose we ought not to attempt to limit the holy one of israel in the exercise of his attributes nor say what he might or could do  yet we may say according to what he has revealed to us in his word he could not have granted life to man without first having respect to his own holy character expressed in his law  as the judge of all the earth he must do right  whenever god intended to express his mercy and compassion toward miserable mortals it was necessary that his wisdom should devise a method whereby mercy and compassion might appear consistent with the truth of the divine threatening and the purity of the holy law we find from scripture that benevolence and wisdom are both conspicuous in the plan of mans happiness wisdom in contriving a scheme where there is the greatest goodwill to men and yet the divine law taken first into consideration benevolence in taking into consideration the case of enemies wretched and miserable and conferring favors upon them they never could have deserved this is clearly pointed out in the xl psalm ver   when sacrifice and offerings were not required jehovah the messiah says a body have thou prepared me i delight to do thy will o my god  thy law i have within my heart christ was made under the very same law which the first man transgressed he was made subject to all its precepts to obtain a title to eternal life to all his seed according to the covenant of promise and subjected to its curse to redeem them from temporal spiritual and eternal death  from temporal death as to its sting  from spiritual death as to its power  and from eternal death as to its nature degrees and consequences  the chief end of man was to glorify god by doing his will and christ had a special respect to this end  i delight to do thy will the redemption obtained by jesus christ and applied to believers is neither more nor less than a perfect fulfilling of the chief end of man  which was at first and still is to glorify god and to enjoy him for ever christ as our redeemer was made under the law of god in all its various forms in the fullness of time god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons gal iv    he was made under the law in that form in which it was revealed to our first parents both as to its commandment and curse  as a rule of righteousness it was the delight of his life  and he called it with all the other forms of it his fathers business he was made under the law of god in its ceremonial form as connected with the doctrine of all the prophets  for he came not to destroy the law and the prophets but to fulfill them matthew v     it would lead me from my subject to give instances of each of them  but in a word that redemption which our redeemer perfected was according to all the known forms of the divine law but more than all it was perfectly conformable to the spirit of the law of god the spirit of our saviors obedience was quite answerable to the intention and spirit of the law of god the principles and motives from whence he acted served and obeyed were holy just and pure  love to god and man were his devoted principles his motives were to glorify him that sent him to deliver his people from wrath and make them happy  his end to give such a representation of gods moral character to the world as should appear quite consistent with itself and the first revelation of god to man in the messiah those draughts of moral character mercy and truth righteousness and peace met together and in the most regular moral economy showed the justice of the divine proceedings and vindicated the ways of god to man whatever was intended by the spirit of the first law and revelation of the will of god was by our saviors redemption perfectly fulfilled  the best of men even when they observe the letter of the law of god are much defective as to the springs of action and fall much short of the spirit and design of gods holy commandment  but christ had the whole law in its largest extent and compass in his heart and could say with the strictest propriety i have respect to all thy commandments this redemption which jesus christ perfected was according to law because he was appointed to the office of redeemer by the oath of god as the high priest over the house of god he was consecrated and appointed to fulfill the law for those whom he represented as a high priest  the lord has sworn and will not repent thou art a priest for ever psalm cx    the messiah the son of the highest was made a priest by an oath  which is generally accounted the most solemn and surest ratification of any deed law or office the apostle to the hebrews says that the word of the oath makes the son a priest heb vii    i e makes him one in the divine appointment of jehovah which is the same with any law that ever was revealed  our savior in his death and offering of himself an atonement for our sins had a special view to the law and appointment of god i have power to lay down my life and power to take it up again this commandment have i received of my father john x    the high priest who was a type of jesus christ upon the day of expiation was obliged to observe strictly the law of atonement  for upon it depended both his own life and the ceremonial remission of the sins of the congregation the least deviation from the law was death to the priest and non acceptance to the people  the whole congregation therefore stood without in great fear and terror in the outer court till the expiation was finished and the priest came out from the holy of holies what supported their hope in the midst of their fears was the sound of the bells that were upon the hem of his garments which were heard in the outer court and it shall be upon aaron and his sons to minister and his sound shall be heard when he goes into the holy place before the lord and when he comes out that he die not exodus xxviii     and it is an evidence to us that our high priest has observed the law of the atonement appointed him  when now that he is gone to heaven the holy place not made with hands we hear the sound of his acceptance in the gospel which publishes repentance and remission of sins through his blood it is a sign that jesus christ our high priest is alive and his sacrifice is accepted of as an atonement for his church and people when life and immortality are published through his death in the gospel to the chief of sinners i am alive says he for evermore and have the keys of hell and death rev i     sect  d this redemption was vicarious or one redeeming others by being substitute in their place one paying a price of redemption as a representative of others who were guilty jests christ is in this respect the surety of the better covenant when he assumed the office of redeemer he obliged himself to do and perform what his people ought to have done and to suffer what they ought to have suffered  all the sin offerings under the law were types and figures of him and had their full accomplishment in that offering which he made of himself in the fullness of time it was impossible that the whole human race or any individual amongst them could make a sufficient atonement for their guilt  mans redemption would have ceased for ever for all that any mortal could have done to obtain it but the lord laid on him the iniquities of us all and in his mercy provided for himself a true sinoffering  there was a transmutation of guilt from the principle to the surety  which in scripture is called bearing our sins our redeemer is said to bear our sins on his own body on the tree   pet ii    the words  might read thus who himself listed up our sins in his own body upon the tree viz the cross  which he could not have done unless they had been imputed to him or transferred upon him the apostle seems to refer to isa liii   where the prophet says he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed the original words are very strong and much more expressive than our translation vebu mecholal mipshanem meducah meavonotenu musar shelemenu gnalav ubackaburato nirpah they may be thus rendered he was pierced through for our iniquities he was bruised to dust for our sins the transferring of our punishment was upon him and by his stripes we are made whole these words express the sufferings of christ in the strongest manner and point out the reason and the effects of them clearly and emphatically  the reasons of our acceptance with god and the cause of our sanctification are plainly pointed out in them if we compare the words in this passage with the  0th verse of this chap and with these words god spke from the excellent glory this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased it will be found that god is only perfectly pleased with his own son and with finners for what he has done and suffered  as our guilt is pardoned only on account of what christ has suffered so the wounds and moral bruises of our souls by sin are healed by his stripes     that this was the case we have no reason to doubt if we believe divine revelation for the scripture is both full and plain on this subject isa liii   all we like lost sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the lord has laid on him the iniquities of us all   pet ii    who himself bare our sins on his own body on the tree   cor v    for he has made him sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him   pet iii    for christ also has once suffered for sins the just for the unjust that he might bring us to god being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the spirit if words have any meaning at all those texts must point out one suffering for another  and since god has so assured us in his word of this truth it would be presumption in us to say it was inconsistent with his character to demand satisfaction when he has told us the contrary by his own express testimony  dr sikes and some others would willingly explain away the meaning of these passages without giving them a better yea without giving them any meaning at all and say they cannot mean a vicarious redemption for this would be contrary to the character of god  but how came those critics to be better informed what was suitable to the divine character than the deity himself it is evident from both the old and new testaments that the almighty did not want those passages to have any other meaning than a common reader may find at first instance because he has often repeated them after the same manner and does not seem to have thought that understanding them so would injure his character in scripture where the almighty speaks in a mystical and figurative manner it is plain he does not want to have his words understood literally and always explains his meaning by other plain passages of scripture  but with regard to those already cited we do not find any other passages when taken in their connection and scope that lead us to any other meaning  one would be ready to apprehend that such literary censors are more zealous for their own pride than for the character of the deity and rather suppose what they themselves would do if they were in his place than what they are sure is his mind and will what their wisdom thinks best they conclude is fittest for the character of their maker  and have the assurance to say what he ought to do even when he has said the quite contrary  nor will they allow the deity to be the properest judge of his own character they have a standard quite above both god and the scriptures namely their own natural notions  what is not suitable to these they will not allow to be consistent with either the divine character or common sense  nothing is more contrary and inconsistent with their notions than vicarious redemption when it implies punishment it is indeed surprising that these wise men who know the character of the deity so well by their natural notions should give such visible demonstrations of their ignorance  when in every branch of their conduct in very momentous matters they are not very studious to imitate that character they pretend to know more than other people they tell us that the almighty is all goodness which no sober man will deny more than they but will perhaps say that he is as much all justice equity and holiness  but not to say any thing of the absurdity of pretending to say what the deity is  which no man can tell further than he himself has revealed it might be expected if they believed the almighty was so very good that they would imitate his character if indulging the passions and gratifying the appetites be imitations of god in goodness those devotees of goodness have made considerable seize  they can receive bondsmen for debts throw debtors into jail domineer over their inferiors and dependents like other men  and if their lives and conduct be a real imitation of their deity they are in some jeopardy notwithstanding of that goodness they have learned by their natural notions they in real life express as much vengeance toward those who injure or offend them as the rest of their fellow men that differ from them in sentiment and when fairly provoked forget what they profess to believe concerning their maker  and though they conceive the deity to be so good as to demand no satisfaction yet they want to be satisfied themselves such conduct is a burlesque of their pretended belief and makes them truly ridiculous if the deity they profess to worship be as unmerciful as they themselves are notwithstanding of that goodness they boast of they are in danger of being miserable enough but after all it seems not more inconsistent with god to accept of a vicarious atonement or redemption and christ to give it than it was inconsistent with him to make the world for if we consider the character of god revealed to us in his word and not what our natural notions suggest we will find it drawn in such a manner that this world as it now appears is not answerable to that character i e it is nothing in comparison with what god could have made it  and we may as well complain of god for not making us angels as complain of his conduct for requiring an atonement for our sins  for god was good before time as well as after it commenced and according to some peoples natural notions of goodness should have made man so that he could not have fallen  or in other words made him a deity for this is the language of pride ye shall be as gods  there was certainly necessity for a vicarious redemption otherwise god would not have required any  but in his dispensations toward the jews vicarious atonements were among the first institutions that were made a part of their religious economy the apostle to the hebrews informs us that all these vicarious atonements were shadows of christ to come yea that the whole tabernacle and temple service were figures of jesus christ the true messiah  and we are expressly told that he came in the end of time to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself heb x      that he was manifested to take away sin and in him was no sin   john iii    it seems to have been the common opinion of all nations where any notions of god ever entered that there was necessity for vicarious atonements  for all nations whoe story we have mentioned in history had some rituals of this sort in their religious worship  but common sense tells us that it is not inconsistent with the almightys goodness to demand a vicarious redemption  for what is the meaning of requiring satisfaction for the breach of human laws if this notion of satisfaction be not taken from some notices we have received from the deity if it be good for civil government which all men for the most part agree is from god thus to demand satisfaction in the lower system of his administration it cannot well be supposed inconsistent with his goodness to demand satisfaction in the more exalted part of his government  that this redemption was vicarious will appear from the very goodness of god made use of against its necessity  for how was it consistent with the divine goodness to make christ suffer such grievous sorrows if he was in no sense guilty  for it is agreed on all hands that he had no sin of his own it is abundantly evident from scripture that there never were any sorrow like unto his is it nothing unto you all ye that pass by behold and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow which is done unto me wherewith the lord has afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger lam i    could there be any thing more tyrannical and arbitrary than to make an innocent person undergo such grievous sufferings  when jehovah from the excellent glory had declared he was well pleased with him in punishing an offender there is nothing unjust or contrary to the nature of moral goodness  but to punish an innocent person so well approved of by god is not so easily accounted for revelation only can satisfy us as to this he bare our sins in his own body on the tree   pet ii    the lord laid on him the iniquities of us all isa liii    if jesus christ came to set us an example of patience and resignation to the will of god under all our afflictions and sufferings  and this was all that was intended by his death  why did god himself afflict him so grievously in his soul with such horrible terrors which made the very blood sweat from his body when there were no visible trouble upon him this does not well agree with the character of the almighty  who does not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men without a a cause there was certainly something more than example here otherwise it was all in vain for never man was or will be able to copy after it  what had almost broke the heart of our redeemer would altogether break the hearts of the sons of men jesus christ himself seems to have had quite different views in his sufferings  for he says to those who came to apprehend him if ye seek me let these go their way john xviii   he seems plainly to have considered himself as a vicarious redeemer one substitute in the room and place of others but if christ came only to instruct us as a prophet and to set us an example by his sufferings he has set before us the most fearful example that ever was set before mortals  an example of bearing the punishment of sin and the wrath of god due on account of our iniquity ah fearful example tremendous pattern who among the sons of men can follow the footsteps of such a savior what so severely scorched the green tree would effectually burn up all the dry ones  and unless men were qualified in the same degree that christ was his very example would be a sufficient hell to them ye followers of christ upon this plan could you follow him to the garden of gethsemene with all that anguish of soul which he suffered there could you undergo such a bloody sweat as jesus did and live  none but a divine person could endure such grief and sorrow as were inflicted upon jesus christ  and unless christ could endow his people with the same degree of perfection power and holiness that was in him it would be impossible to copy his pattern  that our redeemer did bear the wrath of god the scriptures affirm expressly thy wrath lies hard upon me and thou have afflicted me with all thy waves  thy fierce wrath goes over me thy terrors have cut me off psalm lxxxviii      it is because the chastisement of our peace was upon him that he suffered such grievous sorrows and because he came in the room of the guilty that he suffered unto death  and not mrely to set us an example he gave himself a ransom to redeem us from all iniquity and to purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works  from all which it appears evident that our lords redemption was vicarious  sect  d this redemption was a procuring of that inheritance which man lost mans portion and inheritance whereby he could have lived happy and enjoyed life was the favor and fellowship of his maker  this enjoyment he forfeited by breaking the divine law and transgressing the holy commandment  man was driven from his inheritance and became a vagabond upon the earth for renouncing his allegiance to the almighty he had nothing after he had sinned that he could call his own but what he would have been better without namely the divine displeasure threatened in the sanction of the law of works  and besides he was miserable by what he had lost all enjoyments whatsoever unless connected with the divine favor tend only to make the curse sit faster upon guilty minds it is only in the favor of god there is life all other vital acts are only the shadow of life  for without the favor of god a man is dead while he lives when god created man at first he made him lord of this lower world and heir of everlasting felicity in the next upon condition that he should obey that law which he gave him as the test of his dependence upon him and his acknowledgment of his makers sovereignty his faithful service for a season would have entitled him to a crown of immortal life  but he sold himself to satan for the pleasures of sense and lost his liberty by gratifying his taste by seeking to become wise he became a fool and marred his happiness by stretching its limits beyond the divine prohibition by giving himself up to be the servant of sin and satan god in righteous judgment condemned him to be their slaves and instead of that blessed inheritance of immortal life he had reason as the son of god to expect if he had continued in his service he was made a slave to the devil and a subject of death through pride and seduction he lost an inheritance which would have for ever enriched both him and his posterity  now man is miserable for wanting what only can make him happy and is not able to pay a ransom for what he has lost but god who is abundant in love and infinite in mercy sent his son in human nature  who has given his lifes blood to redeem the lost inheritance the strong one jehovahs partner the man his fellow or of his right hand was sent to redeem that forefeited inheritance that his little ones might not perish but have everlasting life this holy life and obedience which we call active to distinguish it from his passion and sufferings is the meritorious reason of mens being received again into the favor of god it was through disobedience that man lost the favor of his maker and it is by obedience that any of fallen adams posterity are restored to it again  for as by one mans disobedience many were made sinners so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous romans v    but before our redeemer could procure the favor of god as an inheritance to eternal life it was necessary that he should be related to those for whom he was to obtain it that question whether jesus christ procured the love of god is a very needless one had those who moved it attended to the plain meaning of words they would never have proposed it  love and benevolence in as far as we know any thing of them are the same namely sovereign good pleasure favor and acceptance also signify the same thing and may be expressed by the word friendship though jesus christ did not procure the divine good will yet he obtained our acceptance with god the apostle tells us ephesians ii    that through him we have access by one spirit to the father  which the apostle to the hebrews says is obtained by the blood of christ heb x    having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the bood of jesus  the almighty according to his moral character expressed in the first public revelation of his will is a declared enemy to sin and as the supreme and righteous governor of the world an enemy to sinners on account of it but this implies no more than the opposition of his infinitely perfect moral character to the guilty and vile character of sinners  there is no such passion in the divine nature as ared  it is only the opposition of his nature to what is opposite to and unlike itself  god bestows his love or good will sovereignly without any reason out of himself he loves because he pleases  but his favor and friendship are bestowed upon the guilty for moral considerations he gve his son freely and sovereignly without any reason but his good pleasure  but he bestows his favors upon sinners for his sons ske isa liii    by his knowledge shall my righteous servant make many righteous for he shall carry their iniquities imposed upon him where the connection between our saviors bearing the sins of his people and their justification is manifest the divine good will and pleasure is the source of all grace and favor to guilty men  but the blood of jesus christ is the channel through which these favors are conveyed to them the first channel through which the favor of god was conveyed to the world was stopped by the offense of our first parents favor friendship and acceptance with god could no more run in that channel  but jesus christ by giving his lifes blood for that offense has opened a new and living way whereby grace and favor might reign through his righteousness to the most worthless and chief of sinners consistently with jehovahs moral character expressed in the first revelation of his will  the divine love or good will considers all the chosen of god as one in christ but his grace and favor respect them as many members of the one body the almighty had but one good will to all his people as the body of christ which he expressed in choosing them in him before the world began but his favors are many according to the number and wants of his members it is agreed almost on all hands that man lost the favor of god by transgressing his law  it is also manifest from scripture that mans life lies in the favor of his maker if this is really the case that the first man lost life and happiness by forfeiting the favor of the almighty it is as manifest that the second man obtained it to his people by procuring his favor eternal life which lies in the favor of god is now bestowed through the channel of a ransom or purchase which our redeemer paid to remove the forfeiture of happiness by shedding his blood  the apostle tells us that the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord for though our redeemer paid the ransom price of his blood for the christians inheritance it is still the gift of god to us as much as it had never been procured by price  because we can give nothing for its ransom  besides it was jehovah himself that provided and was pleased to admit a goal according to the first revelation of the will of god redemption was necessary to clear the character of the lawgiver from all imputation of unrighteousness  and so he showed in all his afterdealings with men a respect to that first revelation  but to fulfill the pupose of his good will he provided a goal or kinsman savior who should fulfill the whole of the first law as to both the letter and spirit of it and thereby open free access to sinners to the favor and friendship of god with respect to that first law the death of christ was in reality a ransom price for he came into the world to fulfill it eternal life is the purchase of christ as far as it respects that lw which threatened everlasting punishment but it is the gift of god as far as god provided a redeemer and was pleased to admit of a furety none of these things according to the spirit of the first revelation he was obliged to do eternal life the apostle tells us was given to us in christ jesus before the world began  but it was given to him to work out by his obedience unto death  so by his death he wrought out eternal life believers therefore obtain eternal life by a work which christ finished upon the cross fallen men are like a son banished from his fathers house for breaking the laws of the family and rebelling against his father the father according to the laws of his house cannot receive his son into favor without some atonement and satisfaction for the rebellion against his supremacy for if he should it would show that his laws were of no weight  yet notwithstanding his goodwill to his prodigal son inclines him to find out a friend or prevail with the elder brother to pay the prodigal sons ransom  that he may again receive him into favor and the rest of his dependents may see how righteous and just he is  and his son may feel how gracious and good both his father and elder brother are  the love and benevolence of the father is the reason of him prevailing with the elder brother to pay the ransom  but it is the ransom which the elder brother pays that is the reason of the prodigals being again received into favor the younger brother is justified and acquitted from the guilt on account of the elder brother becoming his goal or redemer  dr gill and some others by not attending to the plain distinction between benevolence and favor have endeavored to support an eternal justification of the elect  and because god out of his good pleasure decreed to justify them have concluded that they are really justified but they ought to have considered that the divine love is not the reason in law whereby sinners are acquitted from the guilt of an evil action but some deed conformable to the moral justice and equity expressed in the first publication of the will of god  for upon the same principles that eternal justification is built upon  eternal guilt and condemnation may also be supported  also the eternal existence of men and the revelation of a law to them  for where there is no law there is no transgression the sons of god were like absalom in the land of the philistines out of savor but the kings good will or love was not abated toward them it was gods benevolence that made him send his son to pay the price of mans redemption that he might consistently with that public character which he first assumed as a lawgiver to men receive sinners into favor christs doing and suffering were all that law and justice could demand and were fully as powerful and prevalent to restore the guilty to favor as mans disobedience was to cast him out of it     it was by his holy active obedience that he procured that favor which man lost by his sin and transgression the whole human race had forfeited their right to communion and fellowship with god  so there was a forfeiture upon their inheritance which was necessary to be removed before they could again enter upon the possession this forfeiture our lord jesus christ paid by his obedience unto death and has restored his people into the forfeited favor of god and makes them partakers of those divine pleasures that are in his presence it was continuing in the service of god that would have secured the inheritance of eternal life to man  and it was by our first parents their coming short before the time of probation was ended that they and their seed lost that inheritance  for cursed is he that continues not in all things written in the book of the law to do them had there been no sanction annexed to the law then any person who had been able to have taken up the ak where adam left it might have set all to right again  but justice had a claim for satisfaction by virtue of the curse annexed to the law in the day thou eatest thereof thou shall die our redeemer was therefore obliged to fulfill that law which man left unfinished that he might procure access into the divine favor  and also to bear the curse  that the justice and truth of jehovahs character might appear in reinstating man into the favor of his maker but as man was also himself a prisoner as well as an insolvent debtor to justice there was still something more necessary  sect  th this redemption which christ accomplished for his people was a redemption of persons there was a necessity of loosing the bonds of the prisoners and of opening the prison doors as well as procuring a good inheritance in the enjoyment of the favor of god the divine favor is what the servants of sin cannot enjoy  because they are satans captives and led by him at his pleasure this redemption of the persons of believers was twofold according to the nature of their bondage they were bound over by a just sentence of the law to death and were arrested at the instance of justice and could not get clear til the uttermost farthing was paid in this sense they are held like persons under attainder  as guilty of treason against the sovereign of heaven and earth nothing but the price of blood could release them so the prophet informs us that by the blood of the covenant christ brings forth the prisoners out of the pit wherein there is no water he paid the price of their redemption by his precious blood and died to rescue them out of the prison of spiritual and eternal death he paid their ransom by his blood and has delivered them from going down to the pit  by virtue of this ransom their persons became his property and he sts them free agreeable to both law and justice  hence they are justified and acquitted from the curse by which they were held  which like a heavy chain held them fast in the prison of spiritual death  so that they were unable to move in any holy acts of duty toward god the curse of the law hinders men in the practice of moral duty because it leaves them no hopes  without which no man living will pursue virtuous actions it is the hope of the glory of god that makes men rejoice in tribulations suffer patiently unto the end  but no man can have any reason of hope who is under the curse     but not only are men as they are the descendants of the first adam prisoners of justice but they are also captives to sin and satan made to grind in his prisonhouse by serving diverse lusts and pleasures christ redeems them from satans dominion by his power as he delivers them from justice by the price of his blood  so hereby the captives are delivered and the prey of the terrible taken away  this deliverance the redeemer performs by the gospel which is the rod of his strength sent out of mount zion whereby he pulls down satans kingdom and relieves his people satan that cruel enemy of mans happiness is not willing to part with his captives and notwithstanding of their ransom being paid endeavors to hold them fast in the fetters of sin and prejudice  but their redeemer is mighty the lord of hosts is his name jer l     he sends his powerful word come forth and all the powers of hell cannot hold them longer  the gospel as the rod of chrits power bruiseth satan under his peoples feet and persuades and enables them to flee from the wrath to come this part of the redemption which our redeemer performs consists in changing the purposes of his peoples minds by the superior evidence of the gospel of peace it is by the apostle romans viii   called a fulfilling of the law in them  this is a redemption of the persons of believers with a strong hand and belongs to jesus christ under the character of a conqueror  traveling in the greatness of his strength the gospel which is a stumbling block to the jews and foolishness to the greeks is the power of god and the wisdom of god in calling his people out of darkness into his marvelous light the word of truth however simple in itself is by the evidence which the spirit that speaks in it gives it mighty through god to pull down strong holds and every imagination that exalts itself against the kingdom of christ its evidence arises from its simplicity and is not like the enticing words of mans wisdom which please those who belong to the kingdoms of this world it flatters no man while in a state of sin or while living in the practice of it but plainly tells him his doom while he remains in that condition  but at the same time proclaims liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison doors to those who are bound it exhibits very great and precious promises to all who believe in jesus christ and affords the surest reason of hope to the miserable and wretched it speaks nothing but woes to hypocrites and such as go about to establish a righteousness of their own for it calls not the righteous but sinners to repentance this gospel looks with no favorable aspect upon such as are seeking requisities to prepare them to come to christ but looks benignly upon the poor the miserable the blind and the naked it says not one word of peace or pardon to the wise man or the disputer of this world while it scatters its influence among those who are accounted worst by the sons of pride  this word of jesus christ which saves men from the power of sin and the captivity of the devil has indeed an influence upon its enemies  but it is to torment them as it does their father the devil  who believes and trembles the same word that begets faith in the souls of those who are called and gives hope and great joy to the wretched and miserable among men begets pain and remorse in the consciences of the proud and torment in the minds of devils though this faith which the gospel produces and brings forth has received the opprobrious name of the faith of devils yet it is the word of christs patience and power which begets in the souls of his chosen people a belief of the same truth which makes those evil spirits tremble the faith of saints and devils is no way different the difference lies in their hopes the one has no hope from the truth they believe but pain and sorrow whereas the others from the same truth have a noble reason of hope which revives and supports their minds  whenever any man believes the truth of the gospel as firmly as the devils do it presents to him a ground of hope that overbalanceth all his reasons of despair among those inhabitant of the regions of darkness notwithstanding of their believing the truth their reasons of despair outweigh their reasons of hope  because the gospel is not sent to them  but to men under every guilty circumstance it says to you is the word of this salvation sent  jesus christ delivers his people when they are in captivity by opening their eyes and pointing out to them the way of escape he opens mens blinded understandings by the light of his gospel and brings them out of darkness into his marvelous light  the scripture calls this a turning them from darkness unto light and from the power of satan unto god when satan got man into his prison he did with him as the philistines did with sampson  put out his eyes and it is through ignorance that he holds them in his power  for whenever the light is made to shine into their hearts they break his prison and escape hence the gospel saves men by making them know the things which belong to their peace in this respect knowledge is the principle of faith and faith the exercise of knowledge  for only those who know jehovahs name will put their trust in him the gospel becomes a principle of understanding  which by its own evidence begets assent to its truth in the soul which in scripture has received the name of faith this faith is termed the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen  or as that passage may more properly be read  the firm foundation of things hoped for and the argument or proof of things not seen the testimony of god made known to men is the firm foundation of faith and faith is the argument or proof to us of the truth and reality of what is testified the gospel gives being to faith and faith realizes the object to us or gives it a real existence in our souls it is by the power of christs word that the souls of his people escape out of the snares of the devil and forsake his service  sect  th this redemption is meritorious it is not merely an allusive and figurative one  when christ is called a redeemer it is not because moses joshua david and others were so called but because he is really a savior and redeemer  who paid the price of our redemption the price he paid was truly worthy of all that ever his people can receive on account thereof it is a sufficient reason and argument in law and equity why god should justify the ungodly the merit of this redemption arose from the nature and dignity of the person who paid the price of it our savior was truly god as well as very man the modern enemies of our savior begin to sneer at such phrase as the above and like nicodemus are ready to say how can thesethings be and what they are not able to refute with any show of reason or argument they endeavor to turn into ridicule yet one may easily perceive that they smile but aukwardly for the force of scripture evidence being so very clear against them makes them on occasions betray some degree of concern mixed with their irrefragable smile  it would require a good degree of critical knowledge to enable any man to explain away the meaning of so many plain passages of holy scripture which at first view seem to point out this truth that the messiah is god as well as man  for at the same time that he assumes the title of our goal and kinsman savior he takes to himself the highest name that ever is assumed by the creator of the universe isa xliv   ka omar jehovah melech israel vegoalo jehovah sabbath any rishon va any acharon u mibbal gnadi in elokim thus says jehovah king of israel and his kinsman redeemer the lord jehovah of hosts i am the first and the last and besides me there

the holy one of israel will help you compared with acts iii    and ye denied the holy one and the just  i am inclined to think that wherever jehovah is in scripture represented as a goal or kinsman redoemer that the messiah is meant jacob gives this name of goal to an angel which could be no other but the angel of the covenant gen xlviii    hamalach hagoaloti michal roagn the angel my kinsman redeemer from all evil  which our version reads has redeemed me from all evil job xix    gives the like character to the messiah jadgnati goali hai veacharon algnaphar jakum i know that my kinsman redeemer is living and that at last he shall stand upon the dust of the earth  it would be but kind in those who will not allow the messiah to be the true god to give us some good reason why he assumes such names and affirms that he has performed such works as none but the supreme can justly claim or is able to perform the old jewish principles rule still in the hearts of the children of disobedience for they cannot understand the consistence of jesuss claim to such a high character when he was pleased to appear in such a low one  that is to say unless they are able to understand as much as their maker they will not believe him   and the relation his work had to his infinitely holy person gave it a value worthy of all that sinners can ever stand in need of it is for this reason that our redeemer is so highly exalted as mediator  because being the true god he humbled himself unto the death the actions of our saviors human nature received an infinite value and dignity from their being the works of him who is the true god and eternal life no finite creature can ever receive more or greater favors than our redeemer merited by his death  for this reason there is an eternity ordained for the enjoyment of them  that what can never be exhausted may be ever enjoyed the song of the redeemed in heaven is filled with the worth and excellence of jesus christ and his redemption rev v    worthy is the lamb that was slain to receive glory honor dominion and power  for thou wast slain and have redeemed us to god by thy blood  chap ii the qualifications necessary to fit the redeemer to perform mans redemption sect  st it was necessary that our redeemer should be a party in that covenant according to which sinners were to be saved no person who was not able and worthy to treat with jehovah and to engage his heart to approach unto him could be qualified to redeem lost sinners  and suppose he had been qualified yet if he had not actually done it he would have wanted a true legal qualification for his work such as do act for others in matters where law is concerned do not merely act according to their ability and personal endowments but according to the law that relates to the transaction personal endowments were essentially necessary but mutual and actual engagements were morally necessary also as our lord jesus christ intended to redeem his people it was necessary for him as their covenanthead to be mutually engaged for them in a contract mutually with his father and their god  that so the will of the parties engaged might be one joint counsel  so the prophet tells us that the council of peace was between them both zech vi    had not christ been a party in the covenant of peace all that he did could not have been answerable to the breach of the covenant of works the first covenant was broken by adam as a party in it and his posterity were ruined in consequence thereof  so the children of our redeemer are saved from the ruin of the first covenant by his being a party in the second i have says god made a covenant with my chosen psalm lxxxix   by our redeemer being a party in the covenant of grace he was qualified to plead the benefits of his redemption for his people when the conditions in that covenant were fulfilled and could plead the original contract as a party that was worthy to covenant with god  thus by having really covenanted for guilty sinners he was qualified to ascertain the number of his seed  through his knowledge of the contract in which he was a party  and could plead the word of the father in that covenant made with him when he shall make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed and prolong his days and the pleasure of the lord shall prosper in his hand with regard to all this as a party in the covenant of peace he could say lord do as thou have said  our redeemers being a party in the new covenant qualified him to know both the number of his spiritual seed and the great and good things that are laid up for them in the covenant of grace and promise in consequence thereof he could very properly pardon sin and forgive the iniquity of the guilty because he knew what he had contracted for in their behalf and what he was able to do in fulfilling his contract had not our savior been a party in that covenant his suretyship could have no way been answerable to the necessity of guilty man  who needed one substituted in his place as a covenantparty it was entirely owing to the first adams being a party in the first covenant that his posterity were found guilty for the breach of it and it is because jesus christ is a party in the second covenant that his righteousness in fulfilling it as their surety is the reason of their acceptance with god our saviors righteousness could not have been a covenant one unless he had been a party in it so it was an essential qualification to jesus christ our savior to be a party in the covenant of grace  sect  d it was an essential qualification in our redeemer to be related to both god and man mans redemption could not have been effected by any not truly god and really man  for deity could not suffer and a mere man could not have given such a ransom as was answerable to the spirit of the law and the demands of justice  and moreover as man had offended god and incurred his just displeasure by disobedience it was necessary the reconciler should be able to please god and restore man into his favor when we speak of christ reconciling us to god i know that some allege that no more is meant than taking away of the enmity of our minds against him  but the scripture seems to signify something more that christ had to peform a work whereby it might appear consistent with gods holy character to express himself well pleased toward them who have offended him  and though nothing which christ did made any change in the divine mind yet it makes a great alteration in his conduct toward man     the most perfect man that ever existed even the human nature of jesus christ unless it had been united to the deity could not have effected mans redemption  for the most perfect finite service could merit no more than a finite reward and the death of a finite person could not in the nature of the thing be a price of redemption from an infinite curse  justly pronounced against sin wherever it should be found or in whatever form  there were two things which made it impossible for a mere man to redeem a guilty world  the nature of justice required that there should be adequate satisfaction made for the offense committed that the character of the most high might be justified in justifying the ungodly though we may conceive many things which we think the almighty might do or have done so far as they respect our interest yet we are not certain that he could have done otherwise  on the contrary we are rather sure that he could not morally have acted otherwise or than he would have done it it is not our part to say what our maker could have done as to his power or any other attribute of his nature  but whether according to the system of his government revealed to us could he have acted otherwise agreeable thereto was the first system which man was placed in perfect and did god speak in earnest when he said in the day thou eatest thou shall die will it not appear more conformable to that system that a perfect satisfaction be given to his justice expressed in his law by one who was able to give it than that the divine character be any way obscured in its truth and veracity  it was therefore necessary that our redeemer should be god and man or emmanuel  that he might be able to support the moral character of the deity by giving a righteous and perfect obedience conformable to that law  which was an exact image of his character  and might be able to give satisfaction to what truly may be called justice to make a complete redemption conformable to the truth and holiness of god thus qualified he could give all the satisfaction the purest justice could exact in the same nature that had given the offense  nor does this represent religion in any unfavourable point of light or set forth the almighty as cruel and capricious  when out of his mercy he found a chosen one  who at the same time that he repaired that awful breach could suffer no loss to himself  had what jesus christ did for sinners ruined himself or had death been able to detain him prisoner  or had the making of men eternally happy made him miserable then might the enemies of the atonement called the scheme of mans redemption a cruel scheme  and the deity severe  but when the sufferings of jesus christ were salutary to men and in the event exalted the character of the most high in the esteem of men and angels and brought honor to our redeemer also there does not appear any thing in the whole scheme but what is consistent with perfect goodness yea it exalts the goodness and extolls the love of god  sect  d it was necessary that the human nature which christ assumed should be perfectly innocent had our saviors human nature had either original or actual sin it could not have been a proper sinoffering  for in this case he would have needed an atonement for his own iniquity  but that nature which he assumed though it was equally related to the believing seed of abraham yet it was not partaker of any of that pollution which is common to the nature of man this human nature of jesus christ was sanctified by the holy ghost and brought forth in an extraordinary manner of a virgin  and though of the same kind with that of others was yet free of that natural pollution which stains the best services of such where it prevails  but jesus christ was holy harmless undefiled and separated from sinners without sin nor was guile found in him his sacrifice was sinless and perfect as well as divinely pure and holy  on account of its relation to him who is the true god though as a surety he was accounted guilty as bearing our sins  yet was he ever separated from sinners in respect of every moral impurity  the pure law could not find the smallest defect in his sinoffering nor could the severest justice spy the least imperfection in that nature which was given him for a sacrifice  there was a passive innocence in the human nature of jesus christ  whereby he was morally inoffensive he had no disposition to give or to take offense as is common among men  he had no selfish pride in him nor any inordinate passions arising from the connection between his soul and body passions and appetites not subordinate to pure reason and the will of god are peculiar to corrupt and imperfect creatures in christ there were none such he had no ambition to make him envy or grieve at the good of others but he constantly rejoiced to see men happy and to make them so all the affections of his human soul were passively pure and holy and could not be moved to think or do evil  but this was not all the purity of his nature did not merely dispose him to do no evil or injury to any but it inclined him to seek mens happiness on all occasions he went continually about doing good from a holy propensity of mind toward what was worthy and virtuous our redeemer had no occasion to be excited to do good by any motives from without  for he had the law of god in his heart he had a perfect knowledge of moral rectitude and a perfect love of all truth thou love righteousness and hate iniquity therefore god thy god has anointed thee with the oil of joy above thy fellows psalm xiv   it was as natural for him to love truth as it is for other men under the influence of corruption to err and go astray from it it was the love of righteousness which constantly inclined him to do his fathers will  and made him pursue the great end for which be came into the world  which was to seek and save that which was lost  sect  th it was necessary that he should be appointed and have instructions for his office of redeemer without a special appointment and proper instructions the execution of any office would be intrusion natural endowments may fit a person for the execution of an office but does not morally qualify him in law without appointment thereto our redeemer did not run unsent  but was called of god as was aaron hence we have frequently in the gospel his declaration that the father sent him he demonstrated his divine mission by works that were truly miraculous and wonderful  to these he appeals as a proof of his being sent of god  if i do not the works of my father believe me not john x    the father which sent me he does the work john xiv  0 christ was called to his office by god in the most solemn manner  the lord has sworn and will not repent thou art a priest for ever psalm cx   when christ speaks of himself as the good shepherd he opposes himself to such as came unsent  whom he calls thieves and robbers it was because our savior was appointed to this office of surety that he had security for assistance to support him in his work his mission and appointment were constantly before his eyes and upon this he founds his arguments in his prayer to the father i have finished the work thou gave me to do  therefore glorify thou me with that glory which i had with thee before the world was john xvii   dr watts mr allen and some others from this text would attempt to prove the preexistence of christs human soul but it does not seem that our saviors prayer refers to any glory he had in possession before the world but to what he had in promise as one of the elohim or swearers or covenanters he had a promise made to him in that covenant of peace of aid and support in his suffering and of a glorious resurrection from the dead he had this glory promised him before the world began this was a glory he had with the father to receive a right by promise of a glorious resurrection  so his prayer here must refer to a promise he had in his eye  for the promise is the rule of the prayer of faith  the royal prophet personating jesus christ foretold what our savior here prays for psalm xvi  0 thou will not leave my life or soul in the grave nor suffer thy holy one to see corruption  which may be explained by luke i    the holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god  for the word psalm xvi  0 is chesed not kodesh  the word which in the old testament is used to signity the holy one of israel  our redeemer had the glory to be a partner in the great transaction where mans redemption was settled  and received a promise that his human nature should not sink under suffering nor be left to see corruption  and he here says that the muual glory of him and his father was concerned in that work he was now about to engage in he puts up a prayer of faith for the accomplishment of that promise which concerned both his fathers glory and his own glorify me with thine own self intimating that the glory of both was concerned i e fulfill thy promise to me and make thy faithfulness appear conspicuous when the council of peace was between us both it was my glory to receive a promise of help and assistance and thine to make it  therefore glorify me with thine own self here our savior asks what he bare witness to when he bare record as one of the elohim concerning the transaction of grace there seems no occasion of assuming any new hypothesis upon this subject when the truth may be accounted for without any     he could plead the law of his appointment and the oath that was made to him as the high priest over the house of god without an appointment to his office and work there would have been no certainty that ever his work should have been accepted  but as he was solemnly appointed by the oath of jehovah the law of the appointment secured to him acceptance whenever he should finish his work  chap iii the effects of christ s redemption when it is manifested to the souls of believers sect  st it produces an esteem of christ and all things that are his when jesus christ makes himself known to his people as a redeemer and displays the glory of his redemption unto them the amiableness of his person and the greatness of the salvation he has procured by his blood quite subdues their hearts and gains their esteem such as saw no comeliness in him why he should be desired  while under the power of ignorance and the influence of error become by the manifestation of his excellencies altogether charmed with his beauty it is impossible but those who know this blessed object should esteem him  because his excellencies are morally engaging and have the power to transform the mind into a sameness of moral likeness with himself the apostle who understood this subject better than most of men affirms it as a matter of certainty  that by beholding the glory of god through jesus we are transformed into the same image from glory to glory there are none who know the redeemer but do love him and such as do not render him their supreme regard do testify that they know him not  there is something in the world which men call knowledge which is only a specious resemblance of it yet is oftentimes mistaken for true understanding through means of the gospel revelation men may come to some specious understanding of the character of jesus christ so as to enable them to speak as if they knew him  but then their knowledge is no more than the wisdom of words this kind of knowledge may be called a passing view of christs character which may lead men to some speculation but can never be reduced to practice this sort of spurious knowledge is like that which we learn of the characters of men at court in the common news  which may enable us to form conjectures concerning the leading draughts of certain reputations but being remote from the persons and the theater on which they act we are uncertain of the justness of the various descriptions of character which may be given them  but true knowledge of jesus christ by the gospel is like that which we attain by friendly information  where the informer acts the part of a friendly instructor  and knowing himself the things which he teaches and describes perfectly represents them with such evidence that our knowledge becomes certain and real  the truths of the gospel to all who have not felt their power are only like the common news to a common reader  which may learn him to speak but does not afford any certain knowledge nor make him any wiser  yet a stranger would perhaps not know the difference between such persons and men of more wisdom if he only heard them speak it is action which testifies the truth of true knowledge  he who pretends to know but is not truly instructed exposes his own ignorance when brought to trial christians who are really instructed in the knowledge of the gospel and understand the character of jesus christ are enabled according to their measure to act his character as a pattern of holiness  their lives and that of christ are as like one another in the leading parts of character as the image of babes and perfect men are like one another it is a saying common enough with regard to some persons that it is not for want of knowledge in religion that they do not live as becomes the gospel this is not true in fact if we consider the word knowledge in a strict sense  whenever any person knows jesus christ rightly it transforms him into his likeness and disposes him to walk as he also walked the knowledge of things in which men are not much interested may be attained without producing any visible alteration in their conduct  nor would men judge fairly of their understanding if they should conclude them ignorant of what they did not practice  when neither pleasure nor happiness are connected with such practice  the knowledge of things indifferent may be obtained without any visible evidence in action  for being indifferent the practice upon knowing them is not absolutely necessary but to walk as christ also walked and to imitate him as the blessed pattern of holiness and perfection is absolutely necessary to happiness in this life or that which is to come  when the excellencies of christ are made known to the souls of men the connection between an imitation of them and everlasting happiness is also made known  and the very power of that knowledge inclines the minds of christians to observe the imitation psalm ix  0 they that know thy name will put their trust in thee he that loves not knows not god   john iv   the apostle points out the connection between true knowledge of christ and the work and labor of love   john ii   he that says i know him and keeps not his commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him ver   he that says he is in the light and hates his brother is in darkness even until now he that loves his brother abides in the light and there is no occasion of stumbling in him but he that hates his brother is in darkness and walks in darkness and knows not whither he goes because that darkness has blinded his eyes those who know god hear and obey what the apostles of christ has said  but whoever form their religious practice upon any other plan testify that they know not god  even suppose they should make a great show of godliness in will worship  let the apostle john determine this point   john iv   we are of god he that knows god hears us he that is not of god hears not us  hereby we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error beloved let us love one another for love is of god and every one that loves is born of god and knows god the reason why men do not esteem jesus christ and all things that are his is because they know him not luke gives this for the reason in the acts of the apostles why the jews condemned and crucified jesus christ because they knew him not acts xiii    for they that dwell at jerusalem because they knew him not nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day they have fulfilled them in condemning him  wherever jesus christ makes a true and real discovery of his own character and redemption to the souls of men by his gospel  so as the discovery becomes the materials of knowledge or rather knowledge itself it as necessarily begets esteem of jesus as any active principle produces its proper effects it becomes a part of a believers moral constitution and operates in the soul as a principle of action  and this knowledge expresses itself in the way of esteeming christ and all that is his such as do not esteem our redeemer it is because they do not know him  they have not the full conviction of his excellence fitness and sufficiency  i know it has been often said that men may have the knowledge and full conviction of the truth and yet not be truly reformed thereby  this i cannot so easily understand  for our savior tells us that such as know the truth are set at liberty  ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free john viii    wherever the scripture speaks of wicked men knowing god it must be understood comparatively with others who are more ignorant of the things which they are said to know a servant may know his masters will and not do it i e the things which he knows may be what his master requires but still he does not know as he ought to know  and it is called knowledge in contrast to other mens total ignorance as long as men are not reformed in their hearts and lives they cannot properly be said to be convinced of truth  nor accounted such who know jesus christ  and it is their ignorance which keeps them in bondage to satan  they have such wisdom which passes for true knowledge in the world and which may make a very specious appearance and deceive men  but it never proves its efficacy by that labor of love and esteem of jesus christ which true knowledge produces in them who have it what solomon says of wisdom may be strictly said of knowledge  it gives life to them who have it what has made men fall into a mistake in thinking that themselves or others have been possessed of true knowledge when they have been really ignorant of truth is their not considering the difference between transient views and solid understanding there are many transient and passing views which persons may have of objects which cannot justly be called true knowledge  in objects of senfe they may be called glances  in objects of moral truth they may be called hints  in matters of fact or testimony they may be called notices men may have some glances of a figure whose properties they do not understand and suppose they had a passing view of it yet they do not understand the form nor use of it without instruction  a moral truth may be represented to our mind by some hints but is either removed before we understand it or the mind parts with it before it knows it  matters of fact may be brought to our hearing upon a credible enough testimony which may give notice of very surprising or profitable things  but the notices may either be short and imperfect or not often enough repeated to leave an impression of the truth of the facts and the authority of the author upon our minds  and in this respect is not true knowledge this is something like a tale that is told  which though it may afford for the time some entertainment is not competent to be reduced into practice  those three kinds of passing views may be illustrated by these similitudes  the first is like one who views his face in a glass but forgets what manner of man he was  the second is like one who receives the dictates of a master upon a subject the rudiments of which he has never learned  so has no knowledge of but as far as any thing he has heard said is agreeable with something he has already learned  the latter is like one who receives the news from another who passes by but is not able to form a judgment of what is reported  because he has not time to be acquainted with the author who reports the facts that knowledge which superficial enquirers have in matters of religion is like the two last forts of knowledge things marvelous may transiently be pointed out to them  and alarming facts may be told them which may surprise them  or create a sudden transport of wonder or fear according to the nature of the things intimated  but what so suddenly struck them may as quickly be removed so that it never becomes a principle of action in their hearts nor leaves any just or lasting impression upon their minds  this neither affords a sufficient information to the judgment nor produces a full conviction in the conscience of the truth of what is reported it is only a transient passing view of truth but not the knowledge thereof the knowledge of jesus christ consists in the understanding of the character of him that speaks  when he makes the report the matter of knowledge in the soul he makes it show his own veracity and a believer is instructed as well in the character of the person who reveals the truth as in the report he makes  the gospel has this excellency above all other reports  that it is calculated to make known the character and veracity of him who publishes it and shows with the surest evidence who he is that is the author of it we have no proof but what the gospel itself contains that god is the author of it  nor have we any certain evidence to satisfy us that we are not imposed upon but what is expressed in the very testimony we believe whoever believes the gospel is firmly persuaded at once that it is god that speaks and his word they believe the first true knowledge of god comes by the gospel  and it is calculated to produce it it is much better contrived to make us understand what god is and what are his attributes than all his works put together for it gives light the entrance of thy word gives light divine revelation is too often considered as a sort of passive organ something like the sun moon and stars which are said to declare the glory of god  and there are several people in the world will with difficulty admit that we can know it to be from god till we learn it extra seipsum without itself  but the difficulty here is insurmountable and ends in atheism for when men depart from scripture itself to seek for the knowledge of its author  where do they land in eternal doubts and skepticism by faith we understand that the worlds were made by the word of god  by the knowledge of the sacred records we learn the character of their author and receive the certain proof that god made the world  but when we begin to seek the divine character among his works at first hand on purpose to settle the character of scripture we are obliged first to prove that the universe is his handy work  this is still more difficult to prove without help from the scripture than to find the character of the author of revelation without such aid the gospel seems to be suited to some capacity in us whereby it produces in our minds an assent to its truth by making known its author  this knowledge is not like opinion which is founded upon probability nor like conjecture which is grounded only on some probable marks of truth  but is founded upon certain understanding of facts concerning which there can be no reasonable doubt and on the testimony of one who neither will nor can deceive us  when this knowledge is obtained it is not like opinion which may vary with probability but it becomes a principle of action in the mind  and in its nature varies no more than the record on which it is founded it may have degrees according to the measure of divine manifestation  but as to its nature it is founded upon principles that are invariable it may increase or decline upon occasions but can never totally fail more than its first principles can be destroyed it is compared to the shining light which shines more and more unto the perfect day this knowledge begets a lasting esteem of christ on account of his many excellencies that are the sum of that heavenly wisdom  from the divine records the christian is informed that the redeemer is a divine person  fairer than the sons of men and more excellent than all mountains of prey  that he excells in wisdom power goodness and truth  but rests in his love and rejoiceth in mercy those who know jesus christ consider him not only as mighty to save but as the most excellent object of contemplation and delight  having in him every beauty which can give pleasure to the mind it was from a certain knowledge of this that david expressed himself so earnestly in these pathetic lines psalm xxvii   one thing have i desired of the lord and that will i seek after that all the days of my life i may dwell in the house of the lord to behold his beauty and enquire in his temple the christians esteem of jesus is founded upon what is amiable in his character  what is not more striking than it is sweet in this love and esteem are something distinct love which is the desire of enjoyment of any object that is agreeable considered at some distance is more engaged with what is striking than what is amiable  but when the object is obtained and all the striking parts of character appear mixed with sweetness and amiableness  then love rests in the object and becomes lasting esteem  when a miserable sinner under the apprehensions of guilt and the divine displeasure receives the intimation of the redeemers character as one who has paid his ransom and has delivered him from going down to the pit he is ready to be enamoured with his love and compassion  and admires him rather as one who has done him a real service than one who is intrinsickly worthy of his highest regard  but when he comes to consider his character more strictly after his surprise at his mercy is somewhat abated he comes to see that his chief happiness lies in being joined in fellowship with one who in all respects is so engaging that his soul will never need any thing more to satisfy its desires through an endless tract of duration when christ and his redemption is manifested in the soul the mind rests in the esteem of him  who is worthy of its most exalted regards  but this knowledge makes christians also esteem all that is christs  every appointment of his and every ordinance which bears the stamp of his authority are dear to them who know him  his character as a lawgiver who rules in mount zion is the object of their esteem  and therefore all his laws appear righteous it is not how agreeable some ordinances are to flesh and blood or how they may suit the ends of worldly policy and temporal interest that engages a christian to observe them  but whether they have the seal of christs appointment added to them the knowledge of christ our redeemer teaches all his children to consider obedience to him in observing his ordinances not as means which merely lead to glory  but a very part of glory itself  for it is their glory to keep his commandments in every stage of existence whatsoever the children of heavenly wisdom wisely consider that there is no difference between the militant state of christs church and that of the triumphant with respect to mens obligation to obey him  nor will they ever have any desire to be freed from his service  and therefore they consider these ordinances which are appointed to them in this life to observe as the only heavenly exercise they are capable of for the present  those who know jesus christ their redeemer are not taken with the splendor of rituals nor engaged with the pompous means of devotion  but are more concerned about the spirit and truth of religion than the elegance of external modes of worship when they come to the house of god they are more ready to hear than to give the sacrifice of fools the vocal praise of christian worship gives them more pleasure  because they can mutually join in that devotion than all the symphany of instrumental music the jewish sound of organs symbols and harps give no delight to a christians ear because christ has not commanded that mode of praise in the new testament sanctuary such as know christ crucified choose to direct their devotion by some express laws of his authorizing and will not venture to perform his service according to their own will and pleasure  they esteem all his precepts and promises  they say of his commandments that in all things they are right every promise is the object of a believers trust and confidence  and what their lord says they are able to receive as faithful sayings  because they know the veracity of the author they cheerfully trust his promise though many circumstances in providence may intervene seemingly unfavourable to the accomplishment of gods promise yet the knowledge they have of the divine character supports their confidence under every unfavourable circumstance  being satisfied concerning gods love toward them by his giving his son they conclude that with him he will freely give them all things  moreover they who have been favored with the discovery of christs character as their redeemer will love all the children of their heavenly father  for as they esteem him that begat they will also love them that are begotten this esteem is of the same kind toward all those who receive the truth in the love thereof and who bear the image of their heavenly father  and though the children of god may differ in their moral stature or have different views of some things  though they may have different gifts and various imperfections in this present state  yet they esteem one another on account of their common relation to the one father in jesus christ difference in outward circumstance or variance in opinion will not alter their opinion of one another  while they agree in the original principles of knowledge  namely the knowledge of christ crucified whenever men begin to disesteem one another and instead of loving one another do most heartily hate each other there is reason to fear something worse than difference in opinion  nothing but total ignorance of jesus christ will produce such a dismal effect mens opinions are what they cannot help more than they can add a cubit to their stature  and if we think them wrong we ought to pity them but not hate them christian love begets compassion for a brother when he errs and will not suffer the mind to remove its regards for what is only his misfortune  sect  d it produces peace and tranquillity of mind when christians have attained to the true knowledge of christ and the redemption he has obtained for them they receive full satisfaction concerning their peace with god through him  and are persuaded they shall not be brought into condemnation or in the language of the psalmist they shall not die but live and discover the works of the lord this occasions an inward cafe and satisfaction of soul  because god who is the chief good and whose anger is most to be dreaded is now reconciled through the blood of jesus to the guilty  when this great privilege is obtained the children of heavenly wisdom find no occasion to be troubled with what passes in the world  for this reason be they poor or rich weak or strong as to the things pertaining to this life they are content because their treasure is in heaven satisfaction concerning peace with our maker not only makes us easy ourselves but makes us behave easily toward others with whom we may be concerned it does not appear that persons who behave with severity toward their fellow man have any pleasure in contemplating the divine character  for all severity proceeds from a sourness of mind which the love of god subdues wherever it prevails when men called christians through a cruelty of disposition endeavor to hurt one another for conscience sake it argues they have but bad consciences for if their consciences were purified they would endeavor to follow peace with all men all true peace of mind arises from satisfaction with those things that are the object of moral contemplation there are two things especially which fall under this denomination  the relations we stand in to god  and the happiness or misery that arise to us from those relations when these appear favorable to us they make us happy when we contemplate them if unfavourable they make us unhappy  when upon enquiry it is found that the character of god appears opposite to what we find to be our own present leading character it must produce a very great uneasiness in the mind and make us unhappy if we find that god stands in the relation of a just and righteous judge to us and we in the relation of guilty sinners it will cause no little pain and uneasiness if we be not quite past feeling  but if it is found that he is related to us as a gracious and reconciled god through jesus christ bestowing pardon freely upon the guilty it will produce peace and satisfaction in the soul our happiness and misery entirely depend upon what relation we stand in to god and he to us to consider him as a just judge without perceiving his character as reconciled through his beloved son sets before us a very awful prospect  for in that character he condemns the guilty  but when he is considered as the lord god merciful and gracious in jesus christ he is represented as just and yet the justifier of the ungodly when this great point of peace with god is obtained and the intimation of it made to the conscience contentment with every other circumstance of life will be the necessary consequence this will dispose men to live peaceably as far as in them lies with every one it argues a bad conscience and corrupt heart to have a constant disposition to quarrel with others about things that are no ways momentous when we consider the connection of what has been said we shall not be able to give any other reason for men falling out with their fellow christians and brethren but that they know not jesus christ and are at variance with their maker  for were they in good terms with the almighty they would find no great difficulty to live peaceably with all men  and we may easily learn from observation that a good man is not at so much difficulty to live peaceably with his enemies as bad men and hypocrites are to live in peace with their most intimate friends whoever is fully persuaded of what jesus has done for them will not grudge to seek peace with their very foes  they know they cannot follow a better example than that of christ the various murmurings which prevail among nominal professors of religion only testify how little they are acquainted with that savior who died to make peace for men and shed his precious blood to obtain for them forgiveness of sin  there are many more effects which the manifestation of christ and redemption through him produce in the souls of those who believe the record concerning him  which i am obliged to leave out of this essay lest i should swell it to an undue size  i shall therefore finish it with observing that our whole conversation will be directed according to our knowledge and belief of this subject wherever it prevails as an article of religion in truth it will dispose the believers to walk as christ also walked it is one of those doctrines of grace that purify the heart and animates the whole conduct of christians  infidelity in this particular will not long lie concealed  for as a man thinks so is he  and he will show the abundance of his heart by the manner of his acting  but all who believe in christ will be careful to maintain good works  finis
