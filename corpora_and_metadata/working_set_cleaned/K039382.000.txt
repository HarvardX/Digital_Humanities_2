at the end of the street i knew her by the pink negligee but upon my crossing the way to speak to her she turned her head away laughed violently and drew the curtain in my face   sophia so so well said jealousy  aside arabella she was in haste i suppose to get to her engagement   tukely yes yes madam i imagine she had some engagement upon her hands  but sure madam her great desire to see her more agreeable friends need not be attended with contempt and disregard to the rest of her acquaintance   arabella indeed mr tukely i have so many caprices and follies of my own that i cannot possibly answer for my cousins too   sophia well said bell  aside tukely answer miss  no heaven forbid you should  for my part i have given up all my hopes as a lover and only now feel for her as a friend  and indeed as a friend a sincere friend  i cannot but say that going out in a hackney chair without a servant and endeavoring to conceal herself is somewhat incompatible with miss sophys rank and reputation  this i speak as a friend  not as a lover miss bell  pray mind that   arabella i see it very plainly mr tukely  and it gives me great pleasure that you can be so indifferent in your love and yet so jealous in your friendship   tukely you do me honor miss by your good opinion  walks about and sees sophy who is that pray   arabella a gentleman who is waiting for sophy   tukely i think she has gentlemen waiting for her every where   sophia i am afraid sir coming up to him with her glass you will excuse me that notwithstanding your declaration and this ladys compliments there is a little of the devil called jealousy at the bottom of all this uneasiness   tukely sir    sophia i say sir wear your cloak as long as you please the hoof will peep out take my word for it   tukely upon my word sir you are pleased to honor me with a familiarity which i neither expected or indeed desired upon so slight an acquaintance   sophia i dare swear you did not  turns off and hums a tune tukely i dont understand this   arabella this is beyond expectation   aside sophia i presume sir you never was out of england   picking her teeth tukely i presume sir that you are mistaken  i never was so foolishly fond of my own country to think that nothing good was to be had out of it nor so shamefully ungrateful to it to prefer the vices and fopperies of every other nation to the peculiar advantages of my own   sophia ha ha well said old england in faith  now madam if this gentleman would put this speech into a farce and properly lard it with roast beef and liberty i would engage the galleries would roar and halloo at it for half an hour together  ha ha ha   arabella now the storms coming  aside tukely if you are not engaged sir well adjourn to the next tavern and write this farce between us   sophia i fancy sir by the information of your face that you are more inclined to tragedy than comedy    tukely i shall be inclined to treat you very ill if you dont walk out with me   sophia i have been treated so very ill already in the little conversation i have had with you that you must excuse my walking out for more of it but if you will persuade the lady to leave the room i will put you to death  damme   going up to him arabella for heavens sake what is the matter gentlemen   tukely what can i do with this fellow   sophia madam dont be alarmed  this affair will be very short  i am always expeditious and will cut his throat without shocking you in the least  come sir draws if you will not defend yourself i must kick you about the room  advancing tukely respect for

your spirit transports me  this will be a busy and i hope a happy day for me i have appointed no less than five ladies to meet me at the widow damplys to each of whom as well as yourself the accomplished mr daffodil has presented his heart the value of which i am resolved to convince em of this night for the sake of the whole sex   sophia pooh pooh that is the old story  you are so prejudiced    tukely i am afraid it is you who are prejudiced madam for if you will believe your own eyes and ears    sophia that i will i assure you  i shall visit him immediately  he thinks me in the country and to confirm it i will write to him as from thence  but ask me no more questions about what i have done and what is to be done for i have not a moment to lose and so my good friend

imagine with all their wise discoveries that daffodil is as faithful a lover as he is an accomplished gentleman  i pity these poor deceived women with all my heart  but how will they stare when they find that he has artfully pretended a regard for them the better to conceal his real passion for me  they will certainly tear my eyes out and what will cousin sophy say to me when we are obliged to declare our passion no matter what  it is the fortune of war  and i shall only serve her as she and every other friend would serve me in the same situation   a little cheating never is a sin at love
