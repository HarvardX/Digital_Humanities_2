durham banks view of durham banks  introduction durham is a maritime county and takes its name from the city of durham commonly called the bishopric and sometimes the county palatine  the description given by camden is to the following effect camdens brit gibsons edition      vol ii p      it lies north of yorkshire and is shaped like a triangle geographers deal with countries as astronomers with their asterismes and fancy them into shapes as italy into a mans leg spain into an oxhyde and the form of this bishopric into a or an equilateral triangle it lies in the bosom of the german neptune and embraced between the arms of the two crystal rivers teese and derwent  legend of st cuthbert    the apex or top whereof lies to the west being formed there by the meeting of the north boundary and the head of the river tees the southern side is wholly bounded by the course of the tees the northern side from about the point of the angle forms a line to the river derwent and then is bounded by that river till it receives the rivulet called chopwell or milkburn and so full north to the river tyne the basis of this triangle to the east is formed by the shore of the german ocean  modern geographers have laid down the abuttals so variously that in regard to the northwest point we can in general only say the river tees totally separates the county of durham from westmorland and yorkshire and a very narrow point of cumberland intervenes between that river and the confines of northumberland a space in which the proprietors are not well ascertained of their real boundaries on the other sides camdens description is accurate  the parts of this county extended into the upper point or apex of the triangle camden describes camd brit ibid to consist of naked lands the woods few the hills bald but not destitute of veins of iron ore whilst the valleys produce plenty of grass the english appenines intersecting the country at this angle at the distance of two hundred years we cannot wonder at this picture of our county or the ignorance of naturalists in regard to its produce and riches the contrast we shall draw it is hoped will prove interesting our author then proceeds to describe the eastern side or basis of the triangle where he observes as well as to the south the soil by tillage is rendered fertile and the country enamelled with meadows cornfieldsd and pastures and graced with many towns the bowels of the earth abounding in coal such is the imperfect account given by this great writer  the magna britannia describes this county to be thirtyfive miles in length thirty in breadth and about one hundred and seven in circumference another account says it is thirtynine miles long and thirtyfive broad containing nine hundred and fiftyeight square miles and six hundred and ten thousand acres of land and comprehending one city eleven other market towns fiftytwo parishes and twentyone chapels two hundred and twentythree villages nineteen thousand nine

ward and chester ward we know no reason why the several districts took those denominations or derived their names from places of inferior consequence and distinction  the air of the county is generally healthy though cold on the hills and according to some authors that of the western parts sharper than that of the east it is well watered by rivers and brooks the chief of which are the tees and were hollinsheds description of these two rivers and the several streams that join them is so accurate that we cannot omit the same  the these a river that bears and feeds an excellent salmon rises in the black lowes above two miles flat west of the southerlie head of were called burdop and south of the head of west alen and thence runs through tildale forest and taking in the langdonwater from northwdst it runs to durtpit chapel to newbiggin and so to middleton receiving by west of each of these a rill coming from by north of which the last is called hude and likewise the lune afterward by southwest that rises at three several places whereof the first is in the borders of westmerland and there called arnegillbecke the second more southerlie named lunebecke and the third by south at bandor skarthhill and meeting all above arnegillhouse they run together in one bottom to lathekirkebridge and then into the these having therefore met with these it runs to mickleton and there taking in the skirkwithwater it goes to rombaldkirke crossing there also one rill and the banderbrooke by southwest and then going to morewoodhag and morewoodparke till it come to bernards castle here also it receives the thuresgillwater coming east of rerecrosse in yorkshire from the spittle in stanmore by crag almost southwest and being united with the these it goes by stratford eglesdon rokesbie thorpe wickliffe ovington winston and between barfurth and gainfurth meets with another rill that comes from langleie forest between rabie castle and standorpe of whose name i have no knowledge but to proceed the these being past ramfurth runs between persore and cliffe and in the way to croftsbridge takes in the skerne a pretty water which rises above trimdon and goes by fishburne bradburie preston braforton skirmingham the burdons haughton and darlington and there finally meeting with the cockebecke or dare it falls in the these beneath stapleton before it come at croftsbridge and as it should seem is the same which leland calls gretteie or grettie from thence it runs to sockburne nether dunsleie middletonrow newsham yarne crossing a brook from levenbridge called levin or leuinus in latin whose crinkling course is notable and the stream of some called thorpe after this the these hastes on to barwic preston thorn abbeie and arsham which stands on the southeast side of the river almost between the falls of two waters whereof one descends from west hartburne by long newton elton and stockton the other from stillington or shillington by whitton thorpe blackeston billingham and norton from arsham finally it goes to bellasis middleburgh and so into the sea  ptolomie writing of the were calls it vedra it rises of three heads in kelloppeslawhill whereof the most southerlie is called burdop the middlemost wallop and the northerliest kellop which uniting themselves about st johns chapel or a little by west thereof their confluence runs through stanhopeparke by east yate and so to frosterlie but yer it come there it receives three rilles from the north in weredale whereof one comes in by stanhope another west of woodcrofthall and the third at frosterlie aforementioned and a little beneath these a fourth on the southside which descends from southwest by bolliop bishopsleie millhouses and landew being therefore united all with the were this stream goes on to wolsingham there taking in the wascropburne beside another at bradleie the third at harpleiehall and these on the northside and the fourth between witton and witton castle called bedburne coming by hamsterleie whereby this river does now wax very great going therefore from hence it hastes to bishops akeland and beneath it receives the garondlesse which rises six miles by west of akeland castle and running south thereof passes by westakeland st helens akeland st andrews akeland and bishops akeland and then into the were which goes to newfield and willington near unto this place also and somewhat beneath sunderland the were crosses one brook from southwest by het coxseie cornefurth tursdale and croxdale and two other from by northwest in one botome whereof the first comes from above ash by langleie the other called coue from above kinchleie by newbiggin lanchester north langley and through beareparke and so meeting beneath kelleie or hedleie with the other they fall both as one into the were between south sunderland and burnall from hence our river goes on to howghwell shirkeleie old duresme and there taking in the piddingbrooke by northeast it goes to duresme finkeleie harbarhouse lumleie castle where it meets with the pilis whose heads are united between pelton and whitwell and after called hedleie and from thence to lampton harraton the beddikes ufferton hiltonparke bishops weremouth and so into the sea between north sunderland and north weremouth town which now is called monk weremouth    both abounding with fish and particularly with trout

the history and antiquities of the county palatine of durham the city of durham claims our first attention it is in easington ward and lies near the center of the county in latitude     0 and      west longitude from london from whatever quarter the traveller approaches this place he is struck with its elegant situation and the grandeur of some of its public buildings a few paces from the south road this english zion makes a noble appearance in the center the castle and cathedral crown a very lofty eminence girt by the two streets called the baileys enclosed with the remains of the ancient city walls and skirted with hanging gardens and plantations which descend to the river were in this point of view exhibiting the figure of a horseshoe this reverend aged abbey is seated in the heart of the city advanced upon the shoulders of an high hill and encompassed again with the higher hills that he that has seen the situation of this city has seen the map of sion and may save a journey to

extended and terminated by the handsome church of st oswald at the bottom runs oldelvet across the bridge are the streets of claypeth and st giles which climb the more distant eminence the church terminating the line of buildings the slopes of the hills are beautified with hanging gardens and rich meadows newtonhall one of the seats of sir henry liddell bart with its adjacent plantations fills the nearer background behind which a fine cultivated country is discovered lengthening the prospect to the distance of ten miles on which pensharhill with its peaked brow is a beautiful object to form

part is crossed by framwelgate bridge of two eliptic arches crookhall a seat of one of the family of hopper is seen on the rivers banks with the woodlands of newtonhall on the more distant ground to the left of which the sweet villa of francis johnson esquire at aykleyheads is seen surrounded with irregular mounts here it is alleged was a drulical grove the brrow is now very conspicuous and resembling those given by stuelty t  and  and rising plantations  approaching the city from the north it has the most romantic and uncommon appearance it seems to be scattered over a multitude of irregular hills for the ground by which it is approached is thrown up into round mounts and we discover various parts of the town the castle and churches through several valleys in one point of view so that they appear like so many distinct places the west front of the castle is seen on the summit of a ragged and steep rock with some parts of the cathedral and the street of st giles as if totally unconnected with the rest of the town is spread over the brow of a distant eminence the hollow passes amongst the hills on the northwest of the city afford beautiful and picturesque prospects at castlechair where the view is much confined the castle and cathedral have a noble appearance the octagon tower of the former with the mound on which it is placed have a grand effect on the eminence opposite to shawwood the view just mentioned is enlarged yet the distant branches of the town being intercepted by rising grounds leave the principal objects in the most distinct and picturesque arrangement approaching from the east down the street of st giles we command the second noblest view of the city in front the river were forms a fine canal through a rich vale crossed by elvet bridge

banks of elvet and the church flanked by a distant forest of oaks and the groves which hang on the margin of the river on the right is a view of newtonhall and the adjacent grounds  to this general description more minute particulars will be added as we pass through the city  a short view of historical facts relative to this place as each circumstance arose in the respective aeras of our prelates is given in due order in the preceding volume of this work it is to be observed that the first mention as to time made by old writers of the name of durham or duresme according to the language of those days is by hollinshed in the reign of athelstan when speaking of sithrics the charter granted by hugh pudsey bishop of durham to the burgesses of the city of durham the confirmation of bishop pudseys charter to the burgesses of the city of durham by pope alexander  d  sons anlaf and godred he says godred with a power of men entering into northumberland besieged the city of duresme soliciting the citizens to receive him which they would gladly have done if they had not perceived how he was not of power able to resist the puissance of king athelstan hollinsheds hist p      it is evident from circumstances that this author adopted a wrong name for the capital of deira for the most approved historians concur in relating that godred arrived at york where some of his partisans held the castle but on athelstans approaching malmsbury says it was surrendered and demolished even to the ground and godred in despair took to piratical courses and a roving life at sea rapin vol i p  00  malms p  0  sax an  hoved  hunting  smollet  to edit p  00   we have not the least evidence of any town where durham now stands before the monks rested with the remains of st cuthbert after the danish invasion it was also remarked in the course of this work that there is a place adjacent to the present city called old durham but we have neither traces in history nor records to show that any town existed there previous to st cuthberts arrival the legendary tale alone supported by the effigies on the northwest tower of the transept of the cathedral church which will be described when that edifice is treated of relates that after the revelation or vision at wedelau according to symeons text but werdele by others and described to lie east of durham the monks were much at a loss to find the place pointed out by the oracle where they should rest from their labor the name of dunholme then said to be given them was not known to any if they then lay at warden law which from much similarity of name some have conceived was the place of the vision it was within eight miles if on the banks of the were where we shall by some observations attempt to ground a supposition that the monks halted it was to the east of the city at a very little distance for that river from its source flows almost due east to bishopauckland and from thence almost due north to old durham it would have been strange if deiraham duresme or dunholme a place named from the kingdom of deira in which it was situated or some such memorable distinction had then stood on the site of old durham and was not known to the inhabitants within so small a distance as chester the last residence of the monks the discovery of the place of their destination occurred to the wanderers accidentally as the legend relates for whilst they traveled through the country with uncertain steps a woman seeking her cow was informed by a person she met that she would find it in dunholme the astonished monks rejoiced at the propitious voice and followed their fortunate guide where indeed they found a country flowing with milk and honey so much for the legend which we would not have troubled the reader with but it leads to an argument that the effigies on the church were placed there in commemoration of the happy possession of the rich meads and valleys on the were which could not be more aptly expressed in emblem than by the figure of the bountiful cow distending her udder to dispense charitable gifts to mankind it was emblematical of the rich country they had obtained of the gracious gifts of providence decreed to them and the holy benevolence of the church in pursuance of this idea it is probable the monks on discovering their destined residence with the pious host which accompanied them sat down on the plains southeast of the present city by the brink of the river and there erected themselves habitations till they could build a church wherein to deposite the saints remains this conjecture has a strict correspondence not only with the name of old durham but of the burgus vetus which we shall point out from several records afterward granted to the convent on the one side of this plain was a fortress perhaps of no less antiquity than the times we are speaking of called the maiden castle in the gentlemans magazine for the year      the origin of the name maiden when annexed to way or castle is learnedly defined by that great antiquary mr pegge under his then signature of gemsege particularly he says to risque a conjecture upon a point so obscure perhaps it may come from the british word mad pulcher or beautiful hence possibly may come the anglosaxon word maid and maiden virgo which in that case answers exactly to our present expressions a fair one and in the plural the fair a sense undoubtedly very well accommodated to all the three names of maidencastle maidenway and maidenhold   the remains of which are described in the sequel and on the other side a peel or castle as is presumed from the name of the eminence called the peellaw or castlehill though no traces of any such erection are at this time to be seen or found in the forest of oak that grows on the hill the river runs between the eminences and almost fills the whole intervening space the remains of extensive breastworks and trenches are to be seen a little farther up the vale such as the people of that age used to cast up for the defense of their habitations and not far distant is an eminence called montjoye from whence the wanderers obtained a view of the hill of zion whereon st cuthbert was to rest for ever mr cade of durham in his tract on the roman roads of this county published in the archaeologia vol vii p    has taken great pains to trace the works and entertains an idea that they were the vestiges of a roman wintercamp  for the satisfaction of our readers we shall extract his letter on the subject when we describe those places wardenlaw lies several points to the northeast of the city of durham and on the wrong side of the river for the monks to approach chester from ripon the fords are dangerous and uncertain and even impassable at certain seasons by travelers on foot wardenlaw is also at a greater distance from ripon by eight miles than durham such circumstances counterpoise the apparent similarity of names and induce a belief that as the religious troop would cross the river tees either at neseham croft or piercebridge they would seek the fordable passes of the river were near durham and that wedelau werdale and such other names as we find in ancient authors express the dale of were though names grow corrupt yet points of the compass must remain and if the pious host sat down east of durham on the banks of the were there was no other ground so situated but in the vicinity of old durham this argument shall not be pressed further till we come to describe the ground in our progress through the county  dunholme or the eminence on which st cuthbert was to rest is described to us as being insufficient for the reception of the multitude that attended the saint till they had cut down the thickets and forests which grew upon the skirts of the hill the first work the pious laborers engaged in was to erect an ark or tabernacle with timber and boughs of trees where they deposited the saints body after which they built a complete edifice similar to the churches of that age which was called the white church this transaction all the monkish writers fix to the year     the learned editor of camden adds and to omit the many pretended miracles and other passages of less moment he symeon says further that the first church erected at dunholm by bishop aldwin was facta citissime de virgis ecclesiola a little church quickly made of rods just such another structure as that which is said to have been first built at glastenbury whereof sir henry spelman has given us a draught qui locus non erat inhabitatus vel aedisicatus sed densissima undiq sylva totum occupavit  elenchus liber cui tit liber ruber dun    it does not appear that any habitations were erected for the people on the mount where the church was built for a considerable time after their coming to dunholme for we are told in the course of three years from the date of the first tabernacle that a church of stonework was begun and dedicated by bishop aldun wherein the saints remains were deposited according to the course of events exhibited by the ancient writers it was not till after the foundation of alduns church was laid that the forest which grew round the eminence was cut down and the skirts of the hill were rendered sit for human habitation much labor was expended and all the inhabitants between coquet and tees rivers at the command of the earl of northumberland are said to have been employed therein workmen drawn from a tract of country not less than fifty miles in length such was the mighty concourse which on that occasion crowded the banks of the were the topography of dunholme at that time was that it was more beholding to nature for fortification than fertility where thick woods both hindered the stars from viewing the earth and the earth from the prospect of heaven here the monks with extemporary devotion instead of a church built an arbor of boughs for st cuthbert and from thence translated it into whitkyrk for three years while aldwinus the bishop raised no small building of stone work for his cathedral church where all the people between coqued and tees three years were at work and were paid for their pains with treasure in heaven than which there was never a dearer or cheaper way to build churches into this new basilica st cuthberts restless body in the three hundred and ninth year after his first burial was with all funeral pomp enshrined  legend of st cuthbert    from the above circumstances we are led to date the rise of the town of durham in the opening of the eleventh century bishop aldun did not live to see his design completed but left the western part of the edifice after eighteen years pious care for his successors to finish  we hear nothing further of the town of durham till the year  0 0 when some authors say it was attacked by duncan of scotland and it seems there were then fortifications for the townsmen as reported sustained the invaders assaults for a long time and at length made a victorious sally whereby the enemy were totally routed the heads of such scots leaders as fell or were taken prisoners were sixed on poles round the marketplace the eminence chosen for the first buildings was so steep on every side but one that it was easily defended against the attacks of an enemy the weakest part was on the northeast where claypeth or clayportgate now stands being on the neck of land between the streams of the river this neck from brink to brink of the were is not much above  00 paces in width in its present state and there are sufficient appearances on the adjacent ground to encourage a conjecture that a sluice or moat crossed this narrow part whereby the whole city could on occasion be completely insulated the name of clayport as it is styled in all the ancient writers appears to be a corruption of cluerport or the gate of the sluice cleur being a northcountry word in acceptance for a sluicegate or sluiceboard by which a damhead is stopped leland who visited this country in his itinerary says iin vol i p     the town self of duresme stondith on a rocky hille and stondith as men cum from the south cuntre on the ripe of were the which water so with his course natural in a botom windith about that from elvet a great stone bridge of    arches it crepith about the town to framagate bridge of   arches also on were that betwixt these   bridges or a little lower at st nicholas the town except the lenght of an arrowshot is brought in insulam and some hold opinion that of ancient time were ran from the place where now elvet bridge is strait down by st nicholas now stonding on a hille and that the other course part for policy and part by digging of stones for building of the town and minstre was made a valley and so the water course was conveyid that way but i approve not full this conjecture leland doubting the truth of the report does not express his opinion concerning the neck of land which he mentions symeon who gives us the account of the beforementioned attack on durham takes no notice of any fort or stronghold which contributed to the gallant defense of the inhabitants but it is probable the mound on which the octagonal tower of the castle stands was cotemporary with the church and perhaps formed of the soil which was necessarily moved when the foundations of that structure were laid at warwick there is a mound of the same form with terraces similar to those at durham and dugdale warwickshire p  0  tells us if it was presumption to carry its antiquity higher to refer the foundation thereof to the renowned lady ethelstede daughter of king alfred and lady of the mercians i am sure will not in regard it appears that she in     scil in the   th year of king edward the elder caused the dungeon to be made which is a strong tower or platform upon a large and high mount of earth artificially raised such being usually placed toward the side of a castle or fort which is least defensible the substance whereof is yet to be seen this passage is quoted to show the reader there was an example for the people to follow and that such mounts were of that antiquity it is said to be the opinion of the ingenious mr wright of byersgreen author of louthiania  that this was a danish mount or fort but we have no traces in history of that people having a residence here and indeed the former arguments hold against it as such a work would have rendered the place notorious to the monks of chester at the distance of six miles  the next event noted in history wherein durham is distinguished was in the year  0   after the coming in of william the norman when he sent down cumin as governor of northumberland with a guard of  00 veteran norman soldiers despising bishop egelwins caution and advice cumin entered the city with marks of cruelty and tyranny and through the insolence of his own selfsufficiency permitted his troops to give themselves up to rioting and wantonness they forcibly took possession of the houses were dispersed through every quarter of the city and committed various enormities against the inhabitants the normans overcome with drunkenness and revelling were totally off their guard whilst the people of the adjacent country arming themselves assembled in the night and at the dawn of day forced the gates of the city fell upon the normans when they suspected no violence and put them to the sword so that the streets were filled with blood and carcases the house where the earl lodged was set on fire and those within endeavoring to fly were immediately slain only one wounded person of the whole band escaping death when the ruthless tyrant william greedy of revenge marched his army northward the affrighted inhabitants of durham fled the city camd brit  and the monks forsook their convent leaving the normans a melancholy solitude on which to wreak their vengeance by fire and destruction as soon as the troops retired the inhabitants came from their hiding places and the religious host brought back their holy charge after an absence of four months  the king having appointed walcher to the bishopric on his return from an expedition against malcolm of scotland in  0   ordered a castle or fortress to be built at durham at once to protect the bishop and his convent to keep the people in subjection and to awe the northern territories this place being esteemed a fit situation for a barrier it is certain such an edifice was begun about that period of time but we have no information of what form it was though the octagonal figure is not unusual in the norman buildings it seems camden apprehended the castle directed to be built by william was not founded on the site of any ancient fortress his words being in eminentiori collis part extruxit but that a more elevated situation was chosen for the new bulwark than the stronghold alluded to by gulielmus gemiticencis whose words he quotes describing the fortress from whence he says the english dissatisfied with the norman yoke made frequent sallies and kept themselves close there waiting for the expected approach of the danes that it was in a part of the country inaccessible by reason of woods and waters that it had a strong rampire round it which they called dunholme this account seems to strengthen the former arguments william de malmsbury whom camden quotes and who lived about that time gives us this description of the city durham is a hill rising gradually from out the valley to its summit and notwithstanding by its rugged situation and broken rocks all access for an enemy is cut off yet lately they have built a castle upon a hill at whose foot runs an excellent river dugdale further speaking of the castle of warwick says in those days in the saxons time i mean were very few such defensible places as we now call castles that being a french name so that though the english were a bold and warlike people yet for want of the like strongholds were they much less able to resist their enemies which defect gave great advantage to the norman conqueror after his victory at hastings whereof he was so sensible that he neglected not to raise store of such forts through the whole realm as i have elsewhere observed amongst which this at warwick was not the least  bishop walchers assumption of the civil jurisdiction in the character of palatine it is apprehended brought on the tragical catastrophe before related see vol i p   0  in the month of may  0 0 and the city of durham after his death sustained the assault of the rioters for four days who not able to make any impression dispersed themselves  william de carilepho who succeeded in the bishopric was among the malcontents on the accession of william rufus after the king had quelled the southern insurrections he sent an army into the north which laid siege to durham and soon reduced the place the bishop flying into normandy on this occasion the temporalties of the sea were seized into the hands of the crown john de tailbois and ernesius de burone were made governors of the castle and palatinate and it was not till the year  0   that the bishop was restored soon after that event he granted or if the ancient authorities are not confused on this subject rather regranted to the convent elvet in the order of a borough where the monks should have forty merchants houses or tradesmens shops distinct and separate from the bishops borough of durham that they might trade there freed from duties payable to the bishop and his successors linwood upon the provincial ut singula de sensibus speaks to this effect aliqui interpretantur burgum esse castum vel locum ubi sunt crebra casta vel dicitur burgus ubi sunt per limits habitucula plura constituta but afterward defines it thus burgus dici potest villa quoecunq alia in civitate in qua est universitas approbata  some derive it from the greek word  i e turris see skene de verb signif  verstegan in his restitution of decayed intelligence says burg or burgh whereof we take our borough metaphorically signifies a town having a wall or some kind of a closure about it all places that in old time had amongst our ancestors the name of borough were one way or other fenced or fortified  it is doubtful whether before the statute of acton burnell goods were devisable but in ancient boroughs where by prescriptive custom they were usually devised    though we have no previous account of the borough of durham vol i p     yet by inference we may determine that such borough existed with exclusive privileges even till the institution of the borough of elvet held an entire trade how this diminution was relished we are not informed nor how the new borough supported its authority  in the time of bishop flambard bishop flambard was consecrated a d  0   and died       whilst the temporalties were in the hands of the crown it appears by the guardians accounts the borough of durham sustained considerable damage by fire vol i p      after the bishops restoration to the sea he improved the fortifications of the city by extending the walls between the church and the castle he removed all the houses on the area between those two edifices and levelled the ground he fortified the castle with a moat strengthened the banks of the river and built the beautiful bridge called framwellgatebridge  in april      this city entertained the members of congress when articles of peace were agreed upon maud queen of england with a great number of barons on the part of that crown and prince henry with many scotch nobles on the other part being present  king henry ii during his displeasure with bishop pudsey took possession of the castle and city of durham and on various pretexts repeatedly deprived him of the custody of this strong place it was a custom for the burgesses on the demise of a prelate to deposite the keys of the city gates at the shrine of st cuthbert on the death of bishop pudsey the officers of the crown who had seized the temporalties took violent possession of the keys contrary to the ancient usage as the election of a prelate was studiously delayed and much oppression

the gates of a walled town and under the protection of a fortress where they carried on a secure trade and perhaps held certain customs established by successive prelates by this charter of which the

in very distant antiquity and in the saxon times given to the lord for his better maintenance in war most of the ancient writers have distinguished heriots in two branches heriot custom and heriot service law definitions have little right to a place here it must suffice to say that both denominate an estate of inheritance and the heriot service a feesimple but the fourth exemption by this

the county palatine of durham is and time out of mind has been an ancient city of good fame and the burgesses men and inhabitants of the said city together with those of framwelgate have had and enjoyed diverse rights jurisdictions liberties and privileges as well by prescription as by virtue of diverse charters grants and confirmations as well from us as several of our predecessors bishops of durham and the burgesses men and inhabitants in time past have suffered great damage by reason of the defect of some of the said charters and fearing lest in time to come they should be molested in the enjoyment of such their liberties and free customs for want of publication and other causes they have therefore humbly entreated us to express in special words what the said liberties and free customs are and to grant the same to the said burgesses and inhabitants and their successors and to incorporate them etc by this charter he constituted and granted that the burgesses and inhabitants should be one body politic and corporate consisting of a mayor twelve aldermen and commonalty to continue for ever by the name of mayor aldermen and commonalty of the city of durham and framwelgate and by that title to plead and be impleaded in all courts of law within the county with power to purchase lands not exceeding the yearly value of  00 marks and to have a common seal hugh wright was

two of the carpenters and joiners two of the free masons and rough masons inhabitants of the city and framwelgate which with the mayor and aldermen should form a common council for the said city and on the  th day of october yearly to choose a mayor out of the body of the said aldermen it being requisite to have seven aldermen in the majority of votes on that occasion with a power for a like majority to deprive or suspend the mayor for any offense committed in his office and on such occasion or on the death of the mayor another chief magistrate should be in like manner elected within eleven days from the time of such deprivation to supply that year and within three days after such election to be sworn before the bishop for the time being or on the sea being vacant or the bishop being in distant parts then before the chancellor of the county palatine or on his absence out of the jurisdiction before the aldermen and the twentyfour commoncouncilmen or the major part of them on the fifth day of october yearly the said mayor aldermen and common council are directed to choose two sergeants on the death of a common councilman the mayor and aldermen within twenty days are to nominate one in his stead out of the same trade and on the vacancy of an alderman within the same time to nominate another out of the burgesses and inhabitants of the said city and framwelgate any person elected mayor or alderman and refusing to take upon him the office is made subject to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds to be levied on the desaulters goods and chattles or committed to the gaol at durham till the same is paid and such ines to be applied to the public use of the city they were also authorized to make laws statutes and ordinances for the better government of the city and the markets and fairs therein and all officers mysteries artificers and inhabitants and for regulating their several trades and mysteries and the due preservation and management of the lands and possessions of the said body corporate and for the better maintenance state and dignity of the said mayor aldermen and commonalty the same charter grants them all courts fairs markets tolls perquisites stallages pontages passages customs and all and singular liberties franchises profits commodities emoluments and free customs which at any time before the date thereof the burgesses had enjoyed or the bailiffs or aldermen of the city had held and used by virtue of any preceding charter or by means of any custom or prescriptive right whatsoever and that the said mayor aldermen and commonalty and their successors should hold their court within the city from fifteen days to fifteen days for ever and therein before their steward to hear and determine all actions suits quarrels and demands which might arise within the said city and framwelgate the sergeants having power to serve process and enter into the lands possessions or shops of the parties to satisfy the executions or judgments of the said court or to attach their bodies and commit them to prison they were also empowered to take cognizance of all pleas as well real as personal or mixed in the said court and have equal authority within their precincts as any other courts of the county palatine of durham had the steward was also authorized to punish the officers and ministers of the court by fine or imprisonment and all such fines and profits were granted to the said mayor aldermen and commonalty with view of frankpledge to be holden by their steward within the precincts of the city twice a year

courts were also thereby granted to them also a market weekly die sabbathi on saturday and three yearly fairs on the days appointed by bishop pilkingtons charter see p     with the profits and perquisites thereof and every mayor for the time being was made clerk of the market to enjoy the profits thereof  this charter received royal confirmation by letters patent dated at westminster the   th day of february   0  though it is apprehended the bishop was competent to make his charter without the aid of the crown and therefore this badge of honor after the gilding of its dignity was removed was no better than a scab on the constitution and privileges of the palatinate  notwithstanding the preceding charters the bishops and their officers or lessees continued to take the tolls and dues of goods coming into the markets within the borough and to appoint a bailliff of the borough and clerk of the market the record richardus neile dei gra ep dun etc sciatis etc dedimus et

tolls under a lease granted by richard neile bishop of durham dated  d oct   cha i      under the yearly rent of  0 l the defendants alleged that the corn of which the toll was demanded was not sold in the market but by private contract and delivered at the buyers house who lived in the limits of the borough the following decree was made it appeared to this court that scavadge corn is an ancient duty time out of mind had and received by the bishop of durham for the time being his servants tenants or farmers of the said borough markets or fayres for all manner of corn and grain brought into the said markets and sayres and otherwise sold in the said city of durham that the defendant forster besides other payments which were proved did pay scavadge corn for  0 bushells of corn which were brought to her in the weekday and not on the markett day and made agreement for the said scavadge corn and was to pay and did pay in lewe thereof for some quantities of the said corn after the rate of one penny for every bushel of corn and grain she bought in the said markett or was brought unto her and it then appeared that the bringinge in of corn on the week day was to the manifest preventinge and hinderinge of the said compts being farmers of the said scavadge corn of the said duty and olls of the said corn by ancient custom had and received as aforesaid and did much tend to the inhancing of the prices of corn and grain and was and is contrary to a proclamation made in the sixth year of his maj reign that now is which is yet in force whereupon and to the end this court might be better informed touching such order and proceedings as is elsewhere in matters of this nature etc this court did think fit to respitt the final determination of the said differences until this sittinge etc therefore upon due consideration had of the proofs already made as aforesaid and after perusal of diverse suits and controversies which formerly had been moved and were then depending as well at the common law as also in his maj court of the duchy chamber between rich prance als prince plaintiff and major nglebie deputy bailiff of knaisbrough in the county of york and others being the scavangers or gatherers of the markett sweepings or handlawcorne of knaisbrough aforesaid defendants touching the takeinge and distreyninge of certain corn in sacks of the said richard which was brought to the market of knaisbrough to be sold for a due of markett sweepings or handlawecorne claimed by the defendants as scavengers or gatherers of the said duty for the time being it is ordered and decreed by the right hon sir rich huton knt one of his maj justices of the court of common pleas at westminster and chancellor of the county palatine of durham and sadberge that if the said defendants or any other person or persons do at any time henceforth bring into the said city or borough or suburbs of the same any corn or grain of what nature or kind soever to be sold or to be delivered to any person or persons upon any bargain or contracte for the same shall before such delivery thereof present the said corn or grain in the public markett place within the said city where such corn or grain is used or accustomed to be brought and sold in the markett days as aforesaid and thereof shall give notice to the common officer or the gatherer or taker of such scavadge corn and after such notice given shall stay there a convenient time to the end the complts and others the farmers aforesaid their servants or agents may take their scavadge corn thereof and because this court was informed that the dish now used for the taking of the said scavadge or savell corn did conteyne much more than the ancient dish wherewith the said savell or scavadge corn was usually taken and received did conteyne and that the same is now reduced to the ancient measure of a pint dish it is therefore likewise ordered by mr chancellor that the said dish being of the measure of a pint only shall be from henceforth continuallye and that quantity and proportion to be taken for every bushel of the corn and grain so sold on the said markett and fair days and of every bushel of corn bought and delivered as aforesaid on the said week days which are neither markett nor fair days shall conteyne only a pynte for every bushel and so proportionable according to that rate and no more the bushel hear conteyinge    gallons at the least and that no scavadge corn shall be taken challenged or demanded of any thing there brought to he sold whatsoever other than of corn grain oatemeale and salt only and that not of any less quantity thereof then of a bushel at the least unless the owner shall at any time bring a bushel or more to be sold and of purpose to defraud and defeat the said duty shall divide the same to be sold by peeks or lesser quantities than a bushel and it is further ordered by this course that the said pynte dish shall not be uppheaped but by hand stroke and even sickn by the taker thereof and that the said dish shall be sealed and brought to the head burrowe court to be holden for the said city and burrowe of durham next after the feast of st michael the archangel yearlie to be viewed by the then mayor steward and clerk of the said court and the suitors there present to conteyne no more quantity then only a pynte as aforesaid and this court does further order and set down that when it shall happen that the duty of scavadge corn has been taken one markett day and that the corn be not sold but left unsould bona fide in the city or suburbs and kept until the next markett day and then brought again to be sold the said next markett day that no more scavadge corn shall be taken for the same corn for which the said duty of scavadge was paid and whereas it was complained to this court that such as brought corn to be sold on the said markett or fair days were oftentimes constreyned to stay until one or two of the clock in the afternoon before they might vent or sell their said corn in regard the markett bell has not been sooner runge and this court was then moved to appoint a certain hour for the most convenience and time the corn bell should be rung the rather for that as was alleged sundry persons in the winter season whose dwellings are somewhat more remote from the said city have been constreyned by the late ringing of the said bell to stay in the town all night to their needless charge and so to ride home on the sunday upon consideration had whereof it is now likewise further ordered by the court that the said markett bell or corn bell shall for ever hereafter be runge at    oclocke or near thereupon and if the said bell shall not be runge at twelve oclock or near that time that then it shall be lawful for every one to sell their corn at their pleasure but that no corn shall be sold or carried away before the hour of twelve of the clock and scavadge duty thereof taken under the danger and penalty that the same was subject unto before if it had been sold before the markett bell or corn bell had been runge and lastly it is ordered that if the said dish shall not be sealed or that the taker of the said scavadge corn do not observe this order that then such as shall have cause and be wronged may from time to time complain at the next sessions of peace to be held for the county of durham provided always that this decree or any thing therein contained shall not extend to such only as buy corn at newcastle and other places where toll of such corn is taken and bring the same to their own houses in durham unless that the same parties do afterward bring such their corn to the said city to be there sold again in which case only it shall be lawful for the takers of the said scavadge corn to take toll of the said corn also according to the proportion aforesaid  manns mss   given in the notes was of so recent a date as the year      after the time of granting bishop matthews charter and the decree there stated was made in the year       the charter of bishop matthew was kept in force until an order was made on the   th day of august      to the following purport then ordered by us the major aldermen and common council in the common council assembled or the majoritie of us that the charter of incorporation of this city be forthwith surrendered under the common seal into the hands of the right honorable and right reverend father

crewe who granted a new charter to the city bearing date the  th of march      but on account of some want of form in the surrender of matthews charter it was deemed illegal and ineffectual and the body corporate continued to act under the former until the year      not enforcing any of the powers contained in crewes charter and for that reason unnecessary to be set forth  it appears that in late years several innovations were practiced in the city by persons not free exercising their trades within the liberties and apprentices gaining their freedom by illicit practices of the several companies to prevent such abuses in future the body corporate at a public meeting made byelaws or ordinances dated the  th of november      whereby they imposed a fine on all intruders who should exercise their trades within the liberties of twenty shillings a week so long as they continued so to do at a meeting of the mayor aldermen and commonalty of the city of durham and borough of framwelgate held at the guild hall or tollbooth within the said city the  th day of nov      the several orders and byelaws hereinaftermentioned were then made by the said mayor aldermen and commonalty to be observed and kept by them and by the wardens stewards and freemen of the several respective companies fraternities or fellowships in or belonging to the said city or borough  whereas

commonalty to defray any public expense that may happen to the said corporation and fraternities  and it is likewise ordered by the said mayor aldermen and commonalty that every person that shall hereafter be admitted a freeman into any company within the said city and borough shall pay the sum of one shilling to the mayor of durham for the time being over and above the usual fees which shilling shall be paid into the hutch for the purposes aforesaid  and for the effectual preventing all persons being made free that have not a right or title to their freedom in the said city and for the better regulating the same the mayor one or more alderman or aldermen of the said city and the wardens and stewards of the said several and respective companies for the time being shall from henceforth meet at the guild hall or tollbooth in the said city four times in every year viz on the first monday after martinmas the first monday after candlemas the first monday after may day and the

before such his admittance to be a freeman and to be approved of by the said mayor and one or more alderman or aldermen and the wardens and stewards of the several and respective company or fraternity for the time being whereof he or they is or are to be made and admitted a freeman or freemen respectively or the majority of the said mayor alderman or aldermen and wardens of such respective company then and there present  and that any warden steward or other freeman that will make any person a freeman of the said city or of any company therein contrary to this order or byelaw shall respectively forfeit and pay the sum of thirty pounds to the mayor aldermen and commonalty of the said city of durham to be by them recovered by action or distress of the offenders goods or otherwise and to be paid into the hutch for the purposes aforesaid  and that the town clerk of the said city for the time being shall attend at such the said meetings to call every such person or persons as is or are to be admitted a freeman or freemen and enter his or their names as a freeman in a book to be kept for that purpose for which every person so admitted a freeman shall pay him sixpence as his fee for his doing thereof over and above his usual fee  and it is further ordered that if any freeman of any company whatsoever within the said city or borough of framwelgate shall take an apprentice after a clandestine manner only with intent or design to make him free of the said city and borough and does not actually teach his said apprentice the art and mystery of which he the said master is free but shall turn or assign him over or suffer him to go to some other master not freeman of the same company or to some other place out of the said city or borough or the liberties thereof to learn his trade and only serve his master at certain times he the said master shall forfeit the sum of thirty pounds to and for the use and benefit of the said mayor aldermen and commonalty for the purposes aforesaid and to be recovered as aforesaid and that any apprentice so bound and who shall not serve his apprenticeship fairly and regularly with a freeman of the same company to which he is bound as an apprentice in the city of durham or borough of framwelgate or be legally assigned over to a trading freeman of such fraternity inhabiting within the said city or suburbs not to be entitled to his freedom in the said city of durham or borough of framwelgate upon any pretense whatsoever  and in case the mayor of the said city for the time being shall swear such apprentice or any other person that has not actually served seven years as an apprentice with a freeman of one of the said companies or fraternities belonging or used in the said city or shall not be justly entitled to the same by ancient usage or custom within the said city shall forfeit and pay the sum of thirty pounds into the said hutch for the benefit and purpose aforesaid which said sum of thirty pounds shall be recovered

be called before he should be admitted under a penalty against the warden of the trade in which any breach of the rule was committed of  0l and also to prevent taking apprentices who should not manually serve seven years to his master under a penalty of  0l against the master and a like penalty of  0l against the mayor for swearing in any illegal person  notwithstanding such prudent regulations several efforts were made to evade the ordinances and in the year      an experimental freedom was created to try the legality of the byelaws or rules last mentioned which brought on a legal discussion in the result confirming them as consistent with law and the constitution of the incorporation green against mayor of durham  kings bench hilary term  0 geo ii   th jan       burrows reports vol i p      this case was set down in the crown paper as a special verdict and was so called and argued by one council on each side in the same manner as if it had been a special verdict but it was only a verdict on six several traverses to the return of a mandamus on   ann c  0 directed to the mayor of durham commanding him to swear and admit robert green into the place and office of a freeman of the company or fraternity of freemasons of the city of durham  the right set up by robert green was his having been duly elected and admitted a freeman of the company but the objection to his being sworn by the mayor was that he had not conformed to certain byelaws particularly specified in the return and found by the verdict  the return was that durham is and for time immemorial has been an ancient city etc and also that a power is given by a charter of tobias then bishop of durham in    eliz confirmed by james i to the mayor aldermen and common council for the time being or the major part of them of whom the mayor and six of the aldermen to be seven to make byelaws in the stead for and in the name of the whole corporate body of the city of durham and framwelgate  then the return set forth that certain byelaws were duly made by the mayor aldermen and commonalty in due manner met and assembled at the guild hall etc on the  th nov      and particularly specifies three several byelaws as having been then and there made by them for calling the names at four meetings and the penal laws against the wardens and the mayor etc  vide byelaws on the preceding page  all which said several ordinances and byelaws the return alleges to have ever since the making thereof been constantly observed and kept etc and to be still in their full force and virtue etc  that robert green was not elected and admitted a freeman of the said company of freemasons roughmasons wallers paviors plasterers slaters and bricklayers  that green was never duly called to be a freeman of the said city of durham and framwelgate nor ever approved of by the mayor or one or more alderman or aldermen of the city of durham and framwelgate aforesaid and the warden and stewards of the said company or fraternity of freemasons etc before his supposed election and admission to be a freeman of the said company or fraternity according to the first ordinance or byelaw abovementioned as he ought to have been  and for these reasons the said mayor has not sworn and admitted him nor administered the oaths usually taken for the due execution of the said office  upon this return green takes

stewards of the said company or fraternity of freemasons roughmasons etc to be a freeman of the said city of durham and framwelgate  this case was argued on the   th of nov      by mr ambler for the plaintiff and mr clayton for the defendant when the court ordered it to stand for judgment to the then next term and lord mansfield then delivered the resolution of the court  the general question depends upon robert greens right to the franchise which he claims  the objection to his right arises from his not being qualified according to the byelaw  if the byelaw is good and binding and he appears to be an object of it he is certainly not qualified and the mayor has returned a sufficient reason for not admitting and swearing him  all the objections which have been made therefore tend to set aside the byelaw or if the byelaw be good to show that greens case is not within it  it has been argued that the byelaw is void upon two grounds  st for want of authority to make it  dly from the subject matter  as to the first the objection is that the byelaws are returned to be made by the mayor aldermen and commonalty whereas the power is given to the mayor aldermen and twentyfour common council or the major part of them of whom the mayor and six aldermen should be seven  answer the power to the select number is to make byelaws in the stead for and in the name of the whole corporate body these byelaws might be made by the select number acting in the name of the whole incorporate body and must be so intended for the jury find that they did in due manner meet and in due manner make the byelaws  as to the second that the byelaw is unreasonable and void for it is likened to the case of the tailors of ipswich   co    a byelaw that none should work at his trade until he had presented himself to the company of tailors and proved that he had served seven years as an apprentice and admitted by them to be a sufficient workman  answ in that case the byelaw was against law it was against the  th of eliz and a further restraint than that act made  but this byelaw is not against any law it is not a restraint upon trade but seems a reasonable regulation to prevent persons being unduly made free who are not entitled by birthright service or purchase it provides a method for previously examining into the right of those who claim to be made free  objection that there is no method to compel a meeting of the mayor alderman or aldermen and the wardens and stewards of companies  answ this objection extends equally to all corporate assemblies by custom charter or byelaw but there is a known method by mandamus  object if a person has a right to be admitted a freeman yet unless he be approved of by the mayor etc he is not to be admitted and there is no method to compel them to approve  answ if the mayor etc disapprove without a cause a mandamus will lie suggesting the qualification and right of the person claiming to be a freeman and commanding the mayor to approve and admit but supposing the byelaw good it has been argued that this case is not within it   st object the mandamus is to admit green to the freedom of the company the byelaw relates only to the freedom of the city  answ it appears by the second byelaw to be the same thing   d object the byelaw prohibits indeed the election of persons not called and approved etc and subjects disobedience to a penalty but does not make the election void and cannot transfer the right of election vested in the electors to the mayor  answ these objections are sounded upon a misunderstanding of the byelaw and a misconception of the nature of the case the writ recites that green had been duly elected and admitted a freeman and therefore commands the mayor to swear him  the mayor returns the bye law etc and that before greens supposed election and admittance by the company to be a freeman he was not called and approved by the mayor etc and the fact found by the jury is that he was elected and admitted by the company but not called and approved by the mayor etc so that it appears upon this record that the intent of the byelaw was that no person should be elected and admitted a freeman of the company unless he was called at the assembly and approved etc which was a previous act to be done before the company could elect him  the way to prevent the abuse that the company unduly admitted persons to their freedom the second byelaw inflicts a penalty on the company who should make any one free without the previous calling and approbation and the third byelaw inflicts a penalty on the mayor who should swear any such person  the stating the fact answers both the objections for the byelaw makes the appearance and approbation a necessary qualification to the being made free by the company and a restraint upon them to elect any one to his freedom before his conforming to the byelaw and the right of election is not transferred to the mayor but remains where it was  object it is not returned that there was any assembly at which green might appear to be called  answ it shall be intended and if in fact there was no assembly green might have pleaded it excuse  object he might have been elected and admitted before the making this byelaw  ans the jury have found that he was elected and admitted but that he was not called and approved pursuant to the byelaw so that the byelaw was in being at the time of his election  it is to be observed that it is not stated what is the method of the companys electing freemen nor any thing in the charter concerning it for aught that appears the first byelaw may be agreeable to the ancient usage and revived by this byelaw and enforced by penalties but supposing it to be introductory of a previous qualification it seems to be reasonable and well calculated to prevent improper persons not entitled being made free it is much more reasonable than the custom of london that no broad cloth should be sold but what was brought to blackwellhall to be examined   co    yet this custom was held good because it was to prevent fraud  we are of opinion that none of the objections are well sounded and therefore that the return ought to be allowed  consequently as this was the case of traversing the return to a mandamu pursuant to the stat   ann cap  0 the rule was taken that judgment be entered for the defendant     the hydra of innovation gained strength by the loss of the above project for upon the arguments in the kings bench discovery was obtained how to overset the whole of the above prudential rule and let in a shoal of freemen who might at the election of members of parliament exercise the freedom of voting and thereby depreciate the privileges of the burgesses who had acquired their franchise under the powers of the chartered incorporation this project was played off in the year      and threw the whole city into confusion creating in the event such a division in the body that they refused to join in the exercise of the powers of their charter so that in the year      the number of members prescribed for carrying into execution the several powers of the charter was lost and the charter itself became disolved and obsolete in mr manns mss penes g allan is the following account of the transactions in      the byelaw of      was found to be a good and wholesome law and answered the end for which it was made by preventing persons being made free who had no right to their freedom and other orders and byelaws were afterward made tending to the same purpose which were constantly observed until the   th of october      some short time after the death of henry lambton esquire one of the members in parliament for the city when the mayor with some of the aldermen and common council made an order or byelaw to repeal or make void the former thereby altering the manner of admitting freemen prescribed in such former orders or byelaws  on the  d of november      at a meeting of some of the aldermen and common council at the tollbooth under this new order or byelaw the town clerk mr robt robinson attorney at law  by their order in an arbitrary and hasty manner did call over the names of several persons to the number of     or thereabouts living in different counties in order to be admitted freemen of the said city though no way entitled thereunto several wardens of different companies and freemen then and there objecting and protesting against the same but no notice was taken of such objections and protests and at the election of a member for the city in the place of mr lambton which began on the  th of december          persons so called on the  d of november were admitted to poll as freemen of the city  the candidates in this election were ralph gowland esquire of durham then major of the durham regiment of militia and major general john lambton esquire of harraton in the county of durham the poll continued six days at the conclusion the numbers stood for mr gowland including the     occasional freemen     for mr lambton     so that mr gowland was returned elected with a majority of    votes but upon a petition by mr lambton the house of commons on tuesday the   th of may      resolved that the     made or pretended to be made free had no right to vote and that general lambton was duly elected on a division of the house    against     the members of the incorporated body being thrown into distraction by this strange transaction as was observed before suffered their charter to be vacated the following petition was presented to bishop trevor for a new charter but he died before the matter was proceeded in and the petition was renewed to his successor  to the honorable and right reverend father in god richard lord bishop of durham the humble petition of all the several companies and fraternities of and within the city of durham humbly shows that by charter formerly granted by tobias matthew bishop of durham in the reign of the late queen elizabeth the commonalty of the city of durham were incorporated and were made to consist of three integral parts viz a mayor twelve aldermen and twentyfour common councilmen who by the said charter were invested with diverse powers and authorities and particularly a power was by the said charter given to the said mayor and aldermen and their successors solely of choosing and electing two such persons from each of the twelve trades therein named as they should think proper who were to be of the common council of the said city together and along with the said mayor and aldermen  and your petitioners further humbly show unto your lordship that by the death and amotion of several of the aldermen who acted under the said charter the persons now being or taking upon themselves to be aldermen of the said city are so reduced in point of number as to be disabled from doing many corporate acts in cases where a particular number of the said mayor and aldermen is by the said charter required by which means the said charter in some instances is rendered totally of no use  and your petitioners further humbly show unto your lordship that they have been informed that a petition has already been presented or is intended to be presented to your lordship for a new charter subscribed only by a small part of the body of freemen of and belonging to the said city many of whom not knowing the purport or meaning thereof were induced to sign the same but being since more rightly informed are now very desirous that the said petition should be retracted and suppressed  and your petitioners humbly submit to your lordship that the power given to the mayor and aldermen of the said city by the said old charter solely of choosing the common council is contrary to the mode of electing in such cases given by almost every other charter in the kingdom is very unreasonable has all along been attended with great inconveniences and particularly of late years the same having been productive of many mischiefs expensive lawsuits and other very disagreeable incidents and is of great detriment and oppression to the said several companies and fraternities who by such means are not represented by two such persons of their respective companies as they would respectively desire to appoint  that the said old charter directs the mayor and aldermen and their successors for the time being or the major part of them should yearly on the third day of october assign name and choose twentyfour persons of the most discreet and upright men that is to say two out of those twelve several arts meetings or faculties following to wit two out of the mercers grocers haberdashers ironmongers and salters two out of the drapers and tailors two out of the skinners and glovers two out of the tanners two out of the weavers two out of the dyers and fullers two out of the cordwainers two out of the sadlers two out of the butchers two out of the smiths two out of the carpenters and joiners and two out of the free masons and rough masons to be of the common council of the said city  that there are within the said city three other trades or mysteries viz the goldsmiths plumbers pewterers potters glaziers and painters the curriers and tallow chandlers the barbers and ropers who apprehend they have been injured in their liberties and privileges as freemen of the said city and are desirous of being represented as a part of the collective body of the said corporation equally and in the same manner with the other twelve trades abovementioned  to the intent therefore that your petitioners who are by much the greater part of the freemen residing in or near the said city and their successors freemen of all the several companies and fraternities aforesaid may be equally and properly represented by two of the most able and discreet persons out of each of the said companies or fraternities respectively your petitioners with all humble submission and deference to your lordship pray that your lordship will be pleased in the framing of such new charter to order and direct that such able and discreet persons as aforesaid may be annually elected and sent as well from each of the said three trades or mysteries last abovementioned as from the twelve trades in the said old charter named who may be of the common council of the said city together and along with the said mayor and aldermen for the time being and that the right of electing such common councilmen may be vested in the several companies from which they shall respectively be sent and which mode and right of electing the said common council your petitioners humbly hope your lordship will not only approve of but grant as being not only reasonable but also consistent with and agreeable to almost every other corporation charter in the kingdom  and your petitioners further humbly hope and pray that your lordship at the time of granting such new charter will according to your wonted and wellknown goodness be pleased to appoint such persons to be the new mayor aldermen and common councilmen as shall by a majority of the said several companies and fraternities at a general meeting of the same be recommended to your lordship as the most proper persons to fill such offices  and that such further and other wholesome and salutary laws and ordinances may in the said new charter be contained as will have a manifest tendency to and promote within the said city good rule and government and a due administration of public justice and as to your lordship shall seem meet  and your petitioners as in duty bound shall ever pray etc    under this predicament the city remained until the  d of october    0 when the present bishop of durham was graciously pleased to grant a new charter as follows  john by the grace of god bishop of durham whereas the city of durham in the county palatine of durham is and for time whereof the memory of man is not to the contrary has been an ancient city and the burgesses men and inhabitants of the said city together with the men and inhabitants of framwelgate near the said city in the county aforesaid have had and enjoyed diverse rights liberties jurisdictions franchises and privileges as well by prescription as by reason of diverse charters grants and confirmations by diverse of our predecessors bishops of durham and whereas our predecessor tobias by the grace of god formerly bishop of durham by his letters patent under the seal of the said county palatine bearing date the twentyfirst day of september in the fortyfourth year of the reign of the lady elizabeth late queen of england and in the year of our lord one thousand six hundred and two did will ordain constitute and grant for him and his successors as much as in him laid that the burgesses men and inhabitants of the said city of durham and framwelgate should be one body politic and incorporate of a mayor twelve aldermen and commonalty to endure for ever and further that the said burgesses men and inhabitants for ever should be one body politic and corporate in deed fact and name by the name of the mayor aldermen and commonalty of the city of durham and framwelgate and did for himself and his successors really and fully as much as in him lay thereby erect make ordain constitute and create them one body corporate and politic by the name of the mayor aldermen and commonalty of the city of durham and framwelgate and did decree and declare them and their successors for ever to be incorporated united and established one body corporate and politic by the name of the mayor aldermen and commonalty of the city of durham and framwelgate and did decree and declare them and their successors for ever to be incorporated united and established one body and that they should be for ever named and called the mayor aldermen and commonalty of the city of durham and framwelgate and by that name have perpetual succession and should be for all future times persons able and capable in law and that by the same name they might plead and be impleaded and under the aforesaid name might prosecute defend or answer in and for all and all manner of causes complaints actions and suits real personal and mixed of what nature or kind soever before whatsoever judges as well spiritual as temporal in all courts of him and his successors within the county palatine of durham and sadberge and as much as in him laid elsewhere in all other courts and places whatsoever and that the said mayor aldermen and commonalty of the city of durham and framwelgate and the successors of them should be able and capable in law to purchase and receive lands tenements annuities rents services advowsons patronage of churches emoluments possessions and hereditaments and also all goods and chattels whatsoever as well spiritual as temporal of any person or persons whomsoever who would give grant leave sell or assign the same unto them so that the said lands tenements hereditaments and premises by them to be taken and purchased should not exceed the yearly value of one hundred marks to hold to them and their successors according to the states and forms of the same gifts grants bequests sales and purchases without the molestation or disturbance of him or his successors or of his or their officers or ministers whatsoever saving always to the said late bishop and his successors all fines forfeitures and royal rights by or by reason of the same gifts bequests sales or purchases howsoever arising and happening to him and his successors due and of right accustomed  and that the said mayor aldermen and commonalty of the city of durham and framwelgate should have one common seal to seal all and singular writings charters and instruments any way touching or concerning them the mayor aldermen and commonalty and their successors or their lands tenements hereditaments goods chattels or public affairs  and for the better execution of the premises he did thereby assign make constitute and name hugh wright one of the burgesses and inhabitants within the aforesaid city of durham to be the first and modern mayor of the said city of durham and framwelgate and afterward to be one of the aldermen of the said city of durham and framwelgate and did also thereby assign name and constitute for him and his successors twelve other burgesses and inhabitants within the said city of durham and framwelgate in the said charter or letters patent named to be aldermen of the said city of durham and framwelgate  and did thereby also will and grant that the mayor and aldermen of the said city of durham and framwelgate and their successors for the time being for ever should yearly choose and name twentyfour other discreet men out of the twelve several arts mysteries or faculties and in the manner therein mentioned who should be resident commorant and inhabitant within the said city of durham and framwelgate and that the mayor aldermen and twentyfour other discreet men of the said city should be the common council of the said city of durham and framwelgate and by the said letters patent did give and grant powers to choose future mayors aldermen and common council together with diverse other powers liberties privileges franchises immunities and jurisdictions  and whereas it appears to us that by several disputes events and accidents no mayor aldermen or twentyfour so to be elected as aforesaid can in future be elected under or by virtue of the powers and authorities given and granted by the said letters patent or otherwise and the said corporation of the said city of durham and framwelgate is incapable of doing any corporate act and is dissolved or in great danger of being dissolved  and whereas diverse of the burgesses of the said city of durham and framwelgate as well on the behalf of themselves as all other the burgesses thereof have most humbly besought us to show and extend our grace and favor to the said city of durham and framwelgate and that it would please us to revive the said corporation and to restore to them their ancient franchises privileges and immunities by granting them a new charter of incorporation with such powers and authorities as we should think proper and with provisions to prevent as far as may be diverse inconveniences and dangers which the said corporation from the form of the said charter or letters patent of the said late bishop of durham were exposed to and we being willing to give relief in the premises as far as in us lies know ye therefore extracts from the report of james wallace esquire the bishops attorney general dated  th aug      the title of some of the aldermen was disputed upon the grounds of their not being inhabitants within durham or framwelgate at the time of their elections which is a qualification required by the charter and had been disregarded in the election of aldermen in a variety of instances at different periods informations in the nature of quo warranto were filed in the court of kings bench at westminster against the earl of darlington the hon frederick vane john tempest esquire ra bowser and john hopper who were removed from their office of aldermen either by judgment of ouster or disclaimer and the hon gilbert vane resigned his office  the election of the common council on the  d of oct      was attended with disorder and confusion and mistakes and irregularities were then committed in the choice of some of them which in their consequences affected the title of mr john lamb in the office of mayor to which he was elected the day following and on an information in the nature of quo warranto judgment was obtained against him for exercising the office of mayor under that election and from that time there has not been any legal mayor  by the means before stated and by the natural deaths of mr tho hornsby and mr jos gray the aldermen are reduced to four namely mr tho dunn residing in elvet mr tho bainbridge residing in stockton mr john drake bainbridge residing at durham mr benj whitaker residing in america and not likely to return and who before his departure signified his intention to resign his office of alderman  in this situation the powers and authorities vested in the corporation are suspended and as the charter made a greater number of aldermen than at present exist essential to the election of a mayor and aldermen i conceive it is impossible for the corporation to preserve or continue itself by the operation of the stat of   th geo i or by any other means  the expediency of a charter to revive the corporation is admitted by the petitioners and cannot be denied or doubted the members of the corporation and those entitled to the privileges and advantages of it are not the only persons interested many charities are in the disposal of the corporation the objects of which to sensibly find the benevolent designs of the founders prevented and frustrated there are besides public reasons which render a new charter immediately necessary  i conceive your lordship is possessed of jura regalia within the county palatine of durham subject to the prohibitions and restrictions contained in the stat of   th hen viii chapter    and that the sole power of granting a new charter to the city of durham and framwelgate is vested in your lordship  it appears to me that the old charter should be the basis of the new one and to be departed from in those particular provisions only which have in experience been found or probably may be inconvenient to the corporation  by the old charter the residence of an alderman within the city of durham at the time of his election is an indispensible qualification etc if the circuit of the city of durham and framwelgate shall not be sufficient for the supply of proper persons to fill the office of aldermen your lordship may in the new charter enlarge the bounds   strange      that the king by letters patent may enlarge the boundaries of a city the ceremony of granting the charter at durhamcastle  d oct    0 the members of the new corporation being assembled in the breakfast room were introduced by his lordships secretary  the several petitions were presented and the solicitor delivered the draft of the new charter approved by the bishops attorney general  the exemplification laid on a velvet cushion was signed and sealed then

and the recorder made a short oration on the duty of the citizen which was received with the like expressions of popular applause after the members of the corporation had signed the book and deposited

late of durham deceased an eminent attorney at law  mr henry smith the great benefactor of the city of durham whilst it stood incorporated by the name of aldermen and burgesses by will dated the  0th of july      gave all his coalmines then of the clear yearly value of  00l besides a personal estate in money debts and goods beyond debts and legacies worth  00l unto the city of durham in these words and as touching my colemynes and that the increase thereof may be employed for the benefit of many i freely give them all to this city of durham and the cause why i do so and further as follows is that some good trade may be devised for setting of the youth and other idle persons to work as shall be thought most convenient whereby some profit may arise to the benefit of the said city and relief of those that are past work  then he gives away several legacies and adds all the rest that remains i fully give and bequeath to this city of durham as fully and amply as i have done my colemynes and to the uses before expressed  and then appoints one alderman pro tempore edward wanles dyer and william hall draper his executors to see the said will performed and died on the   th of november      mr tho pierson was alderman at mr smiths death and together with wanles and hall entered upon his estate and continued the receipt and management thereof until tobias matthew bishop of durham in the year   0  incorporated the city by the name of mayor and aldermen and then the succeeding mayors joined with the two executors in the receipt and management thereof and so it continued until the eighth year of k james i when a commission of pious uses was awarded to william bishop of durham and several others upon which an inquest was taken and this charity found and decreed against the executors in whose hands it was and several persons were appointed to be the governors thereof particularly the then bishop richard hutton esquire his temporal chancellor h dethick h ewbanke rob cooper and several others those governors   th aug      called the executors to an account and found in their hands in ready cash    l  0s  d which they received and lodged in the chest in the town chamber which they had bought for the purpose under four locks and there also placed the bonds and other securities and writings relating to this charity and then ordered the newplace the palace of the nevill family to be bought for a trade of clothworking to be set up in which was accordingly done and   0l paid for the purchase thereof  in may      henry doughty and wm bastoe clothworkers were employed to begin the work and were settled in the newplace and one richard thomlinson had by copy of courtroll an assignment made him of some ground upon brassside moor de novo incremento and enclosed it for the benefit of the works and  00l was paid them to provide materials for which sum wm hall the executor who had recommended these three men was bound  in september      a new commission of pious uses issued to the said bishop chancellor hutton and several other commissioners who approved of what the governors had done and ordered   0l more to be advanced to the clothiers upon the statutemerchant of them and two other sureties relations of doughty and bastoe and upon surrender of tomlinsons intack and so the works went forward for about two years and then doughty and his partners broke and the governors took in one william atkinson then master of the house of correction to spin and employ children that way and gave him  0l to buy wool and also in the year      the governor employed thomas brown and george beecrofte two new clothworkers and bought them in wool and gave them it to work and employed william hall the executor to be their inspector and the work went on but slowly and to no great purpose till jan      and then was discontinued and instead thereof  0l per annum was ordered to be paid by  l per quarter to the several streets in durham and apprentices were ordered to be bound out ten or more per annum as the stock should answer  thus it has continued ever since with the addition only of two half yearly pays more to the poor of the several streets and in the year      wydop leezes and redmyers house were purchased for   0l at the yearly rent of  0l per annum  l  s  d being discounted for a copyhold rent payable thereout annually to the bishop  after this the governors put their statutemerchant in suit against doughty and bastoes relations and recovered most of the   0l last lent but all that hall the executor was bound for and more which he had got into his hands amounting to    l odd money was lost  the mayors of durham from the discontinuing of the last clothworking in the year      or  0 again received the money arising of the stock and yearly accounted for it to the governors till the year      and then a treasurer received it and so it continued during the troubles and till after the restoration to wit in december      when a commission of pious uses was awarded to bishop cousin dr sudbury then dean of durham and others and thereupon an inquest was taken whereby one john heighington who had been mayor of durham was found debtor for smiths charity    l and for charities given by others almost as much more but all that was got in satisfaction thereof was only the house and shop in the marketplace in mrs fulthorpe and alderman paxtons possession valued at   l per ann called heighingtons burgage  in the year      the receipt of the mayors of durham was discontinued and a treasurer appointed to receive and pay out the stock as the governors ordered all the collieries are now failed and have so been for many years past so that all the stock linsell bishop of hereford and prebendary of durham gave by will for the use of the poor people of the city of durham  00l to be placed out at interest or lands to be purchased therewith  f buney by his will dated  0th jan      gave to the city of

tradesmen by  l apiece for four years together  dr hartwell by will dated  th march      gave to the corporation of the city of durham  0l a year to be disposed of to two merchants or tradesmen of the established church  0l each that have served out their time in the said city and want some assistance to set up with which persons the mayor and six aldermen or more are unanimously to pitch upon without favor to any but those that stand in most need of it and that this benevolence may have its full effect as designed by me it shall be in the power of the mayor and all the residing aldermen to bestow the whole  0l on any one person whom they shall judge in their consciences to deserve it by the narrowness of his circumstances moreover the said  0l per ann is not to be paid but to the person or persons themselves chosen by the mayor and aldermen of durham according to the limitations herein named who are to certify their choice under their hands to the trustees of this part of my last

he also has the workhouses etc rentfree    00 0 0  by all this it appears that the charitable stock of the city of durham has chiefly arisen from mr smiths charity which was originally given for a manufactory but by reason of the disappointments met with by trusting the clothworkers who proved knaves with the money the governors in      devised a different disposition of the charity money as beforementioned for which end the bulk of the stock was laid out in land  such is the account given of the rise of this charitable stock  a full illustration of the foregoing history of the charitable stock will appear in the inquisitions taken by virtue of the several commissions for charitable uses mentioned hereafter  the first commission bears date the   th of march   0  directed to william lord bishop of durham and others for the due execution of a certain statute made in the high court of parliament holden the   th of october in the   d year of the reign of queen elizabeth entitled an

the several gifts of lands as the whole possessions of the church appear in the endowment after the reformation  the bishop conceiving the church built by his predecessors was not of suitable magnificence to the dignity and increasing power of the sea formed a plan for a new erection similar to the superb structures he had seen on the continent and in the year  0   he began to erect the stately edifice now the subject of our attention though the art of making glass was introduced from france in the beginning of the seventh century and eddius who wrote the life of wilfrid and lived about the year   0 asserts that he glazed the windows of the church of york when he repaired that edifice yet we have no proofs to maintain the assertion it is probable that the use of glass prevailed greatly when our prelate began this work the original form of the windows was of the circular arch similar to the galleries above the ailes and they were constructed for glazing glass windows introduced great embellishments in public edifices as the use of stucco and plaistering succeeded that improvement before which the insides of the walls were regularly chisselled and polished which circumstance has contributed greatly to the permanency of ancient buildings the inside surface being as exactly compacted as the outside the large windows introduced in this building are apparently of

almost to the fraterhouse door whereon were seated certain children in a row upon maunday thursday it being intended for that purpose the whole convent of monks had each a boy assigned him whose feet he was to wash and dry with a towel and every monk then kissed the feet he had washed and gave to each child thirty pence in money seven red herrings three loaves of bread and a wafer cake serving every child with drink themselves this godly ceremony thus ended after prayers said by the prior and convent they all departed in good decorum at the end of the bench adjoining to the fraterhouse door

highest of the fraterhouse adjoining to the deanery the roof of lead was taken down by dean whittingham and that part annexed to his own house making it a flat roof whereby he gained twenty pounds  at

collier vol i p  0   the custom of burying priors the priors of the house of durham were accustomed in ancient time to be buried in their boots and wound in their cowls by the barber as the monks used to be buried the dead prior was carried out of his lodgings in the priory to the chamber in the infirmary called the dead mans chamber there to remain a certain time at night he was carried into a chapel opposite to that chamber door called st andrews chapel and was watched all that night by the children of the almery reading davids psalms over him and two monks either of kindred or kindness were appointed to sit all night at his feet mourning for him in the morning he was carried into the chapter house where the same solemn service was performed for him which the monks had at their burial thence he was carried through the parlour into the centrygarth to be buried where every prior lay under a sine marble stone and the monks and barber buried him with a little chalice of silver other metal or wax which was laid upon his breast within the coffin and his blue bed was held over him by four monks till he was buried which the barber had for his pains for making the grave and burying him as he had for the monks  afterward the priors were buried within the church and not in the centrygarth in the same order and habit with the mire and all other furniture as their predecessors were buried before them in the centrygarth  ancient customs of the church at durham    he was buried in the chapter house between bishops walcher and william  after turgots departure for the sea of st andrews unhappy dissentions took place between the monastery and bishop flambard no prior was appointed for a considerable time and the duties of archdeacon official and vicar general were severed from the office of prior the bishop also possessed himself of several of the conventual estates as lands beyond the bridge which he built called framwelgate or durham bridge staindrop blakiston lands in wolviston and burdon and the church of siggeston  before we advance further in the history of this church it is necessary to observe that the monks translated thither were of the benedictine order they followed the rules of st benedict who was born at norsi in the dukedom of spoletto in italy about the year   0 and died about     but his rule seems not to have been confirmed till    years after his death when pope gregory the great gave a sanction to it the habit of these monks was a black loose coat or a gown of stuff reaching down to their heels with a cowl or hood of the same and a scapulary and under that a white habit as large as the former made of flannel with boots on their legs and from the color of their outward habit they were generally called black monks this rule was introduced into england in king edgars time but never perfectly observed till after the conquest of this order were all our cathedral priories except carlisle and most of the richest abbeys in england  the benedictines were obliged to perform their devotion seven times within fourandtwenty hours concord regular collected by st benedict and published with a comment by friar aenard       fullers chapter hist lib vi p      colliers ecc hist lib ii p  0   at cockcrowing or the nocturnal this service was performed at two oclock in the morning the reason for pitching upon this hour is taken partly from davids saying at midnight i will praise the lord and partly from a tradition of our saviors rising from the dead about that time matins these were said at the first hour or according to our computation at six oclock at this time the jewish morning sacrifice was offered the angels likewise were supposed to have acquainted the women with our saviors resurrection about this hour the tierce which was at nine in the morning when our savior was condemned and scourged by pilate the sexte or twelve at noon the none or three in the afternoon at this hour it is said our savior gave up the ghost besides which circumstance it was a time for public prayer in the temple at jerusalem vespers at six in the afternoon the evening sacrifice was then offered in the jewish temple and our savior is supposed to have been taken down from the cross at this hour the compline this service was performed after seven when our saviors agony in the garden it is believed begun the monks going to bed at eight had six hours to sleep before the nocturnal began if they went to bed after that service it was not as we understand reckoned a fault but after mattins they were not allowed that liberty at the tolling of the bell for prayers the monks were immediately to leave off their business and herein the canon was so strict that those who copied books or were clerks in any business and had begun a text letter were not allowed to finish it those who were employed abroad about the business of the house were presumed to be present and excused other duties and that they might not suffer by being elsewhere they were particularly recommended to the divine protection the monks were obliged to go always two together this was done to guard their conduct to prompt them to good thoughts and furnish them with a witness to defend their behavior from easter to whitsuntide the primitive church observed no fasts at other times the religious were bound to fast till three oclock on wednesdays and fridays but the twelve days in christmas were excepted in this canon every day in lent they were enjoined to fast till six in the evening during this solemnity they shortened their refreshment allowed fewer hours for sleep and spent more time in their devotions but they were not permitted to go into voluntary austerities without leave from the abbot they were not to talk in the refectory at meals but hearken to the scriptures read to them at that time the septimarians so called from their weekly offices of readers waiters cooks etc were to dine by themselves after the rest those who were absent about business had the same hours of prayer prescribed though not the same length of devotions those sent abroad and expected to return at night were forbidden to eat till they came home but this canon was sometimes dispensed with the compline was to be solemnly sung about seven at night the service concluded with this verse set a watch o lord before my mouth and keep the door of my lips after this service the monks were not allowed to talk but went to bed immediately they were all to sleep in the same dormitory but not two in a bed they lay in their clothes for small faults they were excluded the public table but for greater were debarred religious commerce and the service of the chapel and those conversing with a person under such censure were liable to the same punishment incorrigible criminals were expelled the monasteries when a brother was again received after expulsion he lost his seniority and was placed the last in the convent every monk was to have two coats and two cowls and when they had new clothes their old ones were given to the poor each had a table book a knife a needle and a handkerchief the furniture of the bed was a mat blanket rug and pillow the superior was never to dine alone so when there were no strangers he was to invite some of his brethren to his table  such were the regulations of this monastery  in the year   0  the bishop consented

the only author who mentions this is geoffrey de coldingham whartons ang sac p          who tells us that he began to erect a new work at the east end of the church for which he imported from abroad marble columns and bases but having laid the foundations and carried up the walls to some considerable height employing the most skilful artists therein the building repeatedly failed and shrunk to the imminent peril of the workmen which sufficiently indicated to him that the intended work was not acceptable to heaven and st cuthbert so that he desisted therefrom and built the gallilee at the west end of the church for the reception of women where they might have the benefit of the holy offices being otherwise debarred from the solemnities it does not appear the marble columns were placed in the gallilee it must be observed in this place that the eastern transept of the church is rather a singularity and was not built near the time of the other parts the architecture throughout the whole being different great improvements in architecture were made from the era of the foundation by bishop william to the time of bishop pudseys death the more elegant gothic order took place of the saxon and the pointed arches came in use all the windows of this part of the edifice in the lower arrangement to the east are pointed the clustered pilasters are chiefly of marble though shamefully defaced and bedaubed with a wash of lime and ochre there are no marble pilasters in any other part of the church or any of the like order of masonry although no historian tells us who finished this work yet that it was begun by bishop pudsey is certain and left by him unfinished for reasons hid in superstitious allegory probably it was completed in the time of bishop farnham and prior thomas melsonby the gallilee said to be built by bishop pudsey does not appear to be wholly a new erection it is probable he improved it and appropriated the place to the pious purpose before ascribed to it it is formed with a triple range of pillars so as to divide it into five ailes nearly of equal width the arches are circular and ornamented with zigzag mouldings the pillars are light and clustered above the arches is a dead facing or wall which goes up to the roof without any apparent utility and far from being ornamental the windows are pointed it is noted to us that a certain part of the most ancient churches had a place called the gallilee where the processions ended e catalog cod ms ecclesiae cathedr dunelm l  to    lucas glosatus  in fine libri haec nota legitur dicitur quod in

itself that they never could assent thereto it cannot be doubted but this reply would prove offensive as well to the sea of rome as the crown of england and in      we see the prior resigning his dignity though the historians of that time do not immediately express it to be in consequence of such displeasure on the   th of the calends of august the prior petitioned the convent to admit of his resignation and that they would provide a maintenance for his retirement alleging at once his want of constitutional abilities to execute the duties of his high office and also the services he had undergone in forty years monastic life fourteen of which he had been prior he asserted he had obtained a bull for his dismission but would not use its authority messengers were accordingly sent to the

camera a hall and chapel which were afterward destroyed by the scots in their incursion he built a lodge or camera at muggleswick the remains of which and also that at beaurepaire will be described in the progress of this work ibid p      in this priors time a bull was obtained from the pope for the appropriation of hoveden church for an addition of sixteen monks but at a considerable expense he procured the appointment to be converted into prebends apprehending they would prove as honorable and advantageous promotions and as acceptable to the clergy whom he wished to serve as if the original institution was maintained this prior was distinguished for his hospitality and charitable actions whenever he came to his house the poor people to whom his kitchen was ever open danced before him p im the scriptures were fulfilled in clothing the naked and feeding the hungry it is said of him that the common coinage of a denarius or penny was reduced to five mites that he might distribute handfuls of that small money to a greater number of objects when advanced in years and obliged to travel in a chariot he constantly threw money from thence to the poor he was a person of approved wisdom as well as of a magnificent mind frequent applications were made to the bishop to receive his resignation pleading his infirmities and age which in the event produced an altercation between the

privileges of an abbot and the monks profession was the right of an abbot but at length the convent agreed that the monks should first make profession to the prior and then to the prelate and receive his solemn benediction whereupon they sent messengers to the bishop that they were willing to make their profession and receive his benediction but the business was still delayed on account of some formalities which remained unsettled until the  0th of january when the bishop in the chapter house accepted the priors resignation and the manors of wardelau according to our authors words and muggleswick were assigned for his maintenance the bishop added ryton thereto these affairs being settled a conversation took place between one of the monks and the bishop in which the bishop complained with warmth that he had suffered greater indignity and disrespect than any of his predecessors but declared he would seek satisfaction in gods good time he had scarce departed the gates before his senescal with the constable of the castle and their officers entered the convent pronouncing that they came at the prelates command in his place to have custody of the house during the vacancy of the office of prior the next day the senescal calling the subprior and other officers of the household into the hall commanded the porters the marshal and other secular servants of the monastery to come forth saying the house was in the custody of the lord bishop therefore he desired to see who were proper to take care of it that he might take their oaths of fidelity remove those he did not approve and substitute others in their places he was answered such proceedings were altogether unprecedented and it was with difficulty he was persuaded to wait till  next day to give the convent time to consult the bishop thereon two of  ethren were sent without delay to the bishop with a petition for license to elect a prior on perusing which he rejected it not being addressed to him as supreme lord and patron alleging if he was not patron they were under no necessity to seek a license when the monks said the instrument was in the usual form he contradicted them asserting that after the death of prior thomas his predecessor bishop farnham for the same cause rejected the conventual petition on the return of the messengers many of the convent recollected that the cause of such precedented rejection was not as alleged by the bishop for in the instrument referred to the bishop was addressed as father and patron in spiritualties and temporalties but the seal of the convent by accident had been separated from the instrument before it came to the prelates hands which occasioned it to be renewed before he granted his license it was accordingly set forth in the arguments on this subject that as the bishop was in fact patron of the church no reason appeared why he should not be addressed as such in their process which was assented to on the succeeding day letters were issued in which he was styled reverend father and patron messengers being sent therewith they were graciously received and license for the election of a prior was immediately granted in consequence of which the bishops officers were withdrawn from the convent  in prior bertrams time a bull was obtained from the sea of rome for quieting the convent in their privileges and confirming

circumspection and attention touching the rights of the monastery and notwithstanding the great provision made for prior hugh and the expensive litigations prosecuted between the archbishop of york and his church the convent abounded in wealth during his whole administration he had assigned him for maintenance the cell of weremouth with the tithes of southwick in may      pope gregory iv held a council at lions to which the prior was called but did not attend having only his proctors there bishop stichill dying in that year the archbishop during the vacancy of the sea appointed a visitation to be held in the chapter house at durham the day before the vigil of all saints which was submitted to at that time after which ceremony the archbishop repaired to the castle where he was entertained henry de horncastre then sacrist of the cathedral church of durham bearing the crucifix before him rob de graystanes  whartons angl sac p              robert de graystanes gives an instance of the authority of the prior which shows one of the ancient customs of the monastery viz that bishop stichill whilst he was resident in the castle at durham made it his custom to send wine to the convent one day he ordered his butler to carry wine to the subpriors table which on being presented gave offense to prior hugh who presided at the upper table and thereupon he struck the table and put an end to dinner in the middle of the mess ibid p           bishop robert de insula who succeeded to the sea gave to the prior and convent the advowson of the church of meldon in his diocese accepting in exchange the sole presentation to the church of waldenestow in the diocese of lincoln to which the prior and convent had an alternate right with him he also granted them freewarren in billingham with the woods there on prior claxtons resignation  hugh of derlyngton was recalled to that dignity on the   th of january      was confirmed by the bishop on the   st of the same month and installed on the  th day of february following ibid p      he continued a short time in office under this second election his last resignation taking place on the   th of march    0 or according to graystanes      ibid  that author tells us the prior came to an agreement with the archbishop of york assenting to his exercise of jurisdiction over the churches of the diocese during a vacancy of the sea of durham as appears by an instrument in writing dated in the year      on which all preceding censures and judicial sentences touching that matter were rescinded he says the prior before his second abdication was in a superannuated state of mind yet so obstinate and resentful that when application was made for his removal on account of his incapacity he sent messengers to the bishop with a promise of large bribes to induce him to deny his suspension which did not prevail whereupon he yielded with great reluctance to a cession of his office  richard de hotoun  prior of the cell of lynche or latham was elected on the   th of march to succeed hugh of derlyngton was confirmed by the bishop on the   th of the same month and installed on the  th of april this prior was of a bold and virtuous mind and having to do with the overbearing and proud prelate bek was obliged to exert himself for the preservation of the privileges of his church a dispute soon arose between them which was fermented to a violent height as has already been related in the annals of that prelate vol i p      the excommunication suspension and interdiction of the prior being at length the consequence of their contest the bishop thereupon commanded the convent to elect a prior and they not obeying he obtruded upon them henry de luceby who then presided in the cell of holy island he was accordingly installed on prior richard being dragged from his seat by the violent hands of a monk devoted to the bishop graystanes tells us that a savage from the wilds of tyndale was brought into the church to do this act but bei struck with awe he retired from the presence of the man and declared no go could tempt him to the outrage yet what the barbarian abhorred was perptrated by one who had professed his obedience to the superior whom he assisted depose thus prior hotoun was put under confinement and luceby govern the convent in this situation affairs remained some time the prior effected h escape into cleveland where he remained until the parliament assembled at licoln when he presented a complaint against the prelate and obtained recommendatory letters from the king for relief at the court of rome the prior being master of a persuasive eloquence with much erudition and a graceful person gained the ear of the pope and a decree of restitution was pronounced in his favor which was published in the church at durham in the month of april   0 luceby had possession of the priors apartments where he retained such friends a had courage to remain with him in that situation they meanly descended to the act of spoiling the vessels belonging the house stripping off the silver ornaments and taking possession of such plate as fell under their hands with these attempting to escape and being opposed they threw the valuables over the walls and stole out by way of the hogyard luceby whilst he usurped the office retained many of the principal men of the palatinate in his family and lived in a splendid manner that thereby he might win the approbation and esteem of the people but such measures did not prevail for many treated him with high contempt he paid great attention to the sacred edifices the sacristaria was his first work he repaired the roof of the nave of the church built the vestry room and at a great expense procured bells vessels and ornaments graystanes says he conducted himself in the office of prior both at holy island and durham with such decorum that it was the opinion of many had he come duly to the latter dignity a better prior fl de graystanes  whantons angl sac p   0

hotoun returned to durham and was received most cordially by the convent who held a festival on the occasion an inquisition was afterward taken by men of the county of northumberland touching the damages sustained by the convent under the bishops persecution by the seizure of their revenues and destruction of their parks in which the bishop employed the most able advocates the kingdom afforded whilst the priors cause was managed by one only whose name was william de herle and whom graystanes perpetuates when the bishop was justly condemned in a large sum of money the pope dying soon after the bishop obtained from his successor a bull requiring the archbishop of canterbury and the bishops of lincoln and winchester to visit the chapter of durham on an accusation lodged against the prior for dilapidations and diverse offenses touching which the prelates were commanded to enquire but pope benedict departing this life the bishops purpose was frustrated till pope clement who created bk patriarch of jerusalem at his suggestion suspended the prior from all administration as well in spirituals as temporals the prior on his journey to rome for redress passed the winter near canterbury sending from thence two monks of his convent as proctors whilst he remained there the bishop committed the care of the monastery to luceby and the abbot of leicester with the popes mandatory letters accompanied him to durham to give him possession but on their arrival they sound the gates shut against them and their admittance refused on which they pronounced an excommunication against the whole society this brought on a litigation at the instance of the prior for an offense against the crown on their presuming to execute the powers of the sea of rome in matters temporal and a grievous sine was imposed upon the offenders  the prior returned from the south to meet the king at durham and on the festival of st oswald the martyr celebrated mass in the royal presence at the altar of st oswald the king granted him license to visit rome and recommendatory letters to the pope for redress with which he passed into italy but did not live to return he met with a favorable reception from the pope and college and on the   th of october obtained a sentence of restitution but was decreed to pay one thousand marks to the apostolical chamber for the same on the  th of jan graystanes says in the year   0  but from other authorities in   0  the prior departed this life and that the sea of rome might be indemnified for the loss of the fine all his goods plate books horses and effects then in italy were confiscated  prior hotoun was not deficient in public works notwithstanding the troubles in which he was embarrassed he completed the manorhouse of houghhall with the bishops license he purchased oxford place afterward called durham college and made the first erections there the account we have of this foundation is that the monks of durham might have a receptacle set their novices in the university as gloucester had lately obtained before for theirs in stockwellstreet   begin to lay their first foundation in canditch we read in a certain book entitled historia ecclesia dunelmensis et successio episcoporum that one hugo de derlyngton chosen prior of durham a d  monachos misit oxoniam ad studendum et eis satis laute expensas ministrabut this the author who was gafridus sacristan of coldingham and continued by one robertus but of the collegehall or aonplace therein he makes no mention and therefore i will not aver that he was the st so under of this college  in the next chapter viz     bib cotton vol ix p     speaking of richard de hotoun derlyngtons successor some time subprior of lytham and chosen prior of dunham a d      says the isle prior b cum oxon comparavit et aedificare fecit that is that prior speaking of richard de hton purchased  place at oxford and began there to build this was i suppose about the year    0 for i had that thereabouts the prior and convent of st frideswides register major s frideswida p     did by their charter confirm to the monks of durham for ever two plots of ground in the suburbs in magdalen parish oxon paying yearly for the same to them and their successors  s per ann the witnesses to this as i find in the original charter  being no in the register here quoted were henry owen mayo will de wodeston and andrew culbert provosts who i find were officers of this city about that time thus from the said anthony wood it is evident that this college was before richard de bury  furthermore for the greater enlargement of their enclosure mabile was  of godstow with the convent about the same time willed and granted to them diverse lands and tenements and among the r whatsoever of right they had in void ground near to periloushall in horse street part of which had stood where now kettlehall stands and belongs to trinity college the place where this cost  now spoken of stands after this or about the same time viz      follows the  of  other  l etc by which lit pat    edw i m  0 it appears that here was a college or receptacle for the  of dunham before richard de bury was bishop forty three years all which time and till bishop hald his  these monks were maintained by the prior and convent of durham out of the public treasury and were sort thither as those of gloucester priory to gloucester  to be trained up in grammar philosophy and divinity  stevens mon vol i p      ms wood  he also built the chapel de belio loco afterward called beaurepaire or bearpark the convent received a grant of freewarren in their territories at winston about this time  during this priors office the dispute which arose between ralph lord nevill of raby and the convent in the time of prior claxton was continued and did not subside for several years the account we have of it is to the following effect as given by dugdale in his baronage vol i p      about the    edw i      there was much variance between the inhabitants of the bishopric of durham and anthony beke that great prelate then bishop of durham by reason he had compelled them to go twice into scotland with horse and arms which they alleged to be contrary to right in regard they held their lands to defend the body of st cuthbert and that they ought not either for king or bishop to go beyond the rivers of tyne and tees ralph nevill then lord of raby was the chief countenancer of those who opposed the bishop not long after another dispute arose between this ralph and hugh de derlyngton then prior of durham about the offering of a stag every year upon st cuthberts day in september which in truth was rather a rent than an oblation in regard he held raby with the eight adjoining townships by the yearly rent of four pounds and a stag for contrary to the custom of his ancestors he not only required that the prior of durham at the offering of the stag ought to feast him and all the company he should bring but that the priors own menial servants should for that time be set aside and his peculiar servants and officers put in their stead whereupon amongst other of his guests he invited john de baliol of barnard castle who refused to go with him alleging that he never knew the nevills to have such a privilege there sir wm de brompton the bishops chief justice likewise acknowledging that he himself was the first who began that extravagant practice for being a young man and delighting in hunting he came with the lord nevill at the offering of the stag and said to his companions come let us go into the abbey and wind our horns and so they did the prior farther adding that before the time of this ralph none of his predecessors ever made any such claim but when they brought the stag into the hall they had only a breakfast nor did the lord himself ever stay dinner except he was invited  in the   edw iii      ralph nevill son of the former doing his fealty to william de couton then prior of durham upon lammasday for the manor of raby he told him he would offer the stag as his ancestors had done saving that whereas his father required that the priors servants should be set aside at that time and his own serve in their stead he would be content that his should attend together with those of the prior and whereas his father insisted that his servants should only be admitted at dinner he stood upon it that his should be there entertained the whole day and likewise the morrow at breakfast  whereunto the prior made answer that none of his ancestors were ever so admitted and that he would rather quit the stag than suffer any new custom to the prejudice of the church but to this ralph replied that he would perform the whole service or none and put the trial of his right upon the country the prior therefore knowing him to be so powerful and that the country durst not displease him declined the offer however at length to gain his favor in regard he had no small interest at court and might do him a kindness or a displeasure was content for that one time he should perform it as he pleased so that it might not be drawn into example afterward and for that purpose proposed that indentures should be made between them  whereupon the lord nevill brought but few with him and those more for the honor of the prior than a burden and so shortly after dinner took his leave but left one of his servants to lodge there all night and to take his breakfast there on the next day protesting that being both a son and tenant to the church he would not be burdensome to it in respect it would be no advantage to himself but might much damnify it if he should bring with him as great a train as he would saying what does a breakfast signify to me nothing and likewise that if the prior would show that he had no right to what he so claimed he would freely recede therefrom and if he had a right he would accept of a composition for it rather than be burdensome to the convent but if they should put him to get his right by law then he would not abate any thing thereof  whereupon enquiry being made amongst the oldest monks of the house they affirmed that being of eight years standing when his father was before repulsed they had often seen the stag offered and that he never staid dinner but when the prior invited him and some ancient men of the country testified as much as also that as soon as the stag was brought they carried him to the kitchen and those who brought him were taken into the hall to breakfast as they that brought their rents used to be  moreover when it happened that any of the lords nevill were desired to stay dinner with the prior his cook was admitted into the kitchen to prepare a dish for him so likewise another servant in the cellar to choose his drink and in like manner some other at the gate who knew his servants and followers merely to let them in and keep others out who under pretense of being his servants might then intrude but this was only done by the prior out of courtesy and respect and not at all of right  hereupon henry le scrope one of the justices affirmed that he had been of counsel with ralph nevill father of this ralph when he brought his writ of novell disseisin against the prior and told him that he had no right at all whereupon ralph let fall his suit  some said that making this claim out of his own see he ought there viz in the priory to show some special evidence to assert his claim others that as the prior did challenge nothing of him but what was reserved by the grant so could not he unless he showed a charter for it and besides claiming to be entertained with as many as he should bring and not specifying the number there could be no lawful reason for it because the stag was always offered on holy rood day whereupon grew an old song in rhyme as a lamentation for robert de nevill his great grandfather  well i wa sal is horns blaw holy rode this day nou es he deed and lies law was wont to blaw tham ay moreover it was further said that it never had been the custom of the prior to make a feast on that day when the servants of so great a person was to offer and that the prior usually on st cuthberts day had wont to dine with the bishop at some of his own manorhouses therefore who should compel him to make a feast at home likewise that those lands were given to the ancestors of this lord nevill when they were not such great men as to have a marshal a butler and other servants of state for in those days they had no more than raby with its appurtenances which was not then of so much worth as it is now for brancepeth and raskelfe came to them since by marriage as also other lands in yorkshire and richmondshire therefore it could not be thought that the prior of durham did give lands of such value and purchase the service to be done for them at so high a rate especially considering that in the priors land book not only all the services are exactly registered but whatsoever others ought to receive of him and lastly that there is not so much as mention made of this service in any of their chronicles  during the vacancy of the priory the bishop seized the temporalties of the convent and by stephen mauley de malolacu his vicar general displaced the subprior the priors of the cells and many who were adherents of the deceased prior appointing others in their places the prior of coldingham alone was continued in his office this graystanes exclaims against as a flagrant breach of the privileges of the convent though the bishop alleged the members of the house were not capable of holding offices by reason of the sentence of excommunication which remained unpurged in this period much perplexity arose touching presentations to vacant churches till it was determined they should be made jointly under the title of anthony bishop of durham and the convent of durham the office of prior being vacant in the year   0  on the morrow of the purification the bishop visited the chapter in the order prescribed by pope boniface when for no other irregularity or offense than their attachment to the prior in his struggles against the prelates oppressions he suspended the following members of the society for ten years  richard de aslakby who was subprior in prior hotouns time galfridus de burdon prior of finchale and nicholas de rothbury almoner of durham but

september following many of the nobility with several prelates being present at the ceremony  under the oppressive spirit of the prelate the priory suffered greatly being not only much impoverished by the expenses incurred and heavy debt contracted on account of their litigations with him but also greatly embarrassed and distressed by the defection of the prior of coldingham who renounced his obedience and subjection to the monastery the prior of durham visited that convent and displaced the prior for his offense appointing another in his room after having received the homage and fealty of the terrtenants of the shrine he followed the deposed prior to stamford whither he hastened to lay his complaint before the parliament hoping the king and his ministers would support him against his superior as he was personally known to them having carried the banner of st cuthbert in the scotch war but in this was disappointed for the countenance of the court was denied to such injurious proceedings  the prior of durham obtained permission to visit rome where he staid till the prelates death on the accession of bishop kellow the convent experienced a happy change of circumstances and received repeated marks of that prelates countenance and favor he reversed all the oppressive acts of his predecessor and restored the ancient privileges of the monastery especially in the material point that during the vacancy of the priory none save the subprior and chapter should intermeddle with the spiritualties or temporalties of the convent the bishop retaining to the sea the right of

spoken of by ancient authors in the most honorable manner graystanes remarks of him as a special singularity viros diligens habere in familia et non pueros equos pro vectura et non equulos this prompts disagreeable conjectures touching a monastic life on which an inference arises that the custom of entertaining boys had grown scandalous or otherwise the historian a monk of that church would not have marked that part of the priors character with the eulogium iste in familia erat honorificus viros diligens etc etc singularity of character even in the exercise of virtue occasions enmity for the reformation of any vice is a public reproach to those immersed in the practice of it the prior with all his good qualities was the object of much wrath he was accused with virulence at bishop

churches appertaining to the monastery lying between tyne and tees it had been usual for the archdeacon ibid to exercise archidiaconal jurisdiction in the name of the prior in the churches of the convent by virtue of an agreement made between them for which an annual sum was paid as an acknowledgment on goldesburghs refusing payment of the composition money and persisting in the exercise of jurisdiction the dispute arose by compromise it was settled that the prior should enjoy archidiaconal jurisdiction in the churches of jarrow and weremouth and goldesburgh throughout the rest for life the convent had a dispute of the like nature with the archdeacon of northumberland which was compromised in the year      on the like terms but on his death new disturbances arose and his successor claimed the like privilege  a mortality raged among the horned cattle and made a dreadful havoc during this priors time after presiding nineteen years he departed this life at pittington on the   th

copes for the ceremonies of his anniversary he instituted a chantry at the aforesaid altar which was called the chantry of the holy trinity for the celebration of divine service for ever and under the

they should be obliged to take the body from the vehicle on the outside of the churchyard and carry it on mens shoulders into the church because the chariot and horses were not the late prelates property at the time of his death he having previously disposed of them to this the prior with the assent of the convent replied that he would not consent on any consideration to the infringement of any of the privileges of his church but that the sacrist should have the chariot horses and all the vestments with which the remains should enter the north gate together with the chapel and all other the episcopal ornaments used at the interment the lord nevill and four others of distinction were chosen to determine upon this claim who adjudged that by ancient custom all these matters appertained to and were the right of the church but they compromised the same in the present instance and the executors consented to pay  00l in lieu of the articles demanded in order that the splendour of the interment might not be diminished or the intended ceremony disturbed o ineffabilis miseria hujus mundi dum vixerat erat episcopus sine comparatione ditissimus hujus regni et idem mortuus non habuit

accused him of diverse things that were merely false on purpose to bring him into trouble as that he being dean of the church took upon him to meddle in the bishops office that in his new learning he

said churches and the several deanes prebendaries and ministers of the same have no statutes or ordinances of any force or authority whereby they should be ruled and governed and therefore  as yet not fully established in such sort as the godly intent of the said late ing henry the eighth was to the great imperfection of the same churches and the hinderance of gods service and good order and

delivered up to be cancelled the remaining years therein shall be deducted from the new term if any money is received from the tenant on such demise besides seal sees all such mony and other casual profits arising from the premises which are not specially ordered by these statutes to be otherwise applied shall go to the common use of the church in support of the ordinary expenses and shall not b

as the duty requires on any negotiation of the crown business of the church attendance on parliament or the convocation involuntary imprisonment and great sickness whereby he is prevented returning to the church the like indulgencies are extended to the prebendaries by chap xiv but the modern custom of spending half their days in london etc and squandering their revenues at a distance from their

or at the most three if he is longer absent without the excuse of preaching or the causes before stipulated he shall forfeit his profits correction  these one two or three days are by this correction extended without limitation if the preacher satisfy the dean and chapter every quarter how often and where he preached so that at the end of the year it may appear whether each has performed his statutable duty  the dean may preach his sermons either on the statutable days viz easter day corpus christi and christmas day or on their octaves if there happens a greater concourse of people    a third part of the prebendaries at least shall be constantly resident or those who are absent without the causes allowed shall not have their share of quotidians and dividends for the time of such absence by a note to the ms copy before us it is observed by this it seems to be implied that those present should have all forfeitures of quotidians divided among them and this appears to be the foundation of the custom of those who are present the whole year saving statutable days of absence having the forfeitures divided amongst them if there are four prebendaries constantly here and whilst there are so many the forfeiture  to be divided amongst all in proportion to their days of being resident     chap xv  the dean and prebendaries preaching the dean and prebendaries shall be diligent

the dean and prebendaries to bishop cosins articles of inquiry in his second visitation a d       for the houses of the petty canons we certified your lordship in your first visitation that they were all in these late bad times destroyed that they were formerly but little houses or chambers made only for unmarried persons and who had their diet in common that we had already made their places better than when they had their old houses and stipends to which notwithstanding we have of our own accord and upon public cost added so much that we hope in a little time to see three good houses built for them this year and have sound out a good way for supply of a fourth and as soon as mr dury can be removed of a fifth also though with some charges to repair this the petty canonshall and the guesthall since the method of hospitality and diet were changed were of long time useless and ruined in these last destructive times but yet our design is by some reparation of walls to render the place of the petty canonshall more seemly we found no schoolhouse standing but have built a large one with addition of diverse rooms in this article it appears that the second sixth eighth and ninth prebend houses were a little before rebuilt in whole or great part  one of bishop cosins injunctions at the close of his visitation      was that no one should carry any thing through the church but that victuals or any thing of that sort should be seized and carried to the gaol to be distributed among the prisoners  it appears both by the visitation papers of bishop cousin and bishop crewe that

been spoiled of all its ornaments and much wasted and moreover that a very small stipend is assigned by the statutes to the ministers of this church to alleviate which we the dean and chapter by common and unanimous consent this  0th day of july in the year of our savior      in a general chapter held at durham have ordained and decreed that whoever after this day shall be admitted into the place of canon or prebendary of this church however becoming vacant before he be installed is to pay the precentor three shillings and fourpence the register six shillings and eightpence the two vergers four shillings for bread and wine five shillings to the bellringers one shilling the chapter of the resident prebendaries one pound to the fabric and ornaments of the church one pound and this

augmentation of residence and hospitality their corpse although in our local statutes the yearly stipend of the dean is said to be given him pro corpore decanatus sui and of the prebendaries pro corpore prebendae suae the word corpse being used herein not otherwise nor bycorps at all  our statutes were made by queen mary in the first year of her reign she being enabled thereto by an act of parliament the former statutes by king henry viii being defective as in other things so in point of law as appears by the preamble of that act we have i suppose no copy of the old statutes but by some passages in our books we may think they did not differ much from the new in the matter of corpse and some other particulars bishop tunstall having as it is probable a great hand in both and there is a traditional commendation of him for the good service he did the church concerning the statutes  but searching into the practice we find these corpse not so disposed of for a good while as they are now at the erection of the deanery although their corpse with other lands were settled upon the dean and prebendaries they came not all of them into their hands at the same time the prior and convent had leased out some as houghhall and wittongilbert for forty years and south pittington for thirtyfive years some two years before the dissolution for if it had been but one year before the leases had been void by an act of parliament and king henry viii in the interval between the dissolution and erection had made a grant of more of them to several persons for twentyone years etc  as the remaining

obtained this deanery of the queen on skynners death although the same had been promised by her majesty to dr wilson then one of her secretaries of state whittingham enjoyed the deanery sixteen years was a violent opposer of measures touching the sacerdotal vesture and used all his influence with the earl of leicester therein supporting bishop pilkingtrus arguments to the utmost of his power he wrote to the earl and as collier observes eccl hist v i p      wrought the point with more heat than his bishop and made the colors more glowing he cited several of the fathers though wide of his purpose and at length fell into vehemence and coarse language  notwithstanding all applications to the contrary the order touching sacerdotal vestments issued in      see a succinct account in colliers eccl hist v ii p      and was urged in such a manner that they that refused the same were not permitted to exercise their ministry on which the dean submitted thereto it was not long before he was severely upbraided for this compliance by one who was with him at geneva but finding an apt reply answering that he and others knew and had heard john calvin say that for external matters of

having received his orders at geneva in the english congregation there but that church refused his visitation which caused a contest between the said church and the archbishop which proceeded even to

barnards cat mss tom i pt i p         dean whittingham was guilty of much profanation on the pious monuments and sacred remains in this church the account given by wood ath oxon v i p      of those acts of violence and irreligion is shortly stated to the reader but antecedent thereto we beg leave to observe that in all ages and with all people where civilization and the true spirit of religion prevailed things applied to pious offices and religious ceremonies were held in such veneration that defiling and employing them in mean and contemptuous uses was forbidden and punished the example of balthazar in holy writ is tremendous though the superstitious rites of the jewish temple might render the vessels he abused as odious to those who stripped them from the sacred places as ever dean whittingham held the vessels of the church at durham disturbing the ashes of the dead is an offense to human nature such as the most ignorant of savages refrain from polished nations of antiquity held such remains in the highest veneration and did not conceive the most depraved mind capable of their profanation the egyptian who left his fathers corpse unredeemed was denied the privileges of society in profane history the story of cambyses affords us reflections of the like nature the learned dr prideaux is a sufficient authority to quote this instance prideauxs connection etc v i p      and his words are as he mounted his horse for the march his sword falling out of the scabbard gave him a wound on the thigh of which he died a few days after the egyptians remarking that it was in the same part of the body where he had before wounded the apis reckoned it as an especial judgment from heaven upon him for that fact and perchance they were not much out of it for it seldom happening in an affront given to any particular mode of worship how erroneous soever it may be but that religion is in general wounded thereby there are many instances in history wherein god has very signally punished the profanations of religion in the worst of times and under the worst mode of heathen idolatry wood proceeds thus the works of impiety that whittingham performed while he sat dean of durham were very many among which i shall tell you of these most of the priors of durham having been buried in coffins of stone and some in marble and each coffin covered with a plank of marble or free stone which lay level with the paving of the church for anciently men of note that were laid in such coffins were buried no deeper in the ground than the breadth of a plank to be laid over them even with the surface of the pavement he caused some of them to be plucked up and appointed them to be used as troughs for horses to drink in or hogs to feed in all the marble and free stones also that covered them and other graves he caused to be taken away and broken some of which served to make pavement in his house he also defaced all such stones as had any pictures of brass or other imagery work or chalice wrought engraven upon them and the residue he took away and employed them to his own use and did make a washing house of them at the end of the centery garth so that it could not be discerned afterward that ever any were buried in the said centery garth it was so plain and straight the truth is he could not abide any thing that appertained to a goodly religiousness or monastical life davies rites and monuments  this book was written by anon one that had belonged to the choir of durham and published by john davies of kidwelly in       within the said abbey church of durham were two holy water stones of fine marble very artificially made and engraven and bossed with hollow bosses upon the outersides of the stones very curiously wrought they were both of the same work but one much greater than the other both these were taken away by this unworthy dean and carried into his kitchen and employed to profane uses by his servants steeping their beef and salt fish in them having a conveyance in the bottoms of them to let forth the water as they had when they were in the church to let out holy water etc he also caused the image of st cuthbert which before had been removed from its proper place by dean robert horn who also had a hand in such impieties and also other ancient monuments to be defaced and broken all to pieces to the intent that there should be no memory of that holy man or of any other who had been famous in the church and great benefactors thereto as the priors his predecessors were left whole and undefaced i say it again that he did this to the end that no memory or token of that holy man st cuthbert should be left who was sent and brought thither by the power and will of almighty god and was thereupon the occasion of the erection of the monastical church of durham where the clergy and servants have all their livings and commodities from that time to this day at length after his many rambles in this world both beyond and within the seas and his too forward zeal for promoting his calvinistical if not worse opinions whereby much mischief happened to the church of england he did unwillingly being then full of worldly troubles submit himself to the stroke of death on the  0th day of june      and was buried in the cathedral church of durham soon after was a tombstone laid over his grave with an epitaph of twelve long and short verses engraven on a brass plate fastened thereto which with most if not all of the monuments which were set up after his time were miserably defaced by the scots when they invaded england in    0 so that as he had before in a woeful manner violated the monuments of his predecessors and others so was his by invaders and nothing now left to preserve his memory or person to show the place where his carcass was lodged after what wood has said of our dean it is justice to his character to gather up the sentiments of other authors oldmixons q eliz     sub anno       archbishop grindals life   0     wood

rigid doctor as whitgift in a treatise of his styles whittingham the false unworthy dean of durham for taking upon him that deanery when he was only master of arts and by the statutes of the church at durham he should have been a doctor or bachelor of divinity with such straws are these mens heads stuffed it gave also great offense that he should content himself with a geneva ordination and for this they did not forbear injuring him in saying he encouraged knox and goodman in setting up sedition in scotland for the settlement made by knox in scotland was the reformed religion and not sedition dr sandys now archbishop of york suspecting that the gentle hand of dr pilkington late bishop of durham had given the puritans too much encouragement in that diocese resolved to visit it himself dr barnes the new bishop having complained to him of the number of nonconformists whom he could not reduce to the orders of the church but whatever his pretense was for this grand visitation the real design was supposed to be against whittingham whom sandys valued not the more for having been a fellow exile with him in germany in the bloody reign of queen mary he was a divine of great learning an admirer of calvin and the church of geneva which the late honorable and reverend dr compton bishop of london styled his brethren in a letter he wrote to them and which the laudeans treat with contempt or indignation as schismatics it seems dean whittingham had only had geneva ordination which i believe as much as that the sun is now shining in a very fine day is by the bulk of the inferior clergy and younger academics at this time looked upon to be no more an ordination than that of a vestry would be there were thirtyfour other articles against him but that was like an ignorant rustics insisting to have a fellow hanged for stealing his goose when he had just been convicted of burglary the latter was sufficient to hang him and the goose afterward not worth mentioning if he was no priest as archbishop sandys urged on account of his foreign ordination that would have outed him of course and then what signified the other roll of articles but the dean instead of answering the charge stood by the rights of the church of durham and denied the archbishops power of visitation upon which the archbishop excommunicated him that is denied him the privilege and benefit of receiving the lords supper the dean appealed to the queen who directed a commission to the archbishop to the lord president of the north and to the dean of york to hear and determine the validity of his orders and to enquire into the other misdemeanors contained in the articles the lord president was a favourer of the puritans and dr hutton dean of york of whittinghams principles and boldly averred that the dean was ordained in a better sort than even the archbishop himself so that the commission came to nothing sandys vexed at the disappointment and at calling in question his right of visitation the reader sees how it goes the power the denomination the self ever uppermost obtained another commission directed to himself to the bishop of durham the lord president he must come after notwithstanding his precedence the chancellor of the diocese and some others whom he could depend upon to visit the church of durham the aim of sandys and barnes was to deprive whittingham of his deanery as a layman when the dean appeared before the commissioners he produced a certificate under the hands of eight persons for the manner of his ordination upon which the lord president rose up and said i cannot in conscience agree to deprive him for that cause only for it will be ill taken by all the godly and learned both at home and abroad that we should allow of the popish massing priests in our ministry and disallow of ministers made in a reformed church upon which the commission was adjourned sine die  one cannot help observing here how the noble and the wise abhorred persecution and how enlarged their minds were in comparison with the lordly ecclesiastics these proceedings of the archbishop against the dean were invidious and lost him his esteem both in city and county besides the calling the deans ordination in question was contrary to the statute   th elizabeth by which the ordinations of foreign reformed churches were declared valid and those that had no other orders were made of like capacities with others to enjoy any place of ministry within england it is strange the archbishop of york and the bishop of durham among other articles against the dean did not think of that mentioned by wood the oxonian who doubtless thought it of the highest importance which was that he was only graduated master of arts whereas the statutes of the church of durham required that the dean should be a bachelor of divinity chap v p   0  what trifles do they hoard up for treasures he is charged with horrid impieties by wood etc etc sure i am that all these and other the like impieties as the oxonian calls them are in no degree so impious as what himself says of that idolatrous monk cuthberts being brought to durham by the power and will of almighty god to set up a church full of idols and priests almost as stupid as the wooden images they worshipped gylls notes and mss penes g allan  the reader now has both sides of mr whittinghams character  the agreement

of our said sovereign lady elizabeth etc     in      the disturbances between the chapter and their tenants became so serious as to require the interposition of the state and thereupon the queens privy council in the north were ordered to hear the parties and make determination thereon on which occasion an adjudication was made as a perpetual ordinance to be observed between them the order set down by the right honorable the lords of the queens majestys privy counsel in the north parts between the deane and chapter of durham and their tenaunts the   th day of august   th year of queen elizabeth      where heretofore great contentions have arisen between the deane and chapter of duresme on the one party and sundry of their tennants in the country palatyne of duresme clameinge to

north parts as also at the common laws of this realm for the endinge of which troubles and for a quietness hereafter to be had and for the continuance and maintenance of the service of the inhabitants of that country due to the queens majesty her heirs and successors it is now ordered and decreed by the right honorable privy council as by certain articles hereafter ensuethe  first wherein their former suites and troubles the said tenaunts claimed to hold their sermeholdes by tenantright and that the deane and chapter alleged them to be only their tennaunts at will because some of them had taken no leases by a long time and yet it appeared by an ancient book and register of the leases made by the predecessors of the said deane and chapter showed to the said president and council in the north parts that the lands in contention belongeinge to that house had many times been letten for years by lease and also by a trial at the common law by which it should seem the said lands and tenements should not be holden by tenant right  therefore it is ordered and decreed that all the same tenaunts at will and tennants clameinge by tenant right shall relinquishe and give over for them their heirs and assigns for ever all their titles rightes and clames of tennant right in the premises and every part thereof  and forsomuche as upon debaitinge of the matter it appeared and could not be denied by the said deane and chapter but that the said tennants be bound by the custom of that countreye and the orders of the borders of england for anenst scotland to serve her majesty her heirs and successors at every time when they be commanded in warrelike manner upon the frunturs or elsewhere in scotland by the space of systene days without waiges which they shall not be able to do if they should be overcharged with great synes or raising of rents therefore and for other godlike charitable and lawful considerations it is further ordered and decreed  that every of the said tenaunts shall from henceforthe have and enjoye their several fermeholdes with chapter tennurs according to the intent of these said articles and draught of an indenture or lease hereafter set down and expressed and accordingly shall take leases of the said deane and chapter and shall pay their rents at the days and times accustomed and that every tennant shall pay do and make all other rents services and reparations and customs as the tennaunts of every such tenement or fermeholde has heretofore done paid or made for the said fermeholde or of right ought to have done paid or made  and it is further ordered that the eldest son of every tennaunt if he sue for the same within one year next after the death of his father and for defalt of such son the son and heir of the eldest son the brother of the eldest son if he be livinge or else his son and for defalt thereof the brother of the last tenant if he be then livinge or else his son sucinge for the same as before shall be admitted

the tenant fortune to have no son nor sonnes son nor brother nor brothers son as is aforesaid that then it shall be in the election of the said deane and chapter for the time being to choice their tennant and to let him the same for his lyffe in form aforesaid the true meaning of this article is that if the son brother or other be within age at the time of the death of the tennaunt then if he by his gardeyne tutor or friend make suit for the said tenement he shall be thereunto admitted tennant  notwithstanding the said former order it is ordered that if any of the said tenaunts be married

first came to this church which were laid before the council and an order made thereon dated the   th march      which shows that innovations were renewed and fresh attempts had been made against the leaseholders which government would not encourage   th march      walter belcanqual dean of durham complained of george gray and anthony smith two of the tenants of the dean and chapter of durham for misdemeanors committed by them in getting diverse of the tenants of the said dean and chapter to set their hands and seals to diverse papers and petitions of complaint against the said dean and chapter their landlord and to contribute money for prosecution of their complaints and as the said dean did allege they did not make known to the dean and chapter their grievances before they came up to complain  the said gray and smith appearing before the lords of the council did acknowledge that what was alleged against them was true as to the subscribing the petition but declared they had cause to complain against the dean and chapter for that contrary to a decree entered in the court of york and elsewhere in the time of queen elizabeth which did ascertain their right in the renewing their leases with savyor to them in respect of their tenant right and that a small fine in comparison of what the dean and chapter now required of them had wont to be paid of which they said they often complained as a grievance but never obtained hopes of relief from them  the council board after hearing the business declared themselves dissatisfied with the tenants proceedings and the archbishop of canterbury moved that the dean and chapter might do well to proceed against them in the star chamber and never to renew their leases to the tenants or the children of them who did complain and that it were fit they should be committed to prison till they did produce the schedule of grievances subscribed by the tenants to discover their names and that they should pay so much money as they received from those tenants who empowered them to prosecute this their complaint to one of the clerks of the council and that nothing should be deducted out of the same to allow the said gray and smith any thing toward the defraying of their charges or moneys laid out about the prosecution of this business for said the archbishop he was confident it was a practice against the church and did believe there was some further design in the business  hereupon the council board ordered that gray and smith be committed to the gatehouse and there to lie in prison until they produce a schedule of the names of the subscribers and that they did pay the money they had confessed to have received which was about the sum of eighty pounds unto the hands of sir william beecher one of the clerks of the council which they paid accordingly but continued in prison many weeks because they would not deliver up the list of the tenants names that subscribed the petition but a parliament meeting april    next following they were set at liberty by the council board without delivering up the list of the tenants names and the paper of subscription containing their grievances     christopher potter d d was nominated in january      rymers foed vol xx p      to this deanery but died in march following and before he was installed he was born in the barony of kendal in westmoreland was educated in queens college oxford and became a fellow thereof in      he succeeded dr barnard potter his uncle in the provostship of his college and the next year proceeded in divinity when dr laud became a favorite at court he was induced to be his follower and thereupon esteemed an arminian in the latter end of the year      then being chaplain in ordinary to the king he was made dean of worcester and in    0 executed the office of vice chancellor of oxford not without much trouble from the puritanical party in the rebellion he suffered much in the royal cause was a person greatly esteemed by all who knew him for learning and piety was exemplary in his manners and discourse of a courteous carriage a sweet and obliging temper and a comely presence ath oxon vol ii p     williss cath vol i p          greys notes mss etc     this period of time must not be passed over without observing that archbishop laud was very urgent for the establishment of decent regulations in the church service and particularly for placing the communion table at the east end of the church and enclosing it with a rail to secure it from profanation and common business but in      the commons interposing their authority in those matters the table was ordered to be removed the rails taken away the chancel levelled ornaments to be disused as basins tapers candlesticks etc and that bowing at the hallowed name toward the east should be forborne in short the hour was come when religious veneration was extinguished and slovenliness disorder and irreverence similar to the rudeness of a jewish synagogue were tolerated in the churches the charges brought against cofins which in the annals of that bishop p      were referred to this period of the work were that he set up a marble altar with cherubims in the cathedral of durham that this with the appurtenances cost two thousand pounds that this ornamental furniture which he calls appurtenances was a cope the representation of the trinity and god the father in the figure of an old man there was likewise said to be a crucifix with a red beard and blue cap the dean was likewise accused for lighting two hundred wax candles about the altar on candlemasday for forbidding the singing any psalms before or after sermons for making an anthem to be sung of the three kings of cologn gaspar balthazar and melchior and for procuring a consecrated knife only to cut the bread at the communion  the answer cofins gave in upon both was to this effect that the communion table in the church of durham was not set up by cofins but by the dean and chapter many years before he was prebendary of that church and that smart the accuser was one of that chapter that by the public accounts standing upon the register the charge did not amount to above a tenth part of what was pretended that the copes used in that church were furnished long before cofins time and that smart was prebendary when they were bought and allowed his share of the charge that cofins never approved the picture of the trinity or the image of god the father in any figure and that to his knowledge there was no such representation in the church of durham that the crucifix with a blue cap and a golden beard was nothing but the top of bishop hatfields tomb which had stood in the church above two hundred and fifty years and that there was no such figure upon any of the copes as is reported in fullers history that by the statutes of the church to which smart was sworn no less than cofins the treasurer was to provide a sufficient number of wax lights for the service of the quire during the winter season that there was never above two fair candles set upon the communion table that there was no more candles used upon candlemasnight than in the christmas holidays and that the number of them was lessened or increased in proportion to the congregation that he never forbad singing the meter psalms in the church but used to sing them himself with the people at morning prayer that he was so far from directing the singing an anthem to the three kings of cologn that at his first coming to durham cathedral he ordered this superstitious hymn to be cut out of the old song books belonging to the choristers school that no such anthem had been sung in the choir during his being there nor as far as his enquiry could reach for threescore years before and upwards that the knife used for cutting the bread at the communion was never consecrated etc etc  coll eccl his lib ix p    etc  the answer of the dean and prebendaries of durham setting forth the reasons why they could not possibly produce their book of charter acts as ordered by the right honorable the lords of the upper house of parliament sans date but probably about    april      first they supposing that the said book might be in one of the trunkes which were sent to hull at the time of the distraction upon the entringe of the scottish army did send an express messenger to hull with a letter to sir thomas glemham governor of the town entreating him to open the said trunkes before good witnesses and to search for the said chapter book as appears by their letter unto the said governor    that the said governor did find but one trunck of the churches there in which the book of their chapter acts was not to be found as appears by the letter and testimony under the hands and seals of those who opened and searched the said truncke by the govenors appointment    that the dean and prebendaries immediately after sent another express messenger to durham with letters to their chapter clerk requiring him at his peril to find out the said book whose charge properly it is or else to come up himself in person and give satisfaction to their lordships why it could not be produced as appears by their letters to the said chapter clarke    that their chapter clarke is not come up but has sent his servant who has deposed before their lordships some things wherein he may be deceived because it is certain that he is mistaken in deposing that dr duncon was present at the making up of that trunk at dr clarkes house in which the said book was supposed to be    and therefore they do suppose that that trunckeis lost either by the negligence of the said chapter clarke he being in the ship where it was and it being his proper charge to look after it or by the avarice of marrinets who finding it weighty as being full of books might suppose it was filled either with money or plate or if it were left behind in the registry where usually it remained it might be torn and destroyed by the scottish soldiers who broke open both their treasury and registrie defacinge and destroying therein many evidences and in all probability would have done so with all the rest if they had not been restrained and severely punished by their officers especially by serieant major general bailie    all these things are ready to be deposed by the dean or prebendaries which they well hope their lordships will easily believe for these two reasons    first that the loss of the truncke is most prejudicial and disadvantagious to them as having in it many of their leiger books counterpanes of seal and other evidences and chartularies which must be of invaluable loss to the church of durham and they are confident that the book of acts would have cleared them very much concerning their proceedings with mr smart    secondly to show that they have used their utmost diligence they shall produce unto your lordships all the warrants which possibly could be found in their registrie for entering their acts into the said book which warrants contain the sum of all things that have been entered into that book for almost twenty years which

commissioners returned the certificate into the register office of the court of chancery at durham dated the  st of october      stating the nature and tenure of the dean and chapters lands the certificate of the commissioners appointed to survey the manors lands and tenements of the late dean and chapter of durham by virtue of a commission grounded upon an act of the commissioners of england assembled in parliament for abolishing of dean and chapters returned into the register office of the court of chancery at durham  st october      we the commissioners of survey appointed and authorized for the survey of the several manors lands tenements and hereditaments of the late dean and chapter of the cathedral church of christ and blessed mary the virgin of durham by virtue of a commission to us granted grounded upon an act of the commissioners of england assembled in parliament for abolishing of deans and deans and chapters under the hands and seals of five or more of the trustees in the said act nominated and appointed having deliberately perused several very ancient records ledger books halmot court books court rolls and accounts belonging to the said dean and chapter and yet remaining at durham and having also heard the deposition of many witnesses produced touching the customary estates in reversion claimed by the present tenants of the said late dean and chapter thereby and by all other lawful ways and means to inform ourselves of the truth of the said claim do in all humbleness certify as follows  imprimis we do find that the several manors townships and villages of belsis billingham wolviston newton bewly bruntoft coopon bewly etc were part of the possessions of the prior and convent of durham abovesaid and very anciently belonging to the same  and we do hereby find that it manifestly appears from the year of our lord   00 that there were constantly till the dissolution of the said prior and convent which was about the   th year of king henry the  th several halmott courts holden for the said prior at several times in the year of and for the all or most of the said manors and premises at which courts the several tenants of and within the said manors townships and villages came and entered their purchases took admissions as heirs or widows respectively as the case required and the entries thereof were and are made cepit de domino etc such and such lands faciendo domino et vicinisque incumbent etc reddendo et faciendo in omnibus prout etc such an one the last tenant reddidit et facit and the like as in copyholds and customary estates is usual and as by exceeding many ancient and constant precedents and entries does and may appear  that afterward after the said prior and convent was so dissolved and their possessions reversions privileges and inheritances vested and settled by act of parliament in the said king henry the  th and his successors and conferred over amongst other lands and possessions to a dean and chapter by him newly erected and their successors by his letters patents bearing date the   th day of may in the   d year of the reign of king henry the  th  that after that all the tenants of the said prior and convent with all the said manors villages and townships becoming tenants of the said new erected dean and chapter did continue their holds and possessions in their said farmholds and land and could not be prevailed withal by the said dean and chapter to take leases for twentyone years in writing though but at the old rents howbeit much labored and endeavored by them as appeared by some few inconsiderable leases made by them to strangers of their lands in the nature of concurrent leases and of the reversions thereof which yet were constantly and are to this day enjoyed by the then present tenants or their assigns or such as do derive their interest or have descended from them the said lessees being employed as it seems to terrify the said tenants from their old way of holding into new leases who yet continued in that manner paying and performing the ancient yearly rents and services accustomed and very few leases were taken till the   th or   th year of the late queen elizabeths reign as by the receipt books and rentals plainly appears  that then many and great differences ensuing betwixt the said dean and chapter and their tenants concerning their estates customs and services and the manner of the holds which the said dean and chapter endeavored to have altered the then honorable lords of her majestys privy council and the lords president and council of the north who from her majesty was authorized to hear and determine all differences of that nature in the northern counties called before them the said parties concerned and upon full and deliberate hearing and consideration had of the several demands objections and answers of all the said parties and by and with the consent of the said dean and chapter did for the further and quiet settlement of the said estates customs holds and services make decree declare and set down their order which was entered as well in the books of orders and decrees of the said president and council and of the privy council as in the court of chancery at durham bearing date the   th of august in the   th year of the reign of the said late queen elizabeth thereby ordering amongst other things that the said tenants should hold their lands and tenements from the said dean and chapter by lease for twentyone years and so from twentyone years to twentyone years for ever paying only three years fine at the most for renewing a lease for twentyone years as aforesaid and in consideration thereof the said tenants to continue the performance of their ancient and accustomed service in the wars with horse man and furniture upon the borders and marches of england toward scotland for the space of fifteen days without wages when the said dean and chapter or their successors should require  that the then dean and chapter in approbation thereof and consenting thereto did confirm the same under their chapter seal bearing date the   th day of february in the  0th year of the reign of the late queen and in observation and pursuance of the said order in relation to the three years fine therein specified the said dean and chapter did by their chapter act or grant bearing date the   th day of april anno domini      order and appoint that the said tenants should have their leases renewed from time to time without difficulty or delay paying a years fine every  th year without any other exaction or demand which by true account is three years fine for a lease for twentyone years as by the aforesaid order is limited and appointed  and it does also appear unto us by the oaths of several persons produced and sworn thereby and by all other lawful means to inform ourselves of the truth of the claim made by the said tenants of a customary estate in reversion in their tenements and farmholds after the expiration of their present leases that the said tenants have accordingly had their leases renewed from twentyone years to twentyone years and their fines never exceeded above three years rent at improvement from time to time for twentyone years paying three years rent at the improved value clear profit ultra old rent and service as a fine for a lease for    years and to pay and perform their ancient yearly rents and services accustomed and the said tenants have always had their leases renewed from twentyone years to twentyone years and their fines never exceeded above three years rent at the improvement as aforesaid  and it also appeared by the evidence upon oath of diverse witnesses sworn and examined that the said tenants right or trust in any estate in reversion so claimed as aforesaid of and in the premises was so considerable in the general repute of the inhabitants of that county and the parts adjacent as that the said lands and tenements was usualy alienated and sold within three years value at the most of freehold and fee simple lands and that the said tenants did usualy alienate and sell their said tenant right or customary estates for five years purchase at the least and that the said dean and chapter themselves even when all the term of years in several leases of the said tenants were expired did offer five years purchase and sometimes more to such tenants for their tenant right or customary estate so claimed as aforesaid in case such tenants were not willing or able to pay the usual fine for renewing their said leases  and it does further manifestly appear unto us that the livelihood and subsistence of many hundred families in the said county do solely depend upon the said tenements and farmholds and the benefit they expect by their said claim of a customary estate and tenant right as aforesaid and that diverse of the said tenants and their ancestors have continued some hundreds of years in the possession of their tenements

deanery of durham he instantly put a stop to all leasing of farms even some where the fine had been already agreed upon between the chapter and the tenants that the revenue of the deanery might come more entire to his successor who was soon to take possession of it the chapter lands such as belong to the body in common are let here as in other churches by a lease for twentyone years on a fine payable every seven but each corpse is let as gentlemen let their estates or parsons their glebe at a rack rent without any fine and at as high a yearly value as they can    this and other acts of severity occasioned the tenants to petition the king setting forth their grievances especially a breach of those ordinances which were made in the reign of queen elizabeth see page      the petition was referred to commissioners an answer was given in by the dean and chapter in      and an interlocutory order was made in the matter but whether any final determination was had we cannot at present ascertain the proceedings of the dean and chapter of durham against their rebellious tenants before the kings commissioners      to the kings most excellent majesty the humble petition of several ancient tenants to the deane and chapter of durham on behalf of themselves and others shows that for diverse hundreds of years before the dissolution of the pryor and covent of durham your petitioners ancestors and those under whom they claim held their lands to them and their heirs under certain rents services and customs by copy of court roll as by the entries thereof in the court rolls of the said pryor and covent may appear  that the deane and chapter imediately after the dissolution endeavoring generally to break the said customs prevayled with some and constrained others to take leases whereupon in the time of queen elizabeth upon complainte made to her majesty and privy council and upon reference to and heareing of the said cause before the lord president and council in the north and upon heareing both parties in the   th year of her reign it was decreed see this in page      that the tenants and their heirs forgoeing their customary estates should have their leases renewed from twentyone years to twentyone years for ever according to a precedent thereunto annexed with certain provisoes of widows estates and other agreements in the said decree confirmed by the deane and chapter of durham the  0th of elizabeth and entered in their register and enrolled in the chauncery of durham as by an exemplification thereof under the countye palatyne seal may appear  that the said chapter consisteing of a deane and twelve prebends designeing to break this way of holding also devyded the whole deanery amongst them by lottery and for raiseing fines some prebends let leases to kinsfolks and servants over the tenants heads menaced others and by such like artifice got some to submitt to leases according to the lords order and others to accept of leases for twentyone years simply as they termed it and so to destroy the lords order but for the most part at three years old rent for a fine or little more and afterward the said chapter insisted upon three years rackerent for a fine of twentyone years and afterward demanded a seven penny that is a full years value every seven years and half a years value for a renewall every three years and a half thus by their power and greatness overswaying the tenants into what terms they pleased contrary to the true intent meaneing and judgment of the said decree  that wearied and impoverished in their livelyhoods and estates by these doeings the late powers exposing these lands to fail your petitioners as well throwgh necessity to secure them being all in lease for years then generally expireing as also to reduce their

were purchasers  but findeinge that the said deane and chapter have as little consideration of your majestys said declaration and letters as of the just desires of your petitioners  your petitioners

marsh   the answer of the deane and chapter of durham to a petition exhibited against them to his majesty by some of their tenants and by his majesty referred to the lords and other commissioners authorized for examination of the late pretended sails of crown and church lands in obedience to your lordships order of the  th of april      these respondents say that the petition which is not only against the present deane and chapter but against all their predecessors from the first foundation has not any thing in it which is not either impertinent or false as we are ready to prove in every particular  i whereas they call themselves the ancient tenants of the deane and chapter of durham the first of them is not so much as a tenant but only a purchaser of a farm belonging to the said deane and chapter which he purchased of one that had formerly purchased the said farm from the trustees of the laite usurpers but was never the tenant of that farm to the deane and chapter and as for all the rest of the petitioners who were formerly tenants to the deane and chapter and do still possess their lands there is not one of them that we know that has any lease in being or has made any application to the respondents for the renewing of his lease neither has any one of them paid any rent to the church since the late pretended dissolution of deanes and chapters and some of them being required to pay their rents answer that they have purchased their rents  ii whereas they allege that their ancestors and they under whom they hold held their lands to them and their heirs under certain rents servyces and customs by copy of court roll alledgeing for proof thereof our book of entries these respondents say that they have searched their book of entries and have not found any one tenant that ever held any of their lands to him and his heirs but only for a term of years sometimes six sometimes nine but for the most part but three with condition to be obedient to the pryor and covent and provisoe that if they dyed before that term were expired the grant to be void  iii whereas they allege that ymediately after the dissolution of the priory and covent the deane and chapter endeavoureing generally to break the said customs prevayled with some and constrained others to take leases we answer that it is true that ymediately after the dissolution of the priory and covent the deane and chapter did let almost all their lands by leases some for sixty years some for eighty and some for more but generally for but one and twenty years which way of holding being much better for the tenants then that which they had before we cannot understand what need there was of any artifices or constrainte to bring the tenants to that way of holding their lands  iv whereas they allege an order of the lord president and council of the north in the time of queen elizabeth we answer first that there is a provisoe in that order that nothing therein contained should extend to such tenants as formerly held their lands by lease but only to such as called themselves tenants by customs and were reputed by the deane and chapter to be only tenants by curtisy secondly the order of the lords concerning those tenants was made in consideration of border service which is long since ceased thirdly that the order of the lords was so little in favor of the tenants that some of them refused to take leases according to that order and others choose rather to take leases simply fourthly that all the leases for diverse years since are without any referrence to such order and as if there never had been any such order  v whereas it is alleged that the deane and chapter designeing to brake this way of holding also devyded the whole deanery among them by lottery we answer first that the deane and chapter for diverse years before the order of the lords did divyde many leases among themselves by lottery but never since that order and therefore it could not be with design to break that order secondly that if the deane and chapter devyded the whole deanery by lottery the petitioners cannot derive their succession beyond those lotteryes and therefore have not reason to complain of them nor pretense for holding from their ancestors before there was any deane and chapter as they allege in the beginning of their petition  vi whereas they allege that such tenants as were brought to accept of leases from such prebendaries as they sell unto by lot paid but three years old rent for five or little more it is false that they paid but three years rent or little more for compareing the fines with the old rents we find the fines oftentimes above tenn times so much as the old rent and sometimes above twelve time so much as for  l  s  d rent  0l fine for a farm in ayckliffe in the name of edward thompson and for   s  d rent  0l fine to richard hutchinson for a farm in burdon and for a tenement in westow  l   s  d rent   l fine which is near fourteen times the old rent which considering the proportion that was then between the rent and the true value of the lands and the great disproportion which is now by reason of the great increase of money may be thought as great fines as those which have been demanded since  vii whereas they accuse these respondents of not regarding his majestys late gracious declaration and letters and the just desires of the petitioners which are to renew their leases without fine we answer that we conceive they have made this accusation general because they are not able to instance any one particular and we desire them to name any one tenant that has made application to be who has not been offered more in consideration of his purchase and demanded less for fine then is usualy offered and demanded by any church in england in treateing with their tenants  we therefore humbly desire your lordships that the petitioners may be required to make proof of their allegations which we know they cannot and although we conceive we are not bound to disprove them we are ready to show the falsehoode of them and the truth of every thing we have affirmed that it may appear to your lordships how impudently they have abused his majesty with a complicacion of many false allegacions troubled your lordshipps and slandered their landlords by whose favors they have enjoyed their livelyhoods at so easy a rate as ought to have been acknowledged

dean of durham thus possessed of such great preferments he might have long enjoyed them with much profit and honor to himself and friends and have continued to be an ornament to his function and a general benefit to the world but some absurd notions entertained of the unlimited extent of the prerogative together with his strict adherence to the doctrines of passive obedience and nonresistance involved him in inextricable difficulties for possessed with the indispensableness of their obligation upon the prince of orange coming to rescue this nation from the dangerous attempts made upon our religion and liberties the dean opposed the measures taken for our common safety to the utmost of his power by preaching delivering charges to the clergy sending up an address to king james and subscribing a sum of money for his service and when all his endeavors proved ineffectual he was so entangled with those absurd doctrines that rather than submit to king william he chose to lose his great preferments and go into a voluntary exile and quitting durham the   th december      he arrived the   th of march following at honfleur in france in february      he took a hazardous journey to england whereby he got a small supply of money to subsist abroad his brother the earl of bath who was warm in the interest of the prince of orange endeavored for some time to secure his revenues but as no considerations whatever could induce him to swear allegiance to king william and queen mary he was at length deprived of all his preferments february      0 he not only refused himself but likewise did all in his power to deter or rather to terrify others from taking the oaths by representing the revolution as a rebellion and usurpation having no prospect after the late king jamess defeat in ireland of recovering his benefices he repaired to the abdicated monarchs court at st germain where though he had reason to expect an uncommonly kind reception yet because he was a protestant he was soon obliged to retire not only from court but also from the town it is said that upon the death of dr lamplugh he had the empty title of archbishop of york conferred upon him by king james in      he came incognito to england where he found no encouragement to make any stay having for some years enjoyed but an indifferent state of health he died at his lodgings in paris the  th of april   0  aged    and was buried at the lower end of the churchyard of the holy innocents in that city his nephew lord lansdown draws his character to great advantage in the following words  sanctity sat so easy so unaffected and so graceful upon him that in him we beheld the very beauty of holiness he was as cheerful as familiar as condescending in his conversation as he was strict regular and exemplary in his piety as wellbred and accomplished as a courtier and as reverend and as venerable as an apostle he was indeed apostolical in every thing for he abandoned all to follow his lord and master from this mans example we may learn the great danger and mischief of propagating absurd and unreasonable doctrines since there will always be found some person or other that will embrace and stiffly defend them though never so much to their own or others prejudice all not being equally endowed with the same penetrating genius or not having a yielding conscience alike see biog

offense thought it a part of christian prudence not to be more explicit on the subject till men appear more willing to submit their vain philosophy to the authority of gods word and are disposed to examine things with greater attention and impartiality concluding in the words of honest bishop tailor that he had been so pushed at by herds and flocks of people that follow any body that whistles to them or drives them to pasture that he was grown afraid of any truth that seemed chargeable with singularity in      he returned to cambridge having been chosen master of st peters college when he

several ecclesiastics who sat in this church the readers attention is required to a description of the sacred edifices with a comparative view of their ancient state and ornaments  the traveller is conducted to this cathedral by the place or placegreen where the whole north front lies open to the view the situation is singularly grand and noble the building stretching along the crown of an eminence about eighty feet perpendicular from the surface of the river which washes its base on the east side the bailey intervenes between the church and the brink of the hill and on the west this venerable pile rises on the points of rocks which show themselves on the summit of the mount and almost overhangs the stream on this elevated ground the whole edifice has the most striking and august appearance the towers to the west were anciently crowned with spires covered with lead the windows of the nave are under circular arches of the original model in the other parts excepting the upper tier of the choir most of them are of a different form and age this front is now under repair the stones being all chisseled over and the decayed parts restored the towers will receive new decorations very different from the ancient ones and the niches be supplied with new sculptures the expense is estimated at thirty thousand pounds to be paid out of the chapters treasury  a distinguished act of public munificence  as the proposed changes will effectually remove from the travellers eye the ancient appearance of this edifice it was thought expedient to present the public with a representation of the church in the state it was before the repairs began and notwithstanding the elegance of the present design it is apprehended some of the ornaments might have been chosen with greater propriety above the great window of the middle transept in two roundels were the figures of benedictine monks cut in relief by the mode of the sculpture expressive of the age of the building they led the judicious eye immediately to the era and gave an example of the state of that art these roundels are now supplied with two fine new figures  the one a prior seated in his installation chair the other an effigy of bishop pudsey cut from the figure on his episcopal seal as given in the plate of his charter to the city of durham see page     a century after this the figures will betray the spectator into an error and lead him to determine that this part of the structure was erected or at least rebuilt by that prelate on the west corner tower of the east transept were the effigies of those personages who attended the propitious cow by which the monks discovered this seat of ease and magnificence the cut shows the recess and sculptures in their decayed state the figures being now restored and finished with much art the great tower of the church as remarked in the preceding part of this work is much more modern than the rest being built as high as the gallery by prior melsanby who acceded in the year      and his successor prior middleton prior hugh of darlington who was elected in      finished the work by building the belfrey or upper tower the tabernacle work pointed arches and ornament on the outsides of the building confirm those dates for then the gothic style was in general acceptance the buttresses of the tower are graced with niches canopied and finished with tabernacle work in which are statues representing the great patrons of the sea in tolerable sculpture the height of this tower willis says is two hundred and twentythree feet describing the lanthern to be one hundred and sixtytwo feet and the belfrey sixtyone feet but mr nicholsons admeasurement which is most to be depended upon makes the whole height two hundred and fourteen feet that is the dome or lanthern one hundred and sixty and the belfrey fiftyfour feet  it appears that the placegreen before prior algars time in   0  was crowded with houses and to him we owe that great elegance of an open area between the cathedral and castle giving the two edifices at once to the spectators view he having caused the buildings to be removed and the ground to be reduced to a plain the entrance to the church was by a portico of much more modern work than the rest of the building formed by pilasters and circular arches the upper structure supported by flanking buttresses from whence sprung a pointed arch the whole terminating at a point in the center the arms of queen elizabeth in stucco work were placed on the division of two circular arches where formerly were the windows of a small chapel the portico during the late repairs was rebuilt and highly ornamented there were anciently two chambers above the north door where persons were lodged to hear the call of such as came to claim sanctuary and who rang the bell to give notice thereof after which the fugitive was secure from secular authority in ancient time before the house was suppressed the abbey church the churchyard and all the circuit thereof was a sanctuary for all manner of men that committed any great offense as killing of a man in his own defense or any prisoners who had broken out of prison and fled to the church door knocking to have it opened also certain men lay in two chambers over the north door for that purpose that when any such offenders came and knocked they instantly let them in at any hour of the night and run quickly to the galilee bell and tolled it that whosoever heard it might know that some had taken sanctuary when the prior had notice thereof he sent orders to keep

every one might see the privilege granted to st cuthberts shrine for offenders to fly unto for succor and safeguard of their lives till they could obtain their princes pardon and that they should

to present to the reader a dissertation on the ancient modes of architecture to elucidate a description of the work in the various parts of this edifice the age of it is known and the alterations made therein are almost critically ascertained what we commonly call the saxon architecture in such edifices is in fact roman for those who constructed the religious buildings which arose in the earliest era of the norman accession formed them after the models of workmen procured from the continent spoken of by richard prior of hexham l i cha   and came over to construct our capital buildings expressly according to the roman manner this style prevailed till about the conclusion of king henry the firsts reign when what we now call gothic was instroduced into britain so that in this church we find some strokes of the improved style for as the building was begun in  0   so it was many years before it was completed the walls were lest unroosed by bishop flambard at his death and the reader will recollect that bishop william brought the design with him from normandy  vol i p    the ingenious traveller mr pennant says in the inside is preserved much of the clumsy yet venerable magnificence of the early norman style the gateway which is ten feet wide is ornamented within on each hand with pilasters the inner one or that nearest the gate very richly embossed with foliage and figures in a light and elegant style the other plain the inclining arches are semicircular the inner members carved in the zigzag figure the outward one embatteled or dentelled the venerable pile strikes the visitor on his entrance with an awful solemnity not to be expressed the stately and massive columns the long extended ailes the gloom which shadows the succession of arches all contribute to affect the mind with an attention best known by being experienced ideas arise replete with the distant antiquity of the place the piety of those from whom the structure had its origin and the devotion which warmed the breasts of the religious whose characteristic virtues shone forth in the holy places the plan or design of this building is more regular than generally to be found in structures of the like age the length of the whole church within exclusive of the gallilee is four hundred and eleven feet that of the nave from the west window to the center of the columns which support the tower is two hundred feet and its width seventyfour feet of which the center aile from base to base of the pillars is twentyeight feet the superstructure is supported on two rows of columns mr pennant says the pillars are vast cylinders twentythree feet in circumference the two extreme columns to the west rise from bases of the form of a complicated cross having pointed projections from the interior angles the dimensions of each base are fifteen feet every way being exactly similar to those which support the columns of the tower and dome vulgarly called the lanthern the pillars are clustered having three semicircular pilasters in each front divided by an angular projection the next column eastward rises from a base of the form of a cross twelve feet each way supporting a clustered pillar the pilasters of which toward the center aile run up to the roof through the facia between the upper windows the next rises from a square base of eight feet and is richly fluted terminating with a plain capital which supports the gallery above the side aile each intermediate pillar is clustered like those described in the second place stretching up to the roof and those in the intervals are circular making the succession consist of a clustered pillar and a round one alternately the first round pillar is fluted as before described the second covered with the zigzag figure and the third grooved with the figure of a net the pillars opposite to each other are exactly similar in ornaments and dimensions it is also to be observed the clustered and round pillars through all the building have their bases of the dimensions before set forth all the side walls are decorated with pilasters opposite to the columns and the interior spaces under the windows are filled with double pilasters and intersecting round arches throughout the whole building except only in the east transept the arches between the great columns are all semicircular the outward members dentelled the interiors zigzagd the under gallery opens to the middle aile with one round arch divided within into two arches supported on a center pillar there is an upper gallery of single arches at the west end of the nave is a short cross aile or transcept in length ninety feet and eighteen feet wide from the centers of the columns over the ends of which rise the west towers according to willis one hundred and fiftyeight feet in height but by nicholsons admeasurement only one hundred and thirtyeight feet at the end of each side aile is a gateway which opens into the gallilee the ancient ornaments of the north aile are pointed out to the reader in the notes at the entrance of the north aile was a trellice door from pillar to pillar which opened and shut with two leaves like a folding door above it was likewise trelliced almost to the height of the vault and on the top of the said trellice were iron pikes that none should climb over it it was never opened but on holidays and at processions and the north rood on the other side of the same pillar at the north end of jesus altar was likewise never opened but to admit some procession  there were two holy water stones belonging the church of a fine blue marble the best stood within and opposite to the north church door fixed in the corner of the pillar adjoining to the lady of pitties altar on the left hand as you turn into the gallilee having a beautiful screen of wainscot finely painted with blue and little gilt stars it was kept very clean and fresh water always provided against sunday morning hallowed before divine service by one of the monks  the other stood within the south door and supplied with fresh water every sunday morning that at the south door served the prior the convent and the whole house the other being for the use of those who came that way to hear divine service  there was between two pillars on the left hand in the north aile as you go into the gallilee from the north door our lady of pitties altar enclosed on each side with wainscot with the picture of our lady supporting our savior on her knee as he was taken from the cross  and on the right hand of the said north aile at going into the gallilee under the belfrey called the gallilee steeple was st saviors altar  in the west end of the church and of the north aile over the gallilee door is a belfrey called the gallilee steeple wherein hung four great bells which were never rung but at principal feasts or when the bishop came to town  every sunday a sermon was preached in the gallilee from one to three in the afternoon previous to which at twelve the great bell of the gallilee tolled three quarters of an hour and rung the fourth quarter there were certain officers of the said house who were always charged whenever the bells were to be tolled to be in readiness to ring them but after the house was suppressed the bells were never rung in queen elizabeths reign dean whittingham intended to have them taken down and broken when thomas spark the bishops suffragan having notice of the deans purpose sent directly into yorkshire for a workman and caused three of the bells to be taken down and hung up in the new work called the lanthern where he made a set of chimes which cost him thirty or forty pounds  the lowest window toward the lanthern had three lights divided with stone work the picture of christ crucified was in the middle of the first light and in the second was the picture of our blessed lady on the other side that of st john the evangelist on one side of christ was a monk in a blue habit kneeling and holding up his hands and above were six turret windows in plain glass  the second window had two long lights divided with stone work and in white glass with colored glass about it  in the third were two long lights divided with stone work having in the first light the picture of st catherine and underneath her st oswald and below that of st cuthbert in the second light was pictured the blessed virgin with christ in her arms and underneath saint bede and below him st osmond bishop and the arms of st cuthbert and st oswald and four turret windows without pictures in

him st paul and in the second light was that of st peter and underneath him st james in fine colored glass and above four turret lights with bishop skirlaws arms on the top  within the church were two marble holy water stones bossed with hollow bosses on the outsides thereof curiously wrought that at the north door was twice as capacious as the other at the south both of the same workmanship these were taken away by dean whittingham and removed into his kitchen and employed to profane uses they stood there during his life his servants steeped their beef and salt fish in them there being a conveyance in the bottoms to let out the water as they had when in the church after that deans death the greater was removed to the lower end of the deans buttery where the water conduit is and next unto the wine cellar for the servants to wash their pots and cups in before they served them at table the base of the great holy water stone was laid without the north church door and afterward placed in the earth in the shop of one lamb a blacksmith upon framwellgate bridge  con from davies sir john lawsons mss and mr hoggs roll    there are six large windows to give light to this aile but all the old painted glass is destroyed the vaultings of the side ailes are semicircular and crossed with groined arches in plain rolls intersecting each other in the center the middle aile of the nave is sixtynine and a half feet in height the roof was vaulted with stone about the year      by prior melsonby the ribs intersect each other in pointed arches ornamented with zigzag workin the fillets there are seven upper windows to the north and six to the south at the east end of the nave between the pillars which support the great tower anciently stood jesuss altar with all its decorations no traces of which remain in the body of the church between two of the highest pillars supporting the west side of the lanthern opposite to the choir door was jesus altar where mass was sung every friday in the year and on the backside was a high stone wall at each end whereof was a door and called the two rood doors for the procession to go forth and return at each end of the altar was closed up with fine wainscot like to a porch adjoining to each rood door finely varnished with red varnish in the wainscot at the south end of the altar were four grand almeries to preserve the chalices and silver crewets with two or three suits of vestments and other ornaments belonging to the said altar for holy and principal days and at the north end of the altar in the wainscot was a door to come into the said porch there was also standing on the altar a most curious fine table with two leaves to open and shut comprehending the passion of our lord richly set in fine lively colors all like burnished gold which table was always locked up but on principal days also the forepart of the said porch was a door with two broad leaves to open from side to side all of fine throughcarved work on the principal days when any of the monks said mass at the said altar the table was opened and the door which composed the forepart of the said porch that every man might come in and see the table  there was also in the height of the wall from pillar to pillar the whole story and passion of our lord wrought in stone and curiously gilt and above was the whole story and pictures of the twelve apostles very artifically set forth and finely gilt extending from one pillar to the other and on the top above all a border artificially wrought in stone with fine colors and gilt with branches and flowers and likewise above the top of all upon the wall stood the most famous rood that was in all the land with the picture of mary on one side of our savior and that of st john on the other with two archangels  also on the back of the said rood before the choir door there was a loft and the clock stood in the south end thereof  every friday after evening prayer an anthem was sung in the body of the church before st johns altar called jesus anthem which was performed by the master and choir who sung another anthem sitting on their knees before jesus altar one of the gallilee bells tolling

from the marble cross with his epitaph  davies etc    in the center of the four west pillars is the font an elegant marble basin over which is a fine piece of tabernacle work in red oak of an octagon form richly ornamented and of excellent workmanship supported by four columns about eight feet in height the whole being about thirty feet high terminating in a pinnacle and decorated with a dove extending her wings to the east of the font between pillar and pillar is a cross of black marble laid in the pavement beyond which women were strictly prohibited advancing toward st cuthberts shrine there is betwixt the pillar on the north side wherein the holy water stone stood and the opposite pillar on the south side a row of blue marble in the midst whereof is a cross of the same colored marble in token that all women who came to hear divine service should not be suffered to come above the said cross and if it happened that any woman came above it she was instantly punished for certain days because no woman presumed to come where the holy man st cuthbert was for the reverence they had to his sacred body  also if any woman happened to come within the abbey gates or within the precincts of the house she was punished as an example to deter others from doing the like  the reasons why women ought not to come to st cuthberts seretory nor enter the precincts of the monastry  diverse books of the life and miracles of st cuthbert have been written which set forth that st cuthbert for a long time led a most recluse life in the borders of the picts in which time it happened that the daughter of the king of that province was got with child by some young man in her fathers house the king perceiving her pregnancy diligently examined her who was the cause of that fact whereupon she made this answer that solitary young man who dwells hard by is he who has overcome me and by whose beauty i am thus deceived whereupon the king repaired to the hermits place with his deflowered daughter attended by diverse knights where he instantly accosted the servant of god in this manner what art thou he who under the color of religion prophanest the temple and sanctuary of god art thou he who under the cloak and profession of an hermit exercisest thyself in all filthiness behold my daughter whom thou by thy wile have corrupted not fearing to destower her therefore now at last confess this thy fault and plainly declare here before this company in what sort thou have seduced her the kings daughter marking the fierce speeches of her father very impudently stepped forth and boldly affirmed that it was he who had done that wicked fact at which the young man greatly amazed perceiving that this calumny proceeded from the instigation of the devil applied his whole heart unto almighty god saying my lord my god who only know and art the discoverer of all secrets make manifest also this work of iniquity and by some token disprove the same which though it cannot be done by human policy make it known by some divine token when the young man had spoken these words suddenly and in the same place where the stood the earth making a hissing noise presently opened and swallowed her up in the presence of all the spectators this place is called corwen where she for her corruption was conveyed down into hell as soon as the king perceived this miracle he began to be greatly tormented in his mind fearing le for his furious threats he should m the same punishment whereupon he with his company humbly craving pardon of almighty god with a further petition to that good man st cuthbert that by his prayers he would crave of god to have his daughter again which petition the holy father granted upon condition that from thence no woman should come near him whence it came to pass that the king did not suffer any woman to enter into any church dedicated to that saint davies etc  mandatum ad vocand certas mulieres de novo castro ad peenas eis injunctas pro quod

holythursday with st bedes shrine st cuthberts banner and all the holy relics as the image of st oswald and the image of st aidanus and st margarets cross and diverse others  on trinitysunday was another general procession as aforesaid with all the above recited relics going the same circuit    the stalls are elegant the bishops stall being on the right hand side of the entrance the deans on the other one for the temporal chancellor on the deans left hand and those of the prebendaries and archdeacons in succession the minor canons next one at the extremity toward the east on the south side for the vicar general of the diocese and others on both sides for the reception of the judges of assize sheriff mayor and corporation of the city etc on such accustomed days as they attend divine service there the whole finished in a magnificent style with tabernacle work beneath the stalls are seats for the laysingers choristers almshousemen and scholars of the foundation advancing toward the altar where the stalls terminate the pavement is elevated one step and on the right hand is the bishops throne erected by bishop hatfield over the vault prepared for his own monument and built in a style consistent with the proud idea he held of the dignity of his mitre mr pennant speaking of it says in the choir is the bishops throne elevated to an uncommon height erected in times of the triumph of superstition a painful ascent to the present prelate whose wish is directed more to distinguish himself by benevolence and sincerity than any exterior trappings or badges of dignity the ascent to the throne is by many steps in the center is a chair of state richly ornamented and canopied over head with tabernacle work colored and gilt on each side the throne is lined with tapestry and otherwise handsomely furnished large enough to receive the chief temporal officers with the servants who are about the prelates person the bishop when he goes to his throne is always preceded by a person bearing a massy gilded mace in distinction of his secular power chamber tells us novum ad australem partem chorijuxta stallos monachorum curiosum opus construxit in medio cujus stallum episcopale imaginibus subtiliter sculptis sumptibus copiosis in operarios largissime impensis honorifice circumseptum fecit and decenter ordinavit the throne was repaired by lord crewe and in      was new painted and gilt by bishop egerton  the images are all removed below the throne are stalls for the prebendaries ladies on the opposite side of the choir where bishop skirlaws tomb was are other stalls for the ladies of the bishops and deans families and others and close adjoining is the pulpit finely ornamented with inlaid figures in the italian style representing some of the apostles the ground swedish oak the figures are almost as large as life so artfully shadowed as to appear like a delicate painting in bronze the sounding board is supported by one column the opening into the side ailes to which you descend by five marble steps is by a gate and two side lights of open tracery work in wood finely executed and finished above with tabernacle work the choir comprehends four pillars on each side two of them clustered and two round the round ones cut in the spiral figure the double gallery above the side ailes is formed of circular arches each of the lower openings divided by a single column the roof was repaired or rather new vaulted by prior hotoun who acceded in      it is of elegant gothic work the ribs of the arches terminating in points ornamented with roses the fillets pierced in roses and crosses some of the decorations of the center roses are singular one next to the organ contains a human figure with three round balls in an apron not unusual among the heathen emblematical effigies from the altar rails eastward the whole work appears nearly of the same date and by the architecture of this part of the edifice we are led to conclude that the building originally terminated here and was opened further eastward to form a connection with the east transept the columns which rise at the altar rail are little more than the plain facing of a common wall ornamented with long small round pilasters single and belted in the middle their capitals pierced decorated with figures of animals and finished above with tabernacle work the whole appearing like ornaments placed occasionally there the opening of the gallery in this part is different from the rest of the church consisting of three pointed arches supported by columns whose capitals are richly pierced and the fillets of the arches are pierced and highly decorated there is also an interior pillar supporting a groined vaulting here the building appears to have been broken off and the east wall removed the vaulting of the roof is continued and over the altar table finishes with a fine pointed arch supported on clustered pillars ranging with the side of the east transept the capitals and the fillets or mouldings of the arch are highly finished with pierced work and bear no degree of similitude to any of the more western parts of this edifice within the altar rails eastward from the plain columns before described are four seats on each side of the altar table for the officiating priests to rest formed of pillars supporting pinnacle work of the same materials and design as the work behind the altar and most probably erected at the same time these seats are closed from the ailes behind with a wall which proves the occasionality by being dissimilar to the rest of the aile the chancel and altar piece are of stone beautifully cut into open work a cut of it in smiths edition of bid  mr ebdon an architect brother to the present organist published two excellent views of the choir of this church  into this sumptuous new church was the last and great translation of st cuthbert but before the day came prior turgot with some of his brethren determined to open his tomb with intent to show his body to the people if they found it entire at night therefore they met at his sepulcher and reverently taking off the stone they found a chest well fortified with nails and leather and in it another wrapped in cloth thrice double in which they found the book of the evangelists which had fallen into the sea a little silver altar a goblet of pure gold with an onyx stone and an ivory comb lastly opening the third chest they found the body of the saint which the grave in so many years had not digested lying upon the right side to give room to the rest of the relics for in the same coffyn were the bones of venerable beda the head of st oswald part of the bones of aidanus eadfrid and ethelwold bishops of lindisfarne all which relics they placed with due reverence in other parts of the church and laying st cuthbert on his back they placed st oswalds head between his bands at the day of his translation ranulphus the bishop published in his sermon to the people the incorruption of st cuthberts body which after four years was flexible and now might plead prescription with the grave to be immortale and thus in great solemnity they inshrined him beneath the high altar in the presence of the abbot of st albans the abbot of st marys in york the abbot of st germans prior turgot with thousands of people spectators of the miracle hegges legend p     in      william bishop of dumblain granted an indulgence whereby every one who visited this saints shrine were to be excused forty days of their penance the original record is still in the chapter library and a copy of it is published in the appendix to dr smiths edition of beda no       and on each side are two stalls in stone originally designed for the resting places of sick votaries pennant      many travelers have been equally deceived care was taken to scrape the work which proved that the whole is a composition like what is now called plaster of paris and by davies it is called french pierre or lardoise chamber calls it lavadose    the altar screen which is very beautiful is thus spoken of by chamber the marble tomb for st cuthberts feretory being finished at the like instance of the prior and monks lord john nevil gave to the church the work above the altar called lavadose which cost him six hundred marks and was enclosed in cases and sent from london by shipping whartons ang sac      this screen is in pinnacle work of plaster of paris with pedestals for statues richly canopied was put up at the expense of the convent and finished by prior john berrington of walworth in the year    0 when the high altar was dedicated with much solemnity there lay on the high altar a book richly covered with gold and silver containing the names of all the benefactors to st cuthberts church from the first foundation thereof the letters of the book being for the most part gilt the same is yet extant  there is also another book yet extant containing the relics jewels ornaments and vestments that were given to the church by those founders whose names were on record in the book that lay upon the high altar  davies etc  this book is still preserved in the cottonian collection domitian vii   it anciently had a very rich cover which is lost it being now bound in red leather with the arms of the cottons in gold on the first leaf of vellum is written a distich in the saxon character expressing that there was enclosed under the silver cover a register of benefactors etc  st cuthberts book of the gospels with the saxon version is also preserved in this collection strutt in his chronicle engraved a page of that elegant work vol i      in a curious ms in the heraldsoffice are beautifully drawn all the arms in this church comprising one hundred and seventeen coats together with bishop hatfields monument of which mr allan has a trick from the late ra bigland esquire garter dugdales ms notat       the book of the evangelists here mentioned was originally written by edfrid then a monk and afterward bishop of lindisfarne who during his retirement in that monastery translated the gospels into latin after his decease it was decorated with gold and jewels by his successor ethelwold and curiously painted by bilfrid an anchorite prefixed to it are the prefaces and canons of eusebius and hieronymus besides an interneary saxon version by aldred the priest at the end of st

then follows a saxon writing signifying it to be the work of the aforementioned edfrid ethelwold and bilfrid and also of aldred the priest author of the saxon version  this truly venerable piece of antiquity after the reformation fell into the hands of sir robert cotton and is yet preserved in the cottonian collection in the british museum     by a door at each end of the table you enter into st cuthberts feretory thus spoken of by mr pennant behind the altar stood the shrine of st cuthbert once the richest in great britain the marks of pilgrims feet in the worn floor still evince the multitude of votaries at the dissolution his body was taken out of the tomb and interred beneath it is now stripped of every ornament is thirtyseven feet in length and twentysix in width eastward from the altar screen raised with stone work about eight feet high and surrounded with wainscot in which no great elegance appears it is formed with apertures divided by columns and ornamented with an entablature the pillars are finished with light pinnacles of tabernacle work in ancient times it is presumed the wainscot was covered within with rich hangings the marble monument which john lord nevil gave to enclose st cuthberts remains is no more a large blue stone is placed in the floor where his bones rest and it is presumed have long testified their corruptibility st cuthberts eretory next to the nine altars was the monument of st cuthbert having the high altar on the west in the midst whereof his shrine was exalted with most curious workmanship of fine green marble gilt with gold having four seats or places underneath the shrine for pilgrims or lame men sitting on their knees to rest on in the time of their devout offerings it was esteemed one of the most sumptuous monuments in all england so great were the offerings and jewels bestowed upon it  at the west end of this shrine was a little altar for mass to be said on only upon the great and holy feast of st cuthberts day in lent at which solemnity the prior and the whole convent did keep open household in the fraterhouse and dined all together and on no day else in the year and at this feast and certain other festival days they were accustomed to draw up the cover of st cuthberts shrine being of wainscot having six very fine sounding silver bells fastened to the rope which at the drawing up of the cover made a goodly sound which said cover on the outside was very finely and artificially gilded and on either side were painted four lively images on the east end the picture of our savior sitting on the rainbow to give judgment on the west end was the picture of our lady and christ on her knee and on the height of the cover from end to end was a fine brattishing of carved work cut throughout with dragons fowls and beasts and the inside of the cover was all varnished and colored with a fine sanguine color and at every corner of the cover there was a lock to lock it down  also within the said feretory both on the north side and the south there were almeries of wainscot varnished finely painted and gilt over with little images for the relics of st cuthbert to lie in and within the almeries did lie all the holy relics that were offered to st cuthbert and when his shrine was drawn the almeries were opened that every man might see the holy relics therein accounted the most sumptuous and richest jewels in all this land for great were the gifts and godly devotion of kings queens and other estates at that time toward god and holy st cuthbert in this church  within this feretory were many little pictures of saints of imagery work all of alabaster set in the french pierre in their several places the pictures being curiously engraved and gilt and the nevils cross and bulls head set upon the height and on either side of the two doors in the french pierre and also in diverse other places of the french pierre besides which feretory and french pierre were made at the charges of john lord nevil  at the east end of st cuthberts feretory were wrought upon the height of the irons toward the nine altars very fine candlesticks of iron like unto sockets which had lights set in them before day that every monk might have light to see to read their books at the said nine altars when they said mass and also to give light to all others that came thither to divine service  the king of scots ancient and his banner with diverse other noblemens ancients were all brought to st cuthberts feretory and there the said lord nevil offered the jewels and banners and there the said banners and ancients stood and hung till the suppression of the house the lord nevils banner staff was all wrythen about with iron from the midst upward and stood on the north end of the feretory and the king of scots banner hung over the midst of the alley of the nine altars under st catharines window in the east end of the church and a little after the suppression of the house they were all taken down spoiled and defaced that the memory thereof should be clean taken away being both a great honor to the realm and a decent ornament unto the church  st cuthberts shrine defaced the shrine of st cuthbert was defaced at the visitation held at durham for demolishing such monuments by dr lee dr henley and mr blithman in king henry the eighths reign at his suppression of religious houses they found many goodly and valuable jewels especially one precious stone which was of value sufficient to redeem a prince after the spoil of ornaments and jewels they approached near to his body expecting nothing but dust and ashes but perceiving the chest he lay in strongly bound with iron the goldsmith with a smiths great forehammer broke it open when they found him lying whole incorrupt with his face bare and his beard as of a fortnights growth and all the vestments about him as he was accustomed to say mass and his metwand of gold lying by him when the goldsmith perceived he had broken one of his legs in breaking open the chest he was sore troubled at it and cried alas i have broken one of his legs which dr henley hearing called to him and bade him cast down his bones the other answered he could not get them asunder for the sinews and the skin held them so that they would not separate then dr lee stepped up to see if it were so and turning about spoke in latin to dr henley that he was entire though dr henley not believing his words called again to have his bones cast down dr lee answered if you will not believe me come up yourself and see him then dr henley stepped up to him and handled him and found he lay whole then he commanded them to take him down and so it happened contrary to their expectation that not only his body was whole and uncorrupted but the vestments wherein his body lay and wherein he was accustomed to say mass were fresh safe and not consumed whereupon the visitors commanded him to be carried into the revestry till the kings pleasure concerning him was further known and upon the receipt thereof the prior and monks buried him in the ground under the place where his shrine was exalted davies etc  in      henry iii being in these parts visited st cuthbert as they call it and while he was at his devocions a courtyer whyspered in his care that dyvers bishops of his had hydden much treasure in st cuthbertes tomb the king made short and openinge the tomb sound it to be even foe whereupon he devised to borowe the same least they should charge him with profanation of the holy relics but paris compleneth that they wear never half paid again lambards topographical and historical dictionary page     in this new church was erected a sumptuous shrine called the feretory about three yards from the ground behind the high altar at the east end of the choir where his body was solemnly placed in an iron chest within the said shrine where it lay quietly without molestation till the suppression of the church and the book of the four evangelists which fell into the sea and was so miraculously landed and found again was laid on the high altar as a fit monument to preserve the memory of so great a saint  these holy bishops and monks for the honor of their holy saint aldwinus and ranulph flamberd as bishop william carileph intended at building the new church on the outside of the north west turret of the same altars erected the monument of a milkmaid milking her cow in grateful commemoration of that maid who so fortunately in their great perplexity directed them to dunholme where the body of their great saint was to rest until the resurrection which monument though defaced by the weather is visible at this time  dr william watson alias william wylome master and keeper of the feretory and viceprior at the dissolution the master of the feretorys chamber was in the dormitory his office was when any man of honor or re was disposed to offer prayers to god and st cuthbert or to offer any thing at his shrine if they requested to have it drawn or to see it the clerk of the feretory called george bates gave notice to his master the viceprior keeper of the feretory who brought the keys of the shrine and gave them to the clerk to open it his office then was to stand by and see it drawn up it was always drawn up in mattins time when te deum was singing or in high mass time or at evensong time when magnificat was sung george bates was register of the house  there was in the keeping of the viceprior a banner belonging to the shrine called st cuthberts banner the staff five yards in length all the pipes of it were of silver to be slidden on along the banner staff and on the uppermost pipe on the top of it was a little silver cross and a goodly banner cloth pertaining to it and in the midst of the banner cloth was a white velvet half a yard square and a cross of crimson velvet over it and within the said white velvet was that holy relic the corporax cloth wherewith the holy man st cuthbert covered the chalice when he said mass and the rest of the banner cloth was of crimson velvet embroidered with gold and green silk most sumptuously the said banner was at the winning of brankenfield battle in king henry the eighths time and brought home with it the king of scots banner and many noblemens ancients of scotland which were set up in st cuthberts feretory where they remained till the suppression of the house at which time st cuthberts banner and these ancients of scotland were defaced st cuthberts banner was thought to be one of the most magnificent relics of any in england and was not carried out but on principal days in general processions as easter day ascension day whitsunday corpus christi day and st cuthberts day and some other festival days it was very massy and set up at the east end of the shrine whenever it was carried in procession it was the clerks office to attend it with his surplice on with a fine red painted staff having a fork or cleft at the upper end thereof which cleft was lined with soft silk having down under the silk to prevent hurting or bruising the pipes of the banner which were of silver or in taking it down and raising it up again by reason of its great weight there were always four men to go along with it besides the clerk and the man who carried it  there was also a strong girdle of white leather that he who bore st cuthberts banner did wear whenever it was carried abroad the banner was made fast to it with two pieces of white leather and at each end of the two pieces a socket of horn was fastened to put the end of the banner staff into davies etc  the ironbound chest which tradition says contained the saints body long lay neglected in the bishops palace it is accurately represented in the plate  the chest in which st cuthberts body was deposited depiction of chest    in the choir bishop beaumont and bishop pilkington were interred  the ailes of the choir are vaulted like the ailes of the nave in the north aile opposite to bishop skirlaws tomb is a stone seat with the shields of his arms there st blases altar stood what is said in the ancient descriptions of this church touching a porch called the anchorage of which no remains is to be traced or of the stairs described to adjoin to the north door of st cuthberts feretory confirms our judgment that the whole east end of this edifice was altered in the thirteenth century and

very great benefactor to it by repairing the roof of the body of the church etc he gave also bells vestments and many other ornaments anglia sacra  in this vestry are preserved five very rich copes

away the monumental inscriptions when the new pavement was laid a mistaken zeal in all reformations has pressed the parties headlong into an extreme in many points as reprehensible as that which they tried to escape for a vehement desire of eradicating superstition urged sacrilegious hands against the monuments of those whose memories were dear to the learned whose examples and virtues were worthy the emulation of succeeding ages and with a contempt that was at once irreligious and brutal reformists rushed forward to deface memorials which they had not merit to purchase to sweep away from the eye the mementos of monks priors and prelates of the condemned church the tombstones were torn up lest they should reproach the living with remembrance of the excellencies of the dead a new pavement

extreme east end stood nine altars dedicated to as many saints above each is a most elegant window extremely narrow lofty and sharply arched above these is a round window very large and finely radiated with stone work called st catharines wheel from the form of the wheel used at her martyrdom in this part of the church is another fine window divided into circular portions all the windows in this isle terminate sharply and were the work of a later age than that of the body of the church probably the time of prior fossour page      it is to be observed that the fine paintings in these windows are almost totally defaced or so mutilated and confused by bunglers who have repaired them that the histories are not now to be made out except the story of st catherine    the descent into which is by several steps it is one hundred and thirty feet in length and in width from the screen of the high altar fiftyone feet making the whole length of the church four hundred and eleven feet st cuthberts feretory projects twentyseven feet into the transept and is elevated about eight feet above the pavement this transept is lighted by one large window at each end under pointed arches with much tracery in the glass of one of which was depicted the history of st cuthbert and in the other the history of joseph both now totally defaced to the east it is lighted by a double range of windows the lower tier consisting of nine long windows in the center of the upper tier is a large circular window called st catherines window having three long windows on each side the arches of which are all pointed by the engraving given from mr nicholsons drawing and admeasurement of the whole east end of the church the reader will distinguish the similarity of style in this transept and the tower and we hope will be convinced that the observation as to their date is not ill grounded on the projections of this front are two effigies in the printed descriptions of the church said to represent bishop william on the south who began the present edifice and on the north bishop flambard who translated st cuthberts body to the shrine prepared for him therein the first attired in his mitre and episcopal insignia the other having his head uncovered but it is more probable they are the effigies of bishop farnham ob       and his contemporary prior thomas of melsonby for bishop anthony beke who died in    0 was interred near the altar of st michael and the wall was broken through to admit his remains which is a proof this part of the edifice and its altars were then made we will conclude these observations by saying it is presumed this most elegant part of the edifice was finished by prior richard de hotoun who it is certain roofed the choir and acceded to the priory in      the pilasters of this transept from whence rise the groins of the roof are of an angular projection light and elegant on each side of the great window the pilasters consist of a cluster of small circular columns one of larger dimension in front and six on each side to form the projecting angle belted in two places at intervals with a triple roll the capitals pierced in flowers the pilasters between each window are composed of a front column and four on each side in an angler projection belted and capitalled as the larger ones every other column is of black marble the intermediate ones of white free stone which had a beautiful effect before they were from the mistaken zeal of reformation daubed over and concealed as they now remain with washing and oker under each tier of windows a gallery runs the whole length of the transept the nine altars were placed one under each window to the east the wall ornamented with short pilasters and open niches in the rose figure exactly similar to the gallery of the dome the vaulted roof is ribbed the ribs meet on three circles the silletings of the ribs are pierced like those of the choir with roses and crosses the circles are beautifully ornamented the most northern one being pierced with a rich garland of flowers that in the center is sculptured with four figures finely relieved representing the evangelists kneeling with their proper emblems the southern circle is of elegant sculpture exhibiting the revelation of christs nativity  the gallilee at the west end of the church as was observed before was by ancient authors said to be appropriated by bishop pudsey for the reception of women being originally designed for the service of processions it is in breadth from east to west fifty feet and from north to south eighty feet divided into five ailes by four rows of pillars running east and west three pillars and two pilasters in each range the pillars formed of four small round columns placed together whose base is only two feet square the pilasters consist of two round columns detached from the walls their capitals ornamented with a leaf and mouldings the arches are circular and cut underneath and on the sides with the zigzag figure the roof is not vaulted a plate in smiths life of bid  it is lighted with three large windows to the west with flat or elliptic arches and one smaller window at each extremity under pointed arches to the south four windows with pointed arches the north side is built up and used for the registers office the old entrance was from the north by a small yard adjoining to the churchyard so that the women need not come within the gates of the church the door circular with pilasters and mouldings greatly decayed the gallilee on the south side is now stalled and benched for

all women and solace of their soul there was an ancient church in the fern island where the church of that town now stands which was appointed for women to repair unto for hearing of mass and receiving the sacraments for which purpose here was a chapel dedicated to the blessed virgin mary now called the gallilee  hugh bishop of durham considering the diligence of his predecessors in building the cathedral church finished but a few years before his time and no chapel being then erected to the blessed virgin whereunto it should be lawful for women to have access began to erect a new work at the east angle of the cathedral for which several pillars of marble were brought from beyond sea and the work being advanced to a small height begun through great clifts therein to fall down whence it manifestly appeared unacceptable to god and holy st cuthbert whereupon that work was left off and a new one begun and soon finished at the west end of the church for women  it is called the gallilee by reason as some think of the translation thereof being once begun and afterward removed to which place whosoever resorted had the benefit of sundry pardons as appears by a table there set up containing a catalogue thereof  within the gallilee in a chantry made of blue marble stood our ladys altar a sumptuous monument finely adorned with curious wainscot work the wainscot furnished with pictures in colors and gilding there mass was sung daily by the master of the songschool with certain deacons and choristers the masters playing upon a fine organ in time of mass wherein the founder bishop langley was most devoutly prayed for this bishop magnificently rebuilt the said gallilee there belonged to this altar very sumptuous furniture not only for principal feasts but for ordinary service and for safekeeping those vestments and other ornaments belonging to the said altar there was at both ends behind the portal two close almeries of wainscot  thomas langley bishop of durham lies buried under a marble tomb within the said chantry before our ladys altar  on the north side of the gallilee was an altar called the lady of pitties altar with her picture carrying our savior on her knee as he was taken from the cross this altar was intended for a chantry priest to say mass at every day having above the altar on the wall a part of our saviors passion in large pictures the other part being above st bedes altar on the south side  there was on the south side between two pillars a beautiful monument of blue marble a yard high supported by five pillars one at every corner and the fifth under the middle and above the said marble stone and pillars stood a second shrine to st cuthberts wherein the bones of saint bede were inshrined it used to be taken down every festival day when there was any solemn procession and carried by four monks in time of procession and divine service it is not improper to transcribe the following verses from the ancient history  hugh bishop of durham having finished the chapel called the gallilee caused a feretory of gold and silver to be made wherein were deposited the bones of venerable bede in the lower part of the work the following latin verses were engraven continet haec theca bedae venerablis ossa sensum factori christus dedit atque datori petrus opus fecit praeful dedit hoc hugo donum sic in utroque

richardo de castro dicti bernardi cujus and ossa non procul hinc lapide sub marmoreo requiescunt   it appears that the bones of saint bede were first laid in the monastery of jarrow and afterward brought to durham and placed in a golden coffin on the right side of the body of st cuthbert  egfridus a priest in that time viz      did affirm that one coffin contained both the body of st cuthbert and the bones of the venerable dr bid  on the south side of the gallilee was st bedes altar before which his bones and relics lay where his shrine was to whose memory an elegant epitaph fairly written on vellum hangs upon the adjoining wall  see p      the reverend sir george wheler knight one of the prebendaries of this cathedral a true admirer of venerable bede had several of his children buried near him and ordered his own body to be interred as near bedes tomb as it conveniently could without violating the sacred ashes  adjoining to the bottom of the great window in the west end of the gallilee was a fine iron pulpit with iron rails to support the monks in going up of whom one did preach every holiday and sunday at one oclock in the afternoon  at the west end of the south angle was a font for baptizing children when the kingdom was interdicted by the pope which thomas langley bishop of durham procured as a privilege upon special favor at the popes hands  in the west end of the gallilee are four finely colored windows  in the first toward the south are three lights the middle having in it the picture of christ crucified curiously painted with the sun and moon above the head

colored glass as he was accustomed to say mass under his feet is written sanctus aidanus episcopus lindisfarnensis ecclesiae primus primus in hac sanctissima dunelmensi ecclesia fuit prioratus  under

accustomed to say mass under eatas picture is sanctus eata lindisfarnensis episcopus  and above in the highest part of this window are six little glazed lights in tower manner in fine colored glass

vol viii fo    b   the cloister the west alley of the cloisters in the west alley of the cloisters a little to the south of the dormitory door was a strong house called the treasury having a strong door and two locks upon it in the midst of the house was a strong grate of iron fixed in the groundwork and in the roof and fastened in each wall the breadth of the house so fast as not to be easily broken in the midst of the grate was an iron door with a strong lock and two great slots of iron to guard it and within the grate was a square table covered with green cloth for telling their money within this treasury were also kept the evidences of the house and the chapter seal as also the evidences of several gentlemens lands in the country who thought them safer than in their own custody in three great chests well locked in the said treasury but afterward it was altered their treasure and money being kept in a strong house over the east gates of the abbey in the south bailey now called the exchequer but in the said old treasury the common chapter seal is still kept  over against the said treasuryhouse door was a stall of wainscot where the novices were taught no strangers or other persons being permitted to molest the novices or the monks in their carrels while at study in the cloisters a porter attending for that purpose at the cloister door  a little south of the treasury was the songschool for the instruction of boys for the use of the choir the songschool in the south isle of the lanthern being decently furnished with a reading desk convenient seats and all other requisites where prayer was daily celebrated at six in the morning except on sundays and holidays  the dormitory on the west side of the cloisters was a large house called the dorter where the monks and novices lay every monk had a little chamber to himself each chamber had a window toward the chapter and the partition betwixt every chamber was close wainscotted and in each window was a desk to support their books on the west side of the said dorter were the like chambers with their windows and desks toward the infirmary and the water the chambers being all well boarded  the novices had likewise their chambers in the south end of the said dorter adjoining to the aforesaid chambers having eight chambers on each side every novice had his chamber to himself not having any light but what came in at the foreside of their chambers  at each end of the dorter was a square stone wherein was a dozen of cressets wrought in each stone being always filled and supplied by the cooks as they needed to afford light to the monks and novices at their arising to their mattins at midnight and for their other necessary uses  there was a decent place adjoining to the west side of the said dorter toward the water called the privies two great pillars of stone supported the whole floor thereof and every seat and partition was wainscotted close on every side  in the dorter every night a private search was made by the subprior who called at every monks chamberdoor to see good order kept and that none should be wanting the middle part of it was paved with fine tile stones the whole length the subpriors chamber was the first as he was to see order kept  the subprior always dined and supped with the convent sitting at the upper end of the table and supper being ended which was always at five oclock upon ringing a bell to call one of the novices to say grace they went to the chapter house to meet the prior there to remain in prayer and devotion till six oclock then upon ringing a bell again they went to the salvi and all the doors of the cells the fraterhouse the dorter and the cloisters were locked even at six oclock and the keys delivered to the subprior till seven oclock the next morning  the loft there was a door in the west end of the fraterhouse at which the old monks entered and then ascended up a pair of stairs having an iron rail into a loft which was at the west end of the fraterhouse above the cellar where the convent and monks dined and supped together the subprior sat at the upper end of the table as chief and they had their meat served from the great kitchen in at the dresserwindow and brought through the fraterhouse the said kitchen served both the prior and the whole convent having two windows into the fraterhouse the one was large for principal days the other not so large for every day at the foot of the stairs was another door leading into the great cellar or buttery where all the drink stood that served the whole convent  this loft since the dissolution of the monastry was made the dining room of the fifth prebendarys house  the monks were accustomed every day after dinner to go through the cloisters in at the ushers door and so through the entry under the priors lodgings into the centrygarth where the monks were buried where they all stood bareheaded a good space praying among the tombs for the souls of their brethren who were buried there and when they had done their prayers they returned to the cloister and staid till three oclock that they went to evensong  the monks were the only writers of the acts and deeds of the bishops and priors of the church and of other chronicles and histories they likewise recorded other most valuable things as what acts what occurrences and what miracles were performed every year such were the labors of monks and religious men in ancient times  the common house on the right hand at going out of the cloisters into the infirmary was the commonhouse it was to have a fire constantly by day in winter for the use of the monks who were allowed no other fire but the master and officers of the house had their own several fires a garden and bowling alley belonged to the said house toward the water for the novices to recreate themselves leave being first granted their master attending to see to their good order in this house once in the year between martinmas and christmas the master of it kept his o sapientia a solemn banquet at which the prior and convent were entertained with figs raisins ale and cakes but not to excess being only a moderate scholastical congratulation among themselves  the infirmary within the infirmary underneath the masters lodge was a strong prison called the lyinghouse ordained for great offenders as for monks guilty of felony or adultery where they were imprisoned in chains a whole year without seeing any one except the master of the infirmary in letting down their meat through a trapdoor by a cord and that at a great distance from the prisoners but if any of the temporal men belonging to the house offended in the premises they were punished by the temporal law  the guesthall a famous house of hospitality was kept within the abbeygarth called the guesthall and was situate on the west side toward the water the terrer of the house was master thereof appointed to give entertainment to all estates noble gentle or what other degree soever came thither as strangers their entertainment was not inferior to that of any place in england both for the goodness of their diet the clean and neat furniture of their lodgings and all things necessary for travelers and no man was required to depart while he continued honest and of good behavior  the houses belonging to the second third fourth and tenth prebendaries were erected out of the apartments and other offices belonging to the guesthall the hall itself being wholly demolished nothing remaining except a part of the western wall but nothing remains to let us know what was in the sixth and twelfth prebendaries houses  this hall was a stately place not unlike the body of the church supported on each side by very fine pillars and in the midst of the hall a large range for the fire the chambers and lodgings belonging to it were kept very clean and richly furnished they were very pleasant to lie in especially one chamber called the kings chamber well deserving that name such was the stateliness thereof  the victuals the guests were entertained with came from the great kitchen of the prior the bread and beer from his pantry and cellars if they were honorable they were served as honorably as the prior himself otherwise according to their quality  the terrer had certain men appointed to wait at his table and to attend upon his guests and strangers and for their better entertainment he had always a hogshead or two of wines kept in a cellar pertaining to the said hall  the prior whose hospitality was such as that in reality there was no need of the guesthall but that the convent was desirous to abound in all liberal and free almsgivings kept a most splendid and noble house being attended by the best gentlemen and yeomen in the country and the magnificent service of his house deserved no less constant relief and alms were daily given not only to the poor of the city but to those of the country round about  the lord prior had two porters one at the hall door called robert smith the other at the usher door at going from the great chamber to the church called robert clark which two were the last porters to the last prior  there were certain poor children called the children of the almery who were educated in learning and relieved with the alms and benevolence of the whole house having their meat and drink in a loft on the north side of the abbey gates before the suppression of the said house this loft had a long slated porch over the stairhead and at each side of the said porch were stairs to go up to the loft with a stable underneath it and a door into it under the stairhead to go into the said stable this edifice at the suppression of the house became mr stephen marleys lodging soon after the suppression he altered it and took down the porch and stairs that went up to the loft and made a kitchen where the stable was and his buttery above where the loft was the children went to school at the infirmary school without the abbey gates the last schoolmaster was sir robert hartburne who continued master till the suppression of the house he was bound to say mass twice a week at magdalens chapel near kepier and once a week at kimblesworth the meat and drink these children had was what the monks and novices with their master had left it was carried in at a door adjoining the great kitchen window into a little vault at the west end of the fraterhouse like a pantry called the covie within it was a window at which some of the children received the meat and drink out of the covie or pantry window and carried it to the loft this clerk waited on them at every meal to keep good order  there were four aged women who lived in the infirmary without the south gates of the abbey each having her several chamber to lie in being supplied and fed only with the victuals that came from the priors own table  in the infirmary was a chapel where the schoolmaster of the infirmary having his chamber and school above it or some other priest for him was appointed to say mass to these aged women every holiday and friday  davies etc   on the north side of the church is a quadrangle of one hundred and fortyseven feet having eleven windows on each front which it is said were glazed but are now open the mullions and tracery were lately repaired in a neat gothic style entering by the west door from the church the stairs leading to the dormitory are immediately on your right hand extending the whole length of the west cloister forty feet wide ill lighted and a melancholy mansion the center is flagged about six feet wide the sides having been boarded and enclosed for the monks cells under the dormitory was the songschool and treasury in the collection of records lodged here there are about ninety royal charters and grants fiftytwo deeds by nobles and barons and two hundred and sixtysix by inferior gentry about one hundred and thirtyone by popes bishops abbots priors and convents and other religious persons and houses and one hundred and thirty other original deeds and copies amounting in all to near the number of six hundred and seventy  the bishop of carlisle had a list of the charters of several of the kings and nobles of scotland granted to the abbey of coldingham kept in the dean and chapters treasury here communicated to him by the rev dr john smith preb  in lord crewes time   0  one anderson

attendants perceived that he could not live they sent for the priors chaplain who staid with him till he yielded up the ghost then the barber was sent for whose office it was to put down the cloths and uncover him and to put on his feetsocks and boots and to wind him in his cowl and habit thence he was carried to a chamber called the dead mans chamber in the infirmary there to remain till night at night he was removed into st andrews chapel adjoining to the said chamber and infirmary there to remain till eight oclock in the morning the chapel being a place ordained only for solemn devotion the night before the funeral two monks were appointed by the prior to be mourners and to sit all night on their knees at the feet of the corpse and the children of the almery sitting on their knees in the stalls on each side were to read davids psalms till eight in the morning when the corpse was carried to the chapter house where the prior and the whole convent met it and there said their dirge none being permitted to approach the chapter house during the time of their prayers for his soul when ended the corpse was carried by the monks from the chapter house through the parlour the place where merchants used to utter their wares standing betwixt the chapter house and churchdoor and so through the said parlour into the centrygarth where he was buried and a chalice of wax laid upon his breast having his blue bed held over his grave by four monks during the funeral which bed is due to the barber for his duty aforesaid and making his grave at the time of his burial only one peal was rung  the priors of the house of durham were accustomed in ancient time to be buried in their boots and wound in their cowls by the barber as the monks used to be buried  the priors in later times were buried within the church in the same order and habit with the mitre and all other furniture as their predecessors were buried  the bishops of durham used in ancient times to be buried in the

it being also the place where the bishop sits when he keeps his visitation for the cathedral church next to it a chair of wood is fastened in the wall where the priors did and the deans now fit at that visitation  in the south side of the chapter house was a prison to which such monks were committed for a certain time who had committed any slight offenses among themselves  in the chapter house above the great door is a fine glass window containing the offspring of the root of jesse in fine colored glass on the top is the picture of the blessed virgin with christ in her arms  the custom of burying bishops in the chapter house  the bishops of durham when they died were brought to the abbey church to be interred and the prior and monks met the corpse at the churchyard gates on the placegreen where they received and carried him through the church into the chapter house great solemnity and devotion according to the ancient custom was used the custom was to bury them with their albe stole phannel and other vestments wherein they used to say mass a mitre on the head and a crosier staff in his hand and so laid in the coffin with a little chalice of silver other metal or wax placed on the breast which wax chalice and the knobs and the edge of the patten or cover and the base were gilded  the prior and monks had the horses chariot and all other things that came with the deceased due to them by ancient custom  but afterward the bishops were buried in the church as their predecessors were in the chapter house  at the east end of the chapter house there is a yard called the centrygarth where all the priors and monks were buried in this garth was a vault made to be a charnelhouse to put dead mens bones in  there were many gentlemen of great worth buried in the centrygarth who desired to lie near holy st cuthbert and among others mr racket who had a fine tomb of white marble whereon he was pictured in brass in his coat of armor and his sword girt about him and at every corner of the marble was an evangelist in brass  mr elmeden was buried in the said garth with a fine tombstone upon him and diverse others whose monuments are perished  the priors buried in the centrygarth had each a tombstone either of marble or free stone which dean whittingham caused to be pulled down and taken away and broke and defaced all such stones as had any pictures of brass or other imagery work or chalices wrought upon them and the rest he took away and employed them in making a washinghouse  within the church were two marble holy water stones bossed with hollow bosses on the outsides curiously wrought these were taken away by dean whittingham and removed into his kitchen  in the centrygarth under the south end of the nine altars betwixt two pillars was a songschool erected for teaching six children to sing who had their meat and drink among the children of the almery at the expense of the house the master had his chamber adjoining to the songschool and his diet in the priorshall among the priors gentlemen  davies etc  william bishop of durham before he took down aldwinuss old fabric prepared a beautiful tomb of stone in the cloistergarth a yard above the ground where st cuthbert was deposited over which was laid a large marble but when his body was translated to the seretory made a large and curious marble image representing st cuthbert with beautiful gilding and painting in the form he was wont to say mass which was placed upon the tombstone as soon as his body was inshrined in the new church and round the same were set up wooden stanchels so close that a man could only look through it to view that exquisite picture it was covered above with lead not unlike a chapel this elegant monument stood opposite to the parlour door now turned into a storehouse having rooms above where the registeroffice is kept soon after the suppression dean horn demolished this fine monument converting the lead to his own use the image of st cuthbert he left perfect but when dean whittingham began to govern he caused this image to be defaced and broken  the east alley of the cloisters bishops skirlaw and langley were the builders of the cloisters the first gave two hundred pounds in his lifetime and by will four hundred pounds for that purpose the second gave two hundred and thirtyeight pounds seventeen shillings and sixpence these two were at the charge of the building and workmanship and caused to be painted on the glass in the windows from the cloister door to the church door the whole story and miracles of st cuthbert in king edward the sixths days this history was taken down by dean horn and broken to pieces  there was a godly ceremony practiced by the prior and monks every maunday thursday viz the thursday before easter eighteen aged poor men were appointed to come to the cloister that day having their feet first clean washed there to remain till the prior and the convent came which was about nine oclock they sat between the parlour door and the church door on a long form and the prior washed the poor mens feet one after another and dried them with a towel and kissed them when he had done this he bestowed thirty pence in money on each of them and seven red herrings apiece and served them with drink three loaves of bread and certain wafer cakes  at going out of the cloisters through an entry into the deanery at the top of the stairs behind the door called the usherdoor on the right hand was another going into the register wherein certain old written books of the records and evidences of the house were laid as also a copy of the foundation of greatham hospital which was also registered in the said book of records it was the registerhouse till tobias matthew dean of durham removed it into the parlour before mentioned  the north alley of the cloisters in the north side of the cloisters from the corner over against the church door to the corner opposite to the dormitory door was all finely glazed and in every window were three pews or carrels where every one of the old monks had a carrel to himself to which after dinner they resorted and there studied till the time of evensong these pews were

but to deduce from thence the following observations it has been apprehended that the mintage of our prelates was carried on in some strong place within the gates of the castle or as others would have it in silverstreet from its name whereas the records prove the mintmasters house was on the placegreen which was styled to be in the castle as being within the ballium and fortifications thereof  there were anciently belonging to the monastery two schools one in the cloister where the novices were taught in a wainscotted hall opposite to the treasury door the master was one of the oldest and most learned of the monks and the students were supplied upon his report with necessaries from the chamberlain of the house for they had no appointed salary if any of them showed a particular genius and love of literature he was sent to oxford those of meaner capacities pursued their studies under the discipline of the house were taught to perform the service of the choir and in the end admitted to sing mass at which stage they had twenty shillings a year as wages they had commons at a table at the east end of the fraterhouse and during the mess one of them read a portion of the holy scriptures their lodging was at the south end of the dormitory the other school was in the infirmary out of the abbey gates where the boys of the almery were taught they messed after the novices and had the remains of their table their master had ecclesiastical duty saying mass twice a week at st mary magdalens chapel near kepier once a week at kimblesworth and every holiday and friday in the infirmary chapel where four women constantly attended who dwelt in the infirmary to take care of the sick and were supplied with provisions from the priors table vide auditors office  these appointments with the rest of the monastic dispositions were extinguished by the dissolution and perhaps occasioned the institution of the other schools after the settlement of the chapter john newton master of st edmonds hospital in gateshead and john thoralby rector of gateshead and afterward of whitburn clerks by bishop langleys license dated the   th of june      founded two chanteries at the altars of the blessed virgin and st cuthbert in the gallilee and appointed two chaplains one of whom was to teach poor boys grammar and the other singing in such place as that prelate or his executors should appoint their stipend of forty shillings yearly each issued out of lands in hardwick nigh norton ryton boldon cassop and owengate in the northbailey the boys it is presumed from the instrument of confirmation by the prior and convent were to consist of thirty of the monastery almery the songmaster with some of his scholars were to come to church on the principal festivals in a surplice and sing the others to be present on the like occasions and no women were to be permitted among them the chantry clerks were not suffered to lie a night out of their house without license of the bishop or his spiritual chancellor under the penalty of forfeiting the chantry neither might they with any license be absent above forty days conjunctim aut divisim in a whole year and then to have a substitute they could not be admitted without license of the bishop or during the vacancy of the prior and chapter in which express mention was to be made of their taking the oath of residence the bishop had power to add to or detract from the articles of foundation to appoint statutes or alter and explain them at pleasure  d chartulary p                   there appears some confusion touching these chantries whether only one was founded by newton and thoralby and the other was the act of bishop langley for in the nomination of some of the clerks one of them is called bishop langleys chantry bishop nevil in the first year of his episcopacy granted license to the executors of bishop langley to purchase lands of forty pounds per annum value for maintenance of these chantry clerks vide rot cl nevil  mr thomas rud who was master of the chapter school in the churchyard had much occasion to look into those matters and was of opinion that newton and thoralby were in fact the original founders giving stipends of forty shillings each but that bishop langley afterward greatly enlarging the foundation the chantries took his name there is a long state of controversy between mr rud and mr pet nelson in randals mss and also many letters of bishop cosins on the subject of these schools  the bishops executors purchased the manor of kaverdley in lancashire out of which they allotted   l

nature remained some time in confusion two new schools were instituted in the second year of queen mary under the protection of the dean and chapter and the queen appointed stipends to be paid thereto out of the revenues of the church and though it does not appear the dean and chapter had any right to intermeddle with the money issuing out of kaverdley in lancashire yet certain it is a custom arose in the beginning of queen elizabeths reign to pay one half of the stipend that belonged to one of bishop langleys schools to the master of the new grammar school and the same has been regularly paid by the kings auditor one reason for this division might be that from the time of the foundation of the new school where the latin tongue was to be taught that language was disused in the other and it was appropriated for english rudiments and writing bishop langleys songschool has long fallen into disuse the patentee pays no attention to the institution and it has become a beneficial sinecure to

built by bishop tunstall  before we proceed in the description of the present edifice it is necessary to make some few observations on the form and construction of fortresses of the like date we remarked that it was probable there was a place of strength and defense on the castle hill before the conqueror returning from his scotch expedition thought it expedient in this province which was so necessary and natural a barrier against the more northern powers to erect a castle vide note vol i p      the castle upon tyne was a work of near the same period of time hoc anno gul rex misit

wise corresponds with any part of the fortress now under consideration and indeed it is difficult to determine what part of the present castle owes its origin to william the conqueror towers of an octagonal form we conceive were not uncommon with the normans yet we do not apprehend the present tower was of norman architecture the lofty mount most probably attracted the founders attention but we have met with very little evidence to support such a position the ingenious mr gross says vol i antiq of england and wales  d edit p    in lelands itinerary we have the following description the close

construction seems to have been pretty uniform the outsides of the walls were generally built with the stones nearest at hand laid as regularly as their shapes would admit the insides were filled with the like materials mixed with a great quantity of fluid mortar which was called by the workmen groutwork a very ancient method of building used by the romans and quoted by palladio and all the writers on architecture the angles were always coigned and the arches turned with squared stone brought from caen in normandy with which the whole outside was now and then eased sometimes instead of stone the insides of the walls were formed with squared chalk as is the castle of guildford when the normans found the ruins of an ancient building on the site of their intended structure they either endeavored to incorporate it into their work or made use of the materials as may be seen by many buildings of known norman construction wherein are fragments of saxon architecture or large quantities of roman bricks which has caused them often to be mistaken for roman or saxon edifices the general shape or plan of these castles depended entirely on the caprice of the architects or the form of the ground intended to be occupied neither do they seem to have confined themselves to any particular figure in their towers square round and poligonal oftentimes occuring in the original parts of the same building the situations commonly chosen were steep rocks cliffs eminences or the banks of rivers to this observation we must add that the fortifications on the ground now under consideration occupied or enclosed the whole summit of the hill the outward wall running along the very brink of the eminence and forming an oval figure at the northern extremity of which the castle stands on the neck of land where the ground descends swiftly to the lower town called the borough the river runs almost round the whole walled or fortified eminence except at that part where claypath or cluerport gate stands at which point the eastern or western channels drawing nearest together give the walled or fortified part of the town the figure of a horse shoe so that the river to those fortifications served in lieu of a moat the natural ascent from the river to the foot of some parts of the city wall is upwards of eighty perpendicular feet in towns mr gross says p   the appellation of ballium was given to any work fenced with palisades and some times masonry covering the suburbs but in castles was the space immediately within the outer wall when there was a double enceinte of walls the areas next each wall were styled the outer and inner ballia the manner in which these are mentioned in the siege of bedford castle sufficiently justify this position the castle was taken by four assaults in the first was taken the barbican in the second the outer ballia at the third attack the wall by the old tower was thrown down by the miners where with great danger they possessed themselves of the inner ballia through a chink at the fourth assault the miners set fire to the tower so that the smoke burst out and the tower itself was cloven to that degree as to show visibly some broad chinks whereupon the enemy surrendered  this receives further confirmation from the enumeration of the lands belonging to colchester castle wherein are specified the upper bailey in which the castle stands and the nether bailey etc the wall of the ballium in castles was commonly high flanked with towers and had a parapet embattled crenellated or garretted for the mounting of it there were flights of steps at convenient distances and the parapet often had the merlons pierced with long chinks ending in round holes called oillets whether at durham there was an inner and outer ballium is uncertain the two streets now called the baileys are sometimes distinguished by the names of the high and low bailey and north and south bailey and prompt an idea that such might be the original form of the fortification but when the present cathedral church was built the distinction and interior wall perhaps was removed as no remains thereof now appear  within the ballium were lodgings or barracks for those whose service it was to defend the castle personally either as principals or substitutes so in the baileys the houses were anciently held in capite by the service of castle ward and many chief

churches st mary the great or lebow and st mary the less  the entrance into the ballium was commonly through a strong machicolated and embattled gate between two towers secured by a hearse or portcullis over this gate were rooms originally intended for the porter of the castle the towers served for the corpse de guard on an eminence in the center commonly though not always stood the keep or dungeon sometimes as in the siege of bedford castle emphatically called the tower it was the citadel or last retreat of the garrison often surrounded by a ditch with a draw bridge and machicolated gate and occasionally with an outer wall garnished with small towers in large castles it was generally a high square tower of four or five stories having turrets at each angle in these turrets were the staircases and frequently as in dover and rochester castles a well if instead of a square the keep or dungeon happened to be round it was called a juliet from a vulgar opinion that large round towers were built by julius caesar groses antiq vol i  d edition p     we find mention made of five gates to the ballium the great north gate which flanked the keep to the east and filled up the space between it and the wall which led down into the borough this was of the greatest strength as it commanded the most important and least guarded approach when it was rebuilt by bishop langley he thought it necessary to make it as strong as the art of fortification could then render it not only as a defense to the fortress and monastery but as a prison for criminals and captives without lodging them

time of war when the exigencies of state required the gate to be closed for security of the city the gate was constantly closed at night by the owner of the adjacent tenement and no carriages were at any time suffered to pass that way until the rev henry egerton one of the present prebendaries of durham having purchased the adjacent grounds widened the street and promoted the building of a spacious arch of roman architecture without gates in the place of the old gateway this would have proved little more than an ornament to the city had not the dean and chapter with a munificence which distinguishes that worshipful body in all their public works laid it open for the use of gentlemens families whose carriages only are permitted to pass along the elegant new bridge lately erected by them a bounty reserved to this age  at this gate the ancient wall of the ballium appears stretching along the brink of the hill toward the church of st marylebow where kingsgate anciently stood the wall is defended at intervals with square projecting turrets or bastions but few of them retain so much of their original figure as to furnish a probable conjecture touching their strength when in a perfect state the wall shows evident marks of a parapet and breast wall or embrazure  in the first volume page     we offered some conjectures relative to the castle it is pretty well established that william the conqueror ordered a fortress to be erected here and it is probable the works which then defended the mount attracted the attention of the norman whether those works merited the name of a castle is not easy to determine or what they really were though from the mode of the saxons we may presume they consisted of breast works or circumvallations of which the present terraces may be some remains huntingdons language touching the sovereigns erecting a castle here de novo prompts an idea that some considerable edifice stood on this ground before the norman times the reader is desired to correct an error in p     touching the castle and read encourages for discourages ase the following and   about the year      the castle of durham consisted chiefly of a tower in the note referred to

lel col vol i p        it is only called turrim de dunelm and also in bishop hatfields time in the preceding note relative to the north gate in which it is described as leading to the tower and indeed many judicious persons with great probability have conjectured the original fortress was no more than a tower and was afterward strengthened with a ballium on the side opposite to framwellgate bridge garnished with bastions and square towers where the wall was built on the edge of rocks rising almost perpendicular from the river on this side several ancient towers yet remain of little use to the present mansion these towers have loopholes for the discharge of darts from engines  when framwellgate bridge was built by bishop flambard in the opening of the twelfth century he carried on a strong wall between the castle and the church and it is probable he built the last mentioned towers to command the pass the bridge had also a strong gateway and tower building this bridge necessarily occasioned a passage to be made from thence into the borough and on that account bishop flambard strengthened that side of the castle between the bridge and the north gate before spoken of with a moat which from the example before given was undoubtedly fortified with round towers or bastions the method of attack and defense of fortified places practiced by our ancestors before and even some time after the invention of gunpowder was much after the manner of the romans most of the same machines being made use of though some of them under different names they had their engines for throwing stones and darts of different weights and sizes for approaching the walls they had moveable towers groses antiq vol i  d ed p    and     so that the more lofty the fortification consequently it was more difficult of assault by the machines used in sieges of the vast force of the engines surprising stories are related no wall however thick was able to resist their stroke and in the field they swept away the deepest files of armed men with them were thrown not only large milstones but sometimes the carcases of dead horses and even living men the former according to froissart was practiced by john duke of normandy son of king philip de valois when he besieged the count of hainhault in thynleveque in the low countries and whom he thereby obliged to capitulate on account of the infection caused in the town and as camden says it was also done by the turks in negroponte the other namely throwing a living man is also mentioned by froissart it happened at the siege of auberoche in gascoigne where the english being closely pressed by the count de laisle lieutenant general to philip de valois they sent out an esquire with a letter which he was to endeavor to deliver to the earl of derby their general but being taken his letter was read and afterward tied round his ne and he being put into an engine was thrown back into the castle where he fell dead among his companions moveable towers are repeatedly mentioned as much in use particularly by the english froissart is very circumstantial in his account of one used at the siege of role by the earl of derby who having laid before that place nine weeks caused two towers three stoes gh to be built with large beams each tower was placed on four small wheels or trucks and toward the town covered with boiled leather to guard it from ire and to resist the darts on every story were placed  00 archers these towers were pushed by the force of men to the city wall the ditch having been led up whilst they were building from these the soldiers placed in the different stages made such  us discharges that none of the garrison except such as were well armed or covered with large  to show themselves on the rampart  gross vol i p     d edit   many of the keeps or dungeons in the ancient castles are placed in the same situation of the ballium as the castle of durham as connisborough castle tickhill portchester cambridge oxford tunbridge and several others the mount on which durham tower stands is near fortyfour perpendicular feet in height from the level of the placegreen to the foot of the building and it appears to have been forced from the level to the above eminence add the natural height of the whole hill from the level of the river and it will be upwards of one hundred and thirty perpendicular feet it is the opinion of a skilful architect mr geo nicholson who is director of the repairs now making at the cathedral  that the foundation of this tower goes down to the rock and by the falling in of some arches we discover that the whole erection is vaulted underneath but as those vaults from their apparent depth do not occupy above a fourth part of the height of the mount we are left to conjecture in what manner the rest of the eminence was forced or supported it is apprehended that after the norman tower was built the mount did not remain cut out into terraces agreeable to the present form but that the sides were regularly sloped from the building to the plain to render it as difficult to be climbed as possible forming a regular glacis or talus round the tower and that the approach to the gate of the tower was by a long slight of steps from the inner court so narrow that two persons only could pass at a time and so open on each side that an assailant opposed might be tumbled headlong to the bottom mr king describing coningsborough castle in the  th volume of the archaeologia says the first thing that strikes the eye is a very remarkable sloping part of the foundation walls rising to a great height like a mount and having in many parts in consequence of its being covered with earth and moss the appearance of a small hill exactly of the same dimensions as the castle itself the bottom of this sloping part appears almost circular but higher up are seen more fully six vast projecting buttresses ascending in a still more steep direction to prop and support the building immediately above this sloping part the tower rises perpendicularly to a great height its inside forms a complete circle but on the outside appear six additional square turrets which are however merely the continuation upwards of the buttresses just mentioned before the present terraces of our tower were formed perhaps the ribs of the foundation appeared supporting the buttresses of each angle and by such a base mining which was much practiced in antiquity would be impeded or rendered impracticable the tower of coningsborough castle forms an hexagon durham tower an illformed octagon of irregular sides some of the fronts exceeding others in breadth several feet the angles are supported by buttresses and a parapet has run round the summit of the whole building with a breast wall and embrazure the diameter of this tower in the widest part is sixtythree feet six inches and in the narrowest sixtyone feet it has contained four stories or tiers of apartments exclusive of the vaults the great entrance is on the west side there is nothing now left of this edifice but the mount vaults and outside shell which latter from its noble appearance and the great ornament it is to the city has been an object of attention of many of the prelates  chamber tells us bishop hatfield built a tower to the castle in castello dunelm aedificiae quae antiquitate and vetustate consumpta et debilitata fuerant renovavit and autam episcopalem and aulam constabulari cum aliis aedificiis in eodem de novo construxit urbem dun licet hanc natura and muri satis munierunt turre tamen fortiori sumptibus suis in castello constructa ipse reddidit fortiorem indeed from the whole mode of architecture the roses which ornament the summits of the buttresses and the form of the windows we are led to conceive that the present shell was the work of bishop hatfield and repaired and kept standing by his successors on the east side of the tower under the arms of lord crew hc diu rutturi castelli latera cu vetustate

was only lined round the outward wall with apartments so as to leave an inner area or wall from top to bottom by which the engines of war and necessaries in time of danger and attack were drawn up and distributed to the several parts of the building those apartments have been approached by five different staircases or turnpikes in the angles the remains of which are yet visible so that the parapet could be mounted the galleries lined with armed men and the apartments guarded in a very short time and equally as quick the garrison could descend and be ready for a sally at present the mount as we observed before is formed into terraces as well for ornament as recreation the uppermost terrace is ten feet wide and laid with gravel commanding a prospect not only of the whole city and its beautiful environs but also an extensive view of the country as far as gatesheadfell penshaw newbottle warden law and quarrington with the nearer objects newtonhall pittington sherburn aykleyheads and other places of note between this and the lower terrace is a grass slope supported by a breast wall and you descend by twentythree steps the second terrace is of equal breadth with the other and laid with gravel and is in like manner separated from the lowest terrace by a grass slope and breast wall to which you descend by twentyone steps this terrace is of like width and form as the others and is twentytwo steps above the level of the garden below  bishop pudsey who acceded to the bishopric in      restored some part of the castle which had suffered by fire to this prelate we are induced to attribute the building of the first hall to the palace but with other parts of the castle going to decay the present hall with the constableshall were afterward erected by bishop hatfield this prelates works were magnificent an improved taste prevailed in his time and much ornament was introduced in buildings of this kind the hall erected by him we are told was near one hundred and twenty yards in length of a proportionable height and width and lighted on every side the roof of wood was ornamented in every rafter and other decorations were given to this spacious room it is described as having two princely eats one at each end there were pulpits or galleries on each side wherein the trumpeters or wind music used to stand to play while meat was ushered in vide vol i p     also note

away the seat at the south end and converted that part into a kitchen and stewards apartments so that it was lessened at least onethird of its original size yet there remained room enough for the entertainment of the princess margaret and her attendants in her way to scotland on that occasion we read that all the nobility and people of distinction of the northern parts as well spirituals as temporals were present and the services consisted of that gorgeous display of provisions called by the writers of that time double dinners this prelate began to repair the great tower and built a hall kitchen and some other apartments therein but before his plan was far advanced he was translated and no further progress was made in that work we see his arms in the partition wall of the great hall bishop tunstall made great repairs to the castle he built the present gateway and tower and flanked it with a strong wall on either hand he brought water to the palace in pipes it being supplied before by wells and reservoirs he erected the present gallery and made a new approach to the apartments there he also built a beautiful little chapel which has received improvements from succeeding prelates as the arms of cousin and talbot placed therein denote we should not omit to remark in this place that on the facing of the entrance into the stalls at the west end is a striking mark of wolseys arrogance on the oak are carved the cardinals arms taking the dexter side against the arms of his principality and see of durham bishop barnes and neile made great repairs the latter enlarged the windows and thereby gave the apartments a new degree of elegance  the great tower became an object of encumbrance soon after the reformation and at length in bishop mortons time it was one of those erections for which the bishops were decreed to be discharged from future dilapidations so that nothing but the love of ornament and the solemn grace it added to the aspect of the castle in particular and to this beautiful city in general has since that period for a century and a half saved it from utter demolition and ruin  bishop morton had the honor of a royal visit at his castle of durham and then displayed the ancient hospitality and magnificence of the prelates of this see he entertained king charles i and all his retinue in the hall of this palace when he made his tour into scotland expending as it is said no less a sum than fifteen hundred pounds a day on the occasion bishop cousin whose memory is dear to those that venerate the ancient seats of our prelates put the castle of durham into repair made a new entrance into the hall renewed the fountain added many apartments and gave much ornament to the exterior parts he again reduced the hall by taking off an audience room at the north end at the foot of the great staircase and put a screen of wainscot at the south end to conceal the passages to the kitchen and offices he also wainscotted the hall round about in its present state the hall is one hundred and eighty feet in length thirtysix feet in width and about fifty feet in height to the rafters is lighted by three large windows to the west and two to the east since bishop cosins time succeeding prelates have made improvements which as well as the work of more remote ages are distinguished by the arms placed on various parts of the building bishop trevor did a great deal particularly to the north front which opens upon a terrace eighty paces long above the moat terminated by the round tower before spoken of he improved many of the apartments by putting in chimneypieces of stonework highly wrought in the gothic style and well adapted to the figure of the rooms making very large sash windows in the same order and stuccoing the walls and ceilings in which work he employed the ablest masters we have not been able to collect from the records before us what number or complement of men formed the military establishment of this castle the inquisitions post mortem which specify the ward service in the bailies might be brought into one view but the calculation to be drawn from thence would not be conclusive as those provided but a small portion of the armed men liable to be brought to that duty therefore it would prove a useless labor under the succession of bishops we have shown who were governors of the castle and the other officers whose names appear in the patents and appointments are placed under every prelate to repeat them in this place would be superfluous     the church of saint marylebow is said to stand

inadequate ideas which language can convey are to be lamented by the reader who has a taste for rural beauties and the elegance of landscape the church of st giles stands upon very elevated ground open to the south where the view is unobstructed in front the meadow grounds form a steep descent to the river on one wing closed by the wood called pelaw wood on the other by the buildings of the street at the foot of the hill the river were forms a beautiful canal almost a mile in length terminated by elvet bridge to the right and by the wooded enclosures of old durham on the left on the opposite shore is the race ground consisting of an extended tract of level meads from whence by a gradual ascent rise the two elvets the street of old elvet running parallel the other obliquely bordered with gardens and terminated by elvet church a handsome structure the channel of the river lying between new elvet and the bailies affords an agreeable break or change in the objects the sloping gardens being seen over the buildings of elvet softened to the eye with that pleasing teint which the distance produces on the brink of the ascent stand the bailies object rising gradually above object guarded with the remains of the town wall and crowned with the cathedral church which in this view presents the north and east fronts like the mitre which binds the temples of its prelate giving the noblest supreme ornament to the capital of the principality to the right elvet bridge with seven arches receives the stream and intercepts a further view of the progress of the river over it tier above tier rise the buildings of sadlerstreet the gloomy and solemn towers of the gaol and the battlement and octagonal tower of the castle the trophies of civil jurisdiction wearing the aspect of old secular authority and the frowns of feudal power between the chief objects the cathedral and castle on the nearer back ground southstreet with its hanging gardens makes a fine curvature behind which brandon mount with a spit of high land extending toward auckland form the horizon further to the right from the banks of the river rise the buildings of the marketplace crouding the tower of the church from whence the streets of claypeth and gillygate extend thus far description has proceeded without much faultering but in the other divisions of the scene it is faint and totally inadequate whoever would know the rest must come and view it see the view placed as a headpiece to the first page of this volume  over the meadows in the center a precipice rises near one hundred perpendicular feet in height called maiden castle fear or cliff the steep sides of the hill to the right and left are covered with a forest of old oaks and the foot of the cliff is washed by the river whose stream appears again at this point the lofty ridge of hills clothed with oaks stretching away forms a zizzag figure at the most distant point of which the great southern road up the new enclosed grounds of elvet moor is seen climbing the hill for near a mile beyond which very distant eminences form a bluetinged horizon to the left of maiden castle cliff you look upon a rich valley highly cultivated extending nearly five miles in length and two in width bending to the southwest through which the river winds its silver stream in the figure of an s hanging woods shut in each side of the nearer vale where are finely disposed the pleasant village of shincliff the bridge of three arches the villa of william rudd esquire and houghhall house the extreme part of the valley is closed by the woods of shincliff butterby and croxdale forming an elegant amphitheatre over these rise distant hills lined out with enclosures giving the yellow and brown teint to the landscape over the richer colored woods the whole finished with an elevated horizon on the wings of which are scattered the villages of ferryhill and merrington the tower of merrington church forming a beautiful and lofty obelisk one of the greatest excellencies of this landscape is that the ground rises gradually before you and just such a distance is maintained as preserves all the objects distinct not like the landscapes painted by the flemish and dutch masters to the left you look down upon old durham house its terraces and hanging gardens with a fine bend of cultivated country stretching away through another opening of the hills toward the east bounded by the high grounds of quarrington and the cliffs of coxhoe limekilns more rustic than the other views and being in a simpler nature affords a pleasing variety to the eye of the man of taste who stands if we may be allowed the extravagant expression on this enchanted ground mr doubledays house which is covered with lead commands from the roof the whole of this prospect with a wide though much less beautiful view to the northward   old durham house is gone to decay nothing now remaining but apartments for a farmer it was anciently the seat of the booths afterward of the cockburns lords of ormston and in more modern times became the estate of the tempests to which latter family it passed by intermarriage with the heiress of the heaths the gardens are formed into terraces of a considerable length this sweet retirement is become a place of public resort where concerts of music have frequently been performed in the summer evenings and the company regaled with fruit tea etc the gardens are open all summer for rural recreation the terraces command the elegant valley prospect before described  at the corner of the garden some few years ago were the remains of a very ancient building with a circular window and other appearances of the chapel form when the scots burnt the hospital of sherburn it is probable they destroyed the camera here of poulton grainge ramside and ravensflat mentioned in the book of rates to lie in this parish there is nothing remarkable from a pamphlet entitled a brief view of ecclesiastical jurisdiction etc addressed to nathaniel curzon bart and the rest of the committee appointed by parliament for inquiring into the abuses and corruptions of ecclesiastical courts and jurisdictions london printed for j peele       i have now by me a most moving and lamentable account contained in about sixty letters sent me by mr j tempest of old durham formerly a member of your house complaining of the most barbarous and tyrannic proceedings of the spiritual and temporal courts there against his person estate and property that ever was known to have been practiced in any court of law or justice whatever and this as he says chiefly promoted and carried on by a confederacy between the bishops chancellor and sheriff who by their under officers and agents have illegally seized upon whatever of his property they can lay their hands on on pretense of an outlawry or excommunication of which he had no notice till the seizure was actually made and that upon application to his sovereign the bishop for redress he has been denied all manner of relief and therefore entreats me to represent his case to you the parliaments committee which i am now preparing to that end w

in the parish of st oswald and so all the ancient muniments tend to confirm it is conjectured when the bishop erected a new free borough for merchants in elvet the distinctions of the borough of elvet and the old borough of durham first arose was there not much evidence to show there were distinct places called the old and new borough out of the bounds of the city and in the limits of st oswalds parish we should not have insisted on the position so positively when the old borough of durham had its rise from whence or what were its privileges we remain ignorant but the evidence we shall produce leads us to judge the old borough of durham comprehended the whole parish of st oswald subtracted from croxdale and that on the institution of the borough of elvet limits and bounds were set to the new borough and the rest remained to the old borough admitting this conjecture it will follow that the old borough comprehended crossgate southstreet etc now st margarets chapelry and in fact circumscribed the new borough it is not material to press this subject further than to support our first position that old durham and the old borough of durham were the first settlements of the saxons here before they built their church on the summit of the hill and from thence those places derived their present name  on the cliff before described in the view from gillygate church is the platform now called maiden castle mr j cade of durham in a tract published in the  th vol of the archaeologia p    has mentioned this place and some works at old durham extracts from which are placed here that the reader and particularly the traveller may judge for himself on the subject in the first place then i would observe that there are several camps or stations in this county which were undoubtedly of roman original but being subsequently occupied by different tribes of adventurers and altered according to their respective modes of defense this circumstance has caused their primary occupancy to be overlooked by antiquaries i shall mention particularly those of mainforth and maiden castle now old durham etc the latter is the property of j tmpest esquire and lies within half a mile of this city measuring according to dr stukeleys account about five hundred feet in length etc our camp at maiden castle i suppose may have derived its name from the british word mad pulcher or fair which the rev mr pegge thus ingeniously explains in treating of the maiden way or maiden castle in the county of westmerland and which term is particularly applicable to the delightful situation of old durham it also has a better claim to be considered as the condurcum of the romans from which it is about two miles distant than the camp near sunderland bridge which is evidently of danish construction and which the annotator upon camden says was the opinion of a very great antiquary i may likewise observe with the learned mr whitaker and others that the romans had generally a summer and a winter station situated within a few miles of each other and often on opposite sides of the same river which entirely coincides with the situation of chester and this camp the former might be the summer station and this the winter in hollinsheds chronicle first edition p     we have an account of a memorable siege which this place sustained in favor of king athelstan against an army of scots and danes commanded by godfrey brother to anlaf and son to sithric the danish king of the northumbrians about the year   0 under the title duresme duresme appears to have been a name introduced by the normans on account of the fortress built here after the conquest to keep the natives in subjection  though the foundations of the present city were not laid till sixty years afterward and marianus mentions a synod being held at dunelhoo ao     this station i imagine was formerly thought of great consequence but it at length suffered the rate of many others in the northern parts when william the conqueror made that horrid devastation between york and this place and erected his castrum in the new city a melancholy instance of this depopulation amongst many others is to be met with at acley or acliff in this county which may probably derive its name from acca bishop of hagustald in the beginning of the eighth century and where sir henry spelman mentions two saxon councils having been held annis     and     about a mile from the aforesaid village after the grass is cut the foundations of a considerable town with a large church in form of a cross are very conspicuous  the fortifications were then partly levelled but enough is left to point out its former magnitude and importance it being in my opinion much larger than dr stukeley his description is as follows iter boreale p  0 eastward over the river were upon another peninsula of high ground i saw a camp called maiden castle which i judge to be roman it is almost encompassed too by a rivulet falling into the river from the east it is of an oblong form five hundred feet long very steep on three sides the neck is guarded by a rampart and without that at some little distance by a ditch the prospect is large more especially eastward has described and the rivulet pidding has with great labor and ingenuity been diverted from its original channel where it ran into the were near shinkley bridge to answer the purpose of the fosse along the southern and western sides of it a gentleman with whom i am acquainted has carefully surveyed the old road from this place by kepyer hospital and he assures me that in a dry season the piers of a bridge are obvious in the bed of the river seemingly of roman construction and i have authority to say that coins have been formerly ploughed up here and lately some of the lower empire have also been discovered within its vicinage the ground plot and ramparts of the watch tower which served for signals to this station are visible and almost entire at the entrance of gillygate moor and exactly correspond in form with those on the roman wall in northumberland at newtonhall likewise on the opposite side of the river there has been an exploratory castrum seemingly for the security of old durham and chesterlestreet  maiden castle he places at old durham and supposes it a roman camp to illustrate his subject the tract is attended in the archaeologia with a plate which represents the supposed face of a vallum and shows in the back ground a round mount this supposed vallum is at present so much levelled that if ever it was forced it now appears no otherwise than the swift slope of the bank on the side of the brook and the mount is only a natural swell or rotundity of the back ground the plot of ground chosen by this gentleman for the station or camp on the northwest side nearest to old durham and where the brook does not run shows some deep trenches and high earth fences but the whole is so irregular that it is not possible to derive any distinct figure from the remains of the works he quotes hollinsheds chronicle to support a conjecture that about the year   0 this place sustained a siege we beg leave to compare this authority with others referred to in the  d page of this volume we have not been fortunate enough in our reading hitherto to discover any evidence that william the conqueror when he laid waste the country destroyed this place or that it suffered the fate of many others in the northern parts and that the fortifications were then partly levelled  dr stukeleys description may perhaps more happily be applied to the place described by us and delineated in our plate it is certainly of high ground hanging over the river and almost full east of the city of an oblong form one hundred and seventy paces long on the most extended side which comes almost accurately to his description five hundred feet long very steep on three sides the neck guarded by a rampart and without that at some little distance by a ditch the last circumstance noted by that author fixes the point the prospect is large more especially eastward the elevation of old durham ground pointed out by mr cade no part is above fifteen feet from the plain where any slope lies upon the margin of the brook and the prospect consequently is bounded eastward by the termination of the vale at the rising grounds of shincliff not more than a quarter of a mile distant  mr cades positions in the treatise from whence the foregoing extract is made may it is hoped without an invidious appearance be shortly commented on to the intent the reader may form a competent idea of the circumstances or be led to enquire for himself upon the spot    inaccessible from the river by reason of the steepness of the cliff which is almost perpendicular and about one hundred feet in height  on the right and left the steep sides of the mount are covered with a thick forest of oaks the crown of the mount consists of a level area or plain forty paces wide on the summit of the scar in the front or north east side one hundred and sixty paces long on the left hand side and one hundred and seventy paces on the right the approach is easy on the land side from the southwest fortified with a ditch and breast work the entrance or passage over the ditch is not in the middle but made to correspond with the natural rise of the outward ground probably this entrance was guarded by a drawbridge the ditch is twelve paces wide and runs with a little curvature to each edge of the slope now covered with wood as before noted on one hand being fifty paces in length on the other eighty paces after passing the ditch there is a level parade or platform twenty paces wide and then a high earth fence now nine feet perpendicular which as in most places of the like kind it is apprehended was faced with masonwork a breast work has run from the earth fence on each hand along the brink of the hill to the edge of the cliff or scar the earth fence closes the whole neck of land and is in length one hundred paces forming the southwest side of the area these particulars are illustrated by the annexed plate it is most probable this was the vetus burgus dunelmensis noted in the records it is at a little distance from the head of the street called old elvet in a direct line therewith and opposite to old durham the river dividing it from the latter place and almost filling up the intervening space it was supported anciently as is presumed by another fortress called the peel erected on the opposite eminence which now bears the name of peel law many places in the northern counties retain the name of peel and law implying castle and hill whose antiquity may be traced back to the saxon times we presumed to offer an opinion in the preceding pages that in the valley overlooked by this fortress the wandering saxons sat down with the remains of saint cuthbert and we submit to the candor of the reader whether that idea is altogether vague and improbable the name of maiden applied to a castle is now become indefinite whether it imples beautiful or a fortress which never has been conquered has not been determined our best antiquaries give preference to the distinction fair or beautiful the old fort on stainmore in westmoreland is called maiden castle and the adjoining enclosures bear the name of peelyard  bishop carilepho on his bringing in the canons

remains of st cuthbert in french history we find a definition of this historical title for there the name of montjoye is given to heaps of stones laid together by pilgrims on which crosses are erected when they come within view of the end of their journey and so betwixt st dennis in france and paris they are called st denniss montjoyes when the travelers bearing st cuthberts remains arrived here

tranquil stream glides at the bottom of the hill reflecting the noble objects which crown her banks here the opening valley pours forth a rivulet and there the solemn dell with natures wildest beauties yawns with broken rocks which yield the living fountain from their lips whilst each brow is crowded with bending oaks whose naked talons and twisted arms rival each other in grotesque figure

level plot which is almost covered with the buildings sheltered to the north by the lofty rocks and hanging woods of cocken and on every other side by steep hills the river flows swiftly over a rocky

rising from small round columns or pilasters with plain capitals the nave is twentyeight paces in length and seven in width in the center of the cross it appears there has been a tower or spire supported on four circular pillars very short and heavy exceeding even part of durham cathedral for disproportion the pillars are so massive that one of them contains a turpike staircase which led to the superstructure they form a square of equal sides twentyone feet from pillar to pillar the capitals of an octagonal form the center had a dome or vaulted roof with intersecting ribs and on the east side one pointed arch remains in the etching given in stevens monasticon drawn by king a short octagonal spire of stone is placed on the tower on the north side of the nave are four pillars supporting pointed arches the pillars round with capitals formed of double rolls constructed of a durable stone and entire the south side is close a long cloister or passage running on the outside to communicate with the south limb of the cross the north and south limbs of the cross are exactly equal in length and width being twelve paces long and seven broad they are very ill lighted one great window in the south limb toward the east being the chief indeed it appears that those parts have been added to the original structure or rebuilt as they are in no wise similar to the other parts in masonry or materials the choir is remarkable from the east window ten paces in length it is enclosed with high dark walls and from thence to the cross being nine paces the whole nineteen paces long are two round columns on each side similar to those in the nave bearing three pointed arches the east window has been sive paces wide as appears from the measurement of the sole for all the rest is gone with outward buttresses ornamented with stone pinnacles one of which on the south side still remains it is very singular that windows of a modern date have been placed between the pillars to fill up the arches formed of a yellow and perishable kind of stone which work now separates itself from the arches the yellow stone has been won from the bed of the river and is of the same kind with those of which the outbuildings are constructed the columns and arches are of a bluer nature and in no wise injured by time they seem to be of the normandy stone much like the columns and castings of several of the ancient castles allowing this observation to be just we should be apt to conjecture these columns and arches originally divided the center from a side aile but on strict search no foundations or other work was discovered which could encourage this idea if there were no side ailes then this was a fabric of singular construction for it will follow that the nave and part of the choir were open to the air on the sides like a cloister there is something similar in the abbey of furness in lancashire where a part on the north side is open the founder in imitation of the severities of st godric might think it expedient to deprive the monks of indulgence and leave the church open to the air but in after ages when the religious professed more outside show than real zeal yielded to the fascinations of luxury and studied gratifications and softness they closed the arches with windows made covered passages and transformed this building to its present model as its solenm beauties are much admired if the windows were displaced and the columns and arches laid open it would greatly improve its appearance and render it still a finer objet from the walks of cocken  the rest of the monastic buildings are very ragged and ruinous in one part a bow window is projected from a pilaster in the wall and seems to have appertained to some chief apartment the hall or refectory has been a handsome edifice it stands on the south side of a court nearly of equal sides about twentysix paces every way is twelve paces long and eight wide within the walls having five regular windows to the south and four to the north in the staircase or entrance is a large window to the south the vault underneath is supported by a row of four octagonal pillars in the center without capitals from whence the groins are sprung the pilasters in the walls and angles are capitalled the ribs are of hewn stone meeting in points and the interstices of the vault wedged with thin stones the whole a fine piece of architecture this vault is lighted by six small windows to the south and is not above eight feet in height to the crowns of the arches  it is said that st godric and also henry de puteaco or pudsey

preceding account of elvet bridge    it seems the measure was ineffectual for his successor bishop skirlaw erected a stone bridge of three arches which stood till the year      when the violent flood on the  th of february undermined and threw down one of the piers which carried with it two of the arches the bridge was restored the following summer at the public expense an engraving was published from a drawing of the ruins made by the author but the plate falling into roper hands was destroyed  it is said shincliff was the birth place of bishop sever abbot of st marys york we find the family of aslakby had possession here in bishop langleys time it has been the seat of the family of the hoppers of late years whose present representative is robert hopper williamson esquire  near this village william rudd esquire built his villa seated in a delightful retirement commanding a solemn view of the sequestered vale with its hanging woods which form a beautiful amphitheatre a scene excellently adapted to study and contemplation  on the other side of the river stands houghall part of the prebendal lands of the church the manor house was built by prior hotoun who notwithstanding the embarrassments he suffered under the persecuting spirit of bishop bek completed this and other considerable pious works no certain etymology of the name of this place is obtained from its situation in a low and watery plain we may adopt the word hough which in this country has acceptance for a plain by the side of the river which is sufficiently descriptive of the site of this place there was in the cathedral church as before noted an altar called howalls altar erected perhaps by some benefactor who bestowed this place on the church or indeed it might be called hotouns hall from the prior who built it in the thirteenth century the corruption to houghhall seems a familiar one the house has been moated round and otherwise fortified tradition says sir arthur hazelrigge possessed it and that oliver lodged there for some time it is certain it was refitted and perhaps put into a state of defense by some of that party the arms of cromwell now remain on one of the mantlepieces in the house  at the distance of a mile to the southwest but on the opposite side of the river stands  butterby anciently written beautrove from its beautiful situation the river were runs almost round the chief part of the estate the neck of land which divides the streams being only about two hundred yards wide here it has been imagined stood the ancient hospital of st leonard the founder and institution not now known the lands are remarkably fertile the river near the house falls swiftly over a rough channel under high rocky shores and hanging woods on the more distant side of the estate the river flows deep and slow forming a canal a mile in length where the adjacent lands make a considerable plain there is not a sweeter rural scene in the whole county unadorned and in simple nature for art has not yet extended her hand hither further than in the ordinary course of agriculture as this place is remarkable for its beauty so it is for natural curiosities surrounded with the river from the fissure of a rock which lies about forty feet from the shore flows a considerable spring of salt water mixed with a mineral quality the situation of this spring subjects it to a mixture of fresh water so that it is difficult to know how much salt it contains in its purest state on several trials it has yielded double the quantity produced from sea water the shore for a considerable distance shows many ouzings or small issues of salt water from which circumstance and by a dike or break of the rocks in the channel of the river a little above the spring it is presumed a rock or bed of salt might be won of some value it has never been searched for the family who lately possessed the estate from a love of retirement and ease neglected a trial the spring is much resorted to in summer for its medical qualities but as the well is not enclosed by any building it is frequently overflowed by the river this water is reputed to be an effectual remedy for a disease known among people employed in smelting and refining houses belonging to the lead works half a pint is sufficiently purgative for the strongest person within a few yards of the salt spring on the opposite shore is a fluent spring strongly impregnated with sulphur without any vitriolic or other compound we find the following account of this spring in gibsons edition of camden which is transcribed almost literally from bakers chronicle  the spadacrene is between butterby and durham on elvet moor  a little below branspeth the were has many huge stones in its channel never covered but when the river is overflowed by rains upon these if you pour water and it mix a little with the stone it becomes brackish a thing which happens nowhere else nay at butterby a little village when the river is shallow and sunk from these stones in the summer time there bursts out of them a reddish salt water which grows so white and hard by the heat of the sun as has been thought that they who live thereabouts use it for salt but that the saltness itself proceeds not from the heat of the sun is plain by experience in that which is most saltish and issues out of a rock in as much as if all the water be laved out of the place there immediately bubbles out of the body of the rock a water as salt as the former and besides the rock out of which it issues is a salt rock of a sparkling substance on the other side of the were there is also a medicinal spring of strong sulphur and above it toward durham is a mineral water of the vitriolic kind upon which dr wilson wrote his spadacrene dunelmensis  in lowthorps abridgment of the philosophical transactions vol ii p     the following account is inserted given by mr hugh todd  about a mile and a half out of durham on the north east side near butterby was lately discovered a medicinal spring which is much frequented and may be of great benefit to the country it was found by workmen that dug in that place for coal when they were twelve fathom and a half deep they discovered this treasure of natural physic they then tried the rock about one hundred yards off where they lost themselves much about the same depth and instead of coal discovered an excellent spring of clear water which issues out of the hole their instruments made these springs are in a deep gill or valley on the shore opposite to butterby  ibid vol ii p     p mr todd  at saltwater haugh near butterby about a mild and a half from durham in the middle of the river were rises a salt spring it is good to be seen and tasted only in the summer time when the water is discharged all on one side of the channel for in winter when the river is high it loses its salt in the fresh streams so that they e not perceivable the water seems to bubble up equally in all parts of the channel for the space of foy ads in length and about ten in breadth the filtest of all the springs issues out of the middle of a rock the surface of which was manifestly saltish and which in a hot day as i was told would be all covered over  a persect salt i had all the water laved out of the place where it seemed to stagnate and immedia out of the body of the rock there bubbled up water as salt as the former it was as high as any brine can be and though but little in quantity in comparison of the fresh river yet of that force to give a brackishness to the ca one hundred yards below those that have boiled this brine say that it affords a great quantity  baysalt n so palatable yet as useful as ordinary salt is it tinges all the stones with a red color the ea is eight miles off where nearest     the prospect from an adjacent headland called croxdale scar is deservedly admired by every visitant it commands an extensive view of the valley toward the west with the channel of the river for several miles through a country highly cultivated over a fine plain at the distance of a mile are seen sunderland bridge of four arches with croxdale the beautiful seathouse of william salvin esquire on the

enclosures to the right you look down upon the vale of butterby belted round with the crystal waters of the were and the eye traces its varied shores its rocks and sylvan scenes beyond which lies an extended valley terminated by the village of shincliff and enclosed on every side with lofty forests  the manorhouse of butterby stands in a pleasant garden which with the whole offices are enclosed by a deep moat walled round and though now dry is capable of being filled with water to the depth of    feet the entrance is by a strong gateway and bridge the secluded situaion of the house shuts it from distant prospects but such as it commands are romantic and rural in cleansing the moat some years ago in a large stone trough were found a coat of mail with a cap of chain work quilted in canvas

reign as we do not find beautrove in any future inquisitions taken on the deaths of the lumley family we may conclude it passed as a marriage portion with margaret one of the daughters of ralph lumley

falling streams of the brook the gloom of the thick foliage the grotesque rocks the spreading arms of the oaks the grassy plots that border the rivulets all conspire to please the mind that has a taste for solitude romantic scenes and rural meditation was a little art employed to smooth the paths to remove some few deformities and with a skilful hand to dress the wild beauties of the vale we know not where a more extraordinary scene could be found the dell is so deep that on very few days in the year the suns rays touch the millhouse and a person might live there for an age and never enjoy that spectacle in days of deep ignorance and superstition this dell was thought to be the residence of evil spirits an idea which gained credit perhaps from its being a place resorted to by robbers and vagabonds to banish the infernal inhabitants a cross was erected here which gave name to the adjacent lands this being in several old writings wrote croixdale so the desert of crossfell in

north marches spoiling and burning and took by force the pyle of lydelle and causid the noble knight walter selby captain of it to be slain before his own face not suffering him so much as to be confessed and after he came to the cost of dyrham and lay there at a place caullid beaurepaire a manor of the prior of duresme set in a park and thither resorted many of the cuntery about compounding with him to spare their grounds and manurs then william souch archbishop of york the count of anegos mounseir john de montbraye mounseir henry de percy mounseir rafe de neville mounseir rafe de

sir william duglas killing of his band  00 men and he with much pain escapid to burepaire to king david declaring the cuming of the english host where then king david issued and faught upon a more nere to duresme town and there was taken prisoner and with him sir wylliam douglas the count of menethe and the count of fyfe and great number of the communes of scotland slain the king because he was wondid in the face he was carried to werk and there he lyd and thens brought to london we have repeated this account because it contains some circumstances not named by modern authors the year in which this battle was fought was productive of the most glorious laurels that wreathed the sword of edward iii and the scotch received such humiliations as that nation never before experienced the king of england with an army greatly inferior to his foes by the valor and intrepid conduct of his heroic son obtained a glorious victory at cressy he then formed a blockade before calais which with other distresses induced the king of france to send proposals to the court of scotland for making an invasion on the borders the absence of edward the vast supplies of men and money which his campaign required the exhausted state of england afforded a probable appearance that davids projected expedition might be attended with success the king of frances object was not honor to the scotch crown but to amuse the king of england or draw off some of his forces a considerable sum of money and reinforcement of troops were sent into scotland and the king with the assent of his parliament assembled at perth engaged in the expedition edward having entertained doubts that during his absence a storm would be gathering on the brow of his known adversary dispatched messengers to the court of scotland to amuse by offers of a restitution of berwick on condition that the scotch would stand neuter in the conflicts between england and france but contrary to the opinion of many of his most skilful peers david rejected the proposed terms of amity and prepared to invade england he collected a powerful army consisting according to rapin of  0000 men other authors particularly froissart speed barnes and knighton greatly exaggerate the numbers with these in the beginning of october      david entered england by the western march showing tokens of a bloody and savage mind in his outset by putting the garrison of liddell tower to the sword and marking his progress through cumberland with wanton slaughter and desolation he advanced to the county of durham and approached the city the queen of england summoned the prelates and military tenants to attend her at york where measures were concerted for opposing the invaders and a body of troops amounting to about   000 men were assembled with all speed whilst david with his army lay at beaurepaire the associate lords encamped in auckland park douglas with a chosen troop reconnoitering the english was engaged near merrington his detachment was put to the rout and he escaped to the king with much peril rapin tells us the queen of england led the english forces to battle but that assertion is not supported by any cotemporary writer of credit david looked upon his adversaries as a raw and undisciplined army not able to stand against his hardy veterans and showed signs of great impatience before the troops engaged presuming that victory was certain and that the riches of the city were due to his plundering soldiers the english army was drawn up in four divisions lord henry percy commanded the first supported by the earl of angus the bishop of durham and several northern nobles the second body was led by the archbishop of york accompanied by the bishop of carlisle and the lords nevill and hastings the bishop of lincoln the lord mowbray and sir thomas rokesby led the third division and at the head of the fourth was edward baliol supported by the archbishop of canterbury the lord roos and the sheriff of northumberland each division consisted of four thousand men and the archers and men at arms were distributed through the whole corpse the author of the border history probably from his own conjecture for he quotes no authority alleges that besides the forces above named a strong and gallant party under the lords deincourt and ogle guarded queen philippa who in the morning before the battle having rode along the ranks and exhorted every man to do his duty to maintain the honor of his king and country and take revenge upon their barbarous invaders recommended her people to the protection of god and retired to a small distance from the place of action the scotch army was drawn out in three divisions the first was led by the high steward of scotland and the earl of march the earl of murray and lord douglas commanded the second and the third consisting of choice troops in which were incorporated the flower of the scottish nobility and gentry sustained by the french auxiliaries was commanded by the king in person with much heroic ardour the scotch king ordered the trumpets to sound the charge the high steward who led the van being sore galled by the english archers rushed on with such impetuous fury that he threw them into confusion and drove them back on lord henry percys division and the scotch pushing on vigorously with their broad swords and battle axes broke them so much that if relief had not instantly been sent them they would have been put to the rout but baliol rushing in with a body of horse threw the scotch battalion into confusion and gave the english time to rally and regain their ground whilst the high steward was obliged to retreat and reform his distracted array in this maneuver he is said to have shown great generalship performing the evolutions in a masterly manner and with little loss baliol with equal skill gave his troops breath made no pursuit and when least suspected rapidly charged the kings division in flank whilst they fought man to man in front unrelieved and distressed with this complicated battle the king fought desperately repeatedly bringing back his flying troops to the charge encouraging them by his example his exhortations and prayers ashamed to desert their prince in such jeopardy a brave phalanx threw themselves around him and fought till their numbers were reduced to little more than eighty in this desperate state and bleeding with many wounds david scorned to ask for quarter hoping he should still be relieved at length resistance was vain a tumultuous multitude with shouts of victory rushed upon him and he at length was made prisoner to john copeland a northumbrian esquire the division under douglas and murray struck with a panic at the fate of the royal legion and overpowered with numbers were soon broken and routed murray died on the field and douglas was made prisoner and few of the inferior officers escaped the sword the scotch king though he had two spears hanging in his body his leg desperately wounded and being disarmed his sword having been beat out of his hand disdained captivity and provoked the english by opprobious language to kill him when john copeland who was governor of roxborough castle advised him to yield he struck him on the face with his gauntlet so fiercely that he knocked out two of his teeth copeland conveyed him out of the field as his prisoner upon copelands refusing to deliver him up his royal captive to the queen who stayed at newcastle during the battle the king sent for him to calais where he excused his refusal so handsomely that the king sent him back a reward of  00l a year in lands where he himself should choose it near his own dwelling and made him a knight banneret rymers foed tom v p      froisart l   p   0  rapin p      this battle was fought on the   th of october      and lasted only three hours beginning at nine in the morning the victory being declared by sound of trumpet at noon the loss of the enemy was estimated at   000 the chief of whom were the earls of murray and strathern the lord constable david hay the lord marshal edward keith together with the lords chancellors and chamberlain of scotland the lords philip meldrum john stewart and alan stewart his brother sir alexander bothwell the kings standard bearer sir alexander ramsay and others of high rank among the prisoners were the earls of fife sutherland monteith carrick and wigton the lord douglas the bishops of st andrew and aberdeen james douglas sir malcolm fleming with many men of distinction historians have not mentioned what particular loss was sustained on the part of the english knighton tells us of four knights and five esquires only who fell in the field and dugdale says the lord hastings was mortally wounded but in so bloody a battle it is impossible but many men of distinction would fall in the english army  the ground where this battle was fought is hilly and in many parts very steep toward the river so that it is not possible to conceive how such an armament could be arranged and engage in any order the account given of this battle and of the subsequent transactions of the convent by the writers of that house as published by davies and contained in sir john lawsons mss and mr hoggs roll is to the effect given in the notes in the night before the battle of durham there appeared to john fossour then prior of the abbey of durham a vision commanding him to take the holy corporax cloth wherewith st cuthbert covered the chalice when he used to say mass and to put the same upon a spear point and next morning to repair to a place on the west of the city of durham called the red hills and there to remain till the end of the battle  the prior and monks accompanied with ralph lord nevil and john nevil his son lord percy and many other nobles returned to the abbey church there joining in prayer and thanksgiving to god and holy st cuthbert for the conquest obtained that day in which battle a holy cross taken out of holy rood house in scotland by king david bruce was taken from the said king which cross is recorded by ancient and credible writers to have come to the said king most miraculously being hunting the heart in a forest near edinburgh upon holy rood day in the place where this miracle was wrought now springs a fountain called the rood well the night after he was warned in his sleep to build an abbey in the same place  many excellent jewels and monuments brought from scotland and noblemens banners were offered to the shrine of st cuthbert together with the black rood of scotland  the banner cloth was a yard broad and five quarters deep the bottom was indented in five parts and fringed and made fast all about with red silk and gold it was made of red velvet on both sides embroidered with flowers of green silk and gold and in the midst was the said corporax cloth enclosed covered over with white velvet half a yard square every way having a cross of red velvet on both sides being fringed about the edge and skirts with red silk and gold and three fine little silver bells fastened to the skirts of the said banner cloth like unto sacring bells  on the west side of the city of durham where two roads pass each other a most famous and elegant cross of stone work was erected to the honor of god for the victory there obtained known by the name of nevils cross and built at the sole cost of lord ralph nevil which cross had seven steps about it every way squared to the socket wherein the stalk of the cross stood which socket was fastened to a large square stone the sole or bottom stone being of a great thickness viz a yard and a half every way this stone was the eighth step the stalk of the cross was in length three yards and a half up to the boss having eight sides all of one piece from the socket it was fixed into the boss above into which boss the stalk was deeply soldered with lead in the midst of the stalk in every second square was the nevils cross a saltire in a scutcheon being lord nevils arms finely cut and at every corner of the socket was a picture of one of the four evangelists finely set forth and carved the boss at the top of the stalk was an octangular stone finely cut and bordered and most curiously wrought and in every square of the nether side thereof was nevils cross in one square and the bulls head in the next so in the same reciprocal order about the boss on the top of the boss was a stalk of stone being a cross a little higher than the rest whereon was cut on both sides of the stalk of the said cross the picture of our savior christ crucified the picture of the blessed virgin on one side and of st john the evangelist on the other both standing on the top of the boss all which pictures were most artificially wrought together and finely carved out of one entire stone some parts thereof through carved work both on the east and west sides of the cross with a cover of stone likewise over their heads being all most finely and curiously wrought together out of the said hollow stone which cover of stone was covered over it remained till the year      when the same was broken down and defaced by some lewd and wicked persons    the hilloc called the maidens bower where st cuthberts banner was displayed whilst the monks put up their prayers to heaven within hearing of the noise and bustle of the conflict where the battle was truly with tumult and garments rolled in blood is yet to be seen in the depth of the valley by the hedges of shaw wood and likewise in the said red hills on the north side of nevils cross a little distant from a piece of ground called the flasse the maids bower used to be where the prior and monks stood making their prayers to god with the holy relic of st cuthbert during the said battle there was erected a beautiful cross of wood in remembrance of that holy relic carried to the battle  in the harleian collection no      is the following historical poem transcribed by mr jos ritson of grays inn and

the town and the improvement of land advances rapidly  at the distance of a quarter of a mile on an eminence toward the west are the remains of the great roman station which camden called longovicus dr gale in the philosophical transactions no     calls it the castra stativa where the soldiers were quartered in time of peace  glannibanta near lanchester map  mr horsley supposes horsleys britan romans p   0      mr camden was of opinion that lanchester was the roman longovicum and by what dr hunter has written to the royal society about it we have reason to rest in that conjecture for he says that several inscriptions have been dug up there and the roman street called watling street lies through it it is seated on the top of a hill and overlooked by another by the ruins we may discern it has been a much larger place in a square form and fortified with a thick strong stone wall about which now both within and without are nothing but ruins and rubbish it is probable that the buildings within the walls were all public viz temples palaces and stations for the soldiers and perhaps lodgings for the garrison no doubt this colony was adorned with many beautiful buildings the inscriptions found here since mr camdens time are as follows  n b they are all noted in the following extracts  when i was last there i looked at the pillars which had supported the floors of what is supposed to have been a balneum they were not all alike nor of a very regular figure but yet there was some similitude and proportion between them they are all about two feet and five inches high perhaps two roman feet and a half the angles or corners of four square stones rested on each of these pillars and between each two pillars was more than a yard distance upon the square stones had been a plaistering about four inches thick consisting of lime and small pieces of brick the marks of fire and smoke were very visible when they first discovered the place i was also informed that there was another set of pillars underneath which supported another such floor and some sort of metal upon it on which the upper set of pillars rested the lower pillars stood upon a blue clay and the intervals between them were filled up with earth and rubbish it was conjectured that the first had failed or been destroyed and that the second had been built on its ruins above this according to the account i had for there are no remains of it now was a square room having each side about four yards long and the walls plaistered in the same manner and with the same materials as the floor the altar hereafter described was found at the east end of this room with its back undressed toward the wall i have been more particular in this description because it has not been sufficiently given before but the other remains and monuments here i shall also largely describe  there is a very considerable tumulus about a mile from lanchester called the maiden law and probably the military way has not been far from this tumulus  no   plate imperator caesar marcus antonius gordianus pius felix augustus balneum cum basilica a solo instruxit per gneium lucilianum legatum augustalem propraetorem curante marco aurelio quirino praefecto cobortis primae legionis gordianae  this and the next are two curious and useful inscriptions which with most of the following were made public in the philosophical transactions no         from dr hunter and have most of them been inserted in camden the originals are now in the library at durham mr gale thinks that the legio here called gordiana was the legio sexta victrix which continued so long in the north and had its stated quarters at york whilst the other legions had theirs at a much greater distance yet we have an inscription at this very place by the leg xxvv which was employed not far from hence in building or repairing some structure as appears from the inscription at whitley castle in northumberland these inscriptions are valuable as they have preserved to us the names of two propraetors which otherwise must have been lost for as mr gale observes from virius lupus who was propraetor under severus in the year  0  to nonnius phillippus whom he believes to have succeeded the latter of these here mentioned to the year     the name of no other propraetor or legate is any where else to be met with it is highly probable that the two here mentioned immediately succeed one another because both inscriptions were erected not only under the same emperor but under the same commander of the cohort aurelius quirinus who had the care of both these works this as dr hunter informs us was found about one hundred yards cast of the fort the other within the sort which confirms mr gales opinion that the soldiers lodged within the sort the basaliacae of the ancients were public buildings in which causes were heard and merchants met for business they were adorned with pillars and covered walks vitruvius has given a description of them and so has palladio from him this stone is broke through the middle and some of the letters are damaged or lost but it is easy to supply them and this inscription seems rather to be worse cut and to be the later of the two as for the pre for per and gn for gneium in the fourth line it would be easy to produce other parallel instances as also of l for legionis but mr ward is inclined to think that pre at the beginning of the fourth line was not designed for per and that the following word should not be read gneium but egnatium a name that frequently occurs in gruter his reason for reading it thus is that in all such mixtures of smaller letters against the middle of larger in the same word the word always begins with a letter of the larger size and as for the e he imagines it was not intended to serve both words by being read twice because in such cases which are very rare the letter to be repeated is always found in a complex character he supposes therefore that there has either been a small e between pr which is now defaced or that it was designed to be put there but was forgot as it easily might be  horsley no    p      the reader will refer to a learned treatise on this

and another in northumberland that little more need be added here it may not be amiss to observe that the emperors name is here at length antonius as it is printed also in the fasti consulares we have likewise some other instances of it in montsaucon mr gale says that the armamentaria signify the arsenal and principia the quarters either of the legionary soldiers called the principes or the place where the ensigns are kept but from a passage in tacitus one would rather conclude the latter to be the generals pavilion  see gordons itin add p    and horsley no    p   0  n b maecilium in the

legions and cohorts in the face of some work they were building the last letter has frequently been mistaken for a t but in the original it is evidently an i with the usual numeral stroke above it and so can be nothing else but cohors prima  horsley no    p   0    fortunae augusti sacrum publius aelius atticus praefectus votum solvit libens merito  i know not what cohort publius aelius atticus commanded who erected this altar the word praefectus without any thing following is not uncommon in inscriptions the person where i lodged at lanchester told me that this altar was found at the east end of a square room which they discovered within the station and the back of the altar is undressed i know not whether or no the figure between the two leaves in the capital can be designed for the sun  horsley no    p   0  mr horsleys correspondent had furnished him with a very inaccurate drawing the cut was made from the original in the dean and chapters library in april      the radiations mr

cohortis secundae lingonum votum libens posuit merito  this stone looks like a pedestal and seems by its regular square cavity at the top to have had something fixed upon it but it is nothing like the base of an altar the letters are tolerably well cut i at first was doubtful if the first line might have been genio praetoris but upon examining the original i saw every letter very plain and was convinced that there neither was nor ever had been an s at the end i then thought it might be a flattering compliment to the unnamed praetor as if he was their genius or tutelar god but my learned friend mr ward judges this too high a compliment to be paid by a tribune to a praetor and observes that genius is a proper name frequent in gruter it is therefore my present opinion that this stone has sustained some pillar or somewhat of that nature and that the monument has been erected to the honor of genius the praetor if we read votum posuit the word votum must by a trope be taken here for the thing vowed as upon another inscription we have memoriam posuit for monumentum and upon another votum fecit which expression in the common sense is not to pay a vow but to make it and thus virgil seems to have used the word votum when he says lustramurque jovi votisque incendimus aras aen   xi     and likewise petronius in the following passage  stipant graves equi recessus danai et in voto latent satyr cap    where the same thing is twice repeated in different words and both equi and voto denote the wooden horse which the greeks pretended to consecrate to pallas votum pro redditu simulant this compliment is paid by claudius epaphroditus claudianus the tribune of the  st or  d cohort of the lingones the  d cohort of these people was in britain as appears from other inscriptions and in camden a smaller i is set before the other in this inscription so as to make it plainly the second there is i think room for it on the stone but the part where it should be is broken or worn  horsley no    p   0  marti d avg d avfidi us avfi dianvs the judicious antiquary dr hunter of durham was so obliging as to send me the copy of the inscription in the margin which i sound to be very exact when i compared it with the original the doctor supposes it has been affixed to the face of an altar and that the holes in the first line have been for this purpose the plate is of gold but very thin weighing just two guineas and the letters which are very peculiar are raised by an impression made on the inner side by some proper instrument the plate is so thin that in some places it is struck quite through with the too that has been used for raising the letters it may be questioned whether we are to read marti augsto and suppose the emperor to be represented as it were under the image or notion of the god of war or marti augusti and to suppose the emperor to be the favorite of mars or mars to be the emperors favorite deity but as to this matter i shall only refer to what has already been said in a parallel case in cumberland the cut of the letters particularly the g looks like the lower empire but i know no evidence whereby the particular emperor can be determined with any great probability we have several other altars at this place inscribed also to mars which have been taken notice of before i have only to add that according to dr hunters account in his letter to me this plate was found in the year      in a heap of rubbish cast out to clear an old foundation without the fortification of the garrison a little south from the balneum it is now in the chapter

supported by two rude pillasters  horsley no  0 p      no    pl this small altar with the boar on the side and the inscription much effaced is also ranked among these lanchester inscriptions mr ward supposes this altar might be erected to the god vitires and that the letters vit were upon the first line as we find them before the second line is plainly votum and the remaining letters upon the third line he thinks may be part of solvit this conjecture is favored by another inscription of this county upon an altar dedicated to this deity which has a boar upon one side but i think it more likely that the latter part of the inscription has been the name of the person erecting the altar the last letters are obscure and doubtful  besides these before mentioned which are not at durham there are some curiosities remaining yet in the station or town and among the rest a large stone almost like a mortar what use it has been for is hard to determine some of the people call it a font others who are more skilled think it has been designed to hold water for the roman lustrations  horsley no    p      no    plate deo marti aci   this small altar was in a stone wall enclosing a field called broomlawe near the station belonging to mr rowland wilkinson but i have now got it into my own possession the inscription has suffered very much by the weather the remains of it look like deo marti but it cannot now inform us by whom it was consecrated though the last visible letters look like acilius a common roman name and which i think occurs in another of our inscriptions  horsley no    p      no    plate   the capital of this altar and a small part of the inscription is broken off and lost and the want of it occasions some difficulty as to the reading when i first saw this stone it was built up in the wall of an enclosure i viewed it several times in this situation but then nothing appearing but the imperfect greek inscription the opposite part of the stone being entirely under cover and built up within the wall at first view i concluded it to be greek but could discover no satisfactory reading when i had purchased the stone and got it into my own possession i was much surprised to see a latin inscription on the opposite part of the altar which is the face and which the back of this altar or whether like janus bifrous it was designed to be double faced i shall not pretend to determine however to have inscriptions both before and behind is a singular curiosity of which i remember no parallel instance in britain unless the beautiful altar in camberland be taken for such but to have two such inscriptions in two different languages is yet more remarkable some suspect the greek inscription not to be genuine or that it has been added by a different hand and at a different time from the latin but i see no just reason to entertain this suspicion because i cannot discern by whom or with what view it could have been added so little was this altar regarded or valued that according to the usual fate of such monuments it was used as a common stone in the wall  the high prices of curious roman coins have produced a great many forgeries contrived very artfully but the little regard that has been had for monuments of stone renders us more secure of their being altogether genuine but to return from this digression the sight of the latin inscription enabled me to read the remains of the greek one i humbly think with great probability for i take the greatest part of the one to be much the same with the other excepting the different language and character i shall therefore speak to the latin inscription as being more easy and perfect  horsley no    p      no    plate aesculapio titus flavius titianus tribunus votum solvit libentissime merito  it appears plainly from this that the altar has been erected by one titus flavius titianus a tribune but no cohort is mentioned which he commanded there are several consuls of the name titianus but the other name are different from that of our tribune tiberius fabius titianus appears five times in the fasti and at such a distance of time as to make it probable they were five different persons this made me suspicious that the t in our inscriptions was to be read tiberius and that the following name might be fabius but the fl are so distinct on the stone as to leave no room for a doubt i find postumius titianus was consul in the year  0  in the time of diocletian and maximian and almeloveen conjectures that this may be the same with one who is called in gruter t fl postumius titianus this comes nearest the names of our tribune but there is no arguing from hence with any probability that these two titiani lived at or near the same time but thus much for the person erecting this altar the principal question is to whom it has been inscribed we have little to guide us in this but the letters pio at the top which are certain and distinct i thought of antoninus pius and other emperors to whom living or dead and deified this epithet pius has been applied such as divo constantio pio and others baron clerk was so obliging as to send me several conjectures about this latin inscription a copy of which i transmitted to him among other things this very learned antiquary supposes that pio may be a part of aesculapio this conjecture is more agreeable and satisfactory than any thing that has occurred to myself or been offered by any other i think by the proportion of the altar that there is not above one line of the inscription wanting which might be filled up with aescula or with deo aescula  as for the greek inscription i believe it has stood thus when entire   pro salute titus flavius titianus trib votum solvit libentissime merito    i observe that there are five lines in the greek inscription and but four remaining in the latin and that the stone is rather higher on the side of the greek inscription than the other this induces me to think that the imperfect remains at the top have been a part of the first line of this inscription i need say nothing to show how suitable this reading is to the remains on the stone and to the latin inscription on the other side both the one and the other i think appear at first sight that there were some here in this part of the island who were willing to pay regard to the gods who presided over health and recovery appears from the sculpture at risingham in northumberland  is the greek word that generally corresponds to tribunus in latin in the new testament  is rendered tribunus and  cohors by several this is the second instance of the greek character used in such inscriptions in britain the other is the famous altar at corbridge no doubt they have been erected by some auxiliaries which came from greece or the neighborhood of it such as the thracians etc some cohorts of which were in britain  hor no    p      the letter from sir john clerk to mr horsley we find noted in one from him to roger gale esquire in

consecraneorum equitum v s i m  when i first saw this stone it was in the corner of a close belonging to nicholas greenwell not far from the former the upper part was broken off and built up in the wall and the inscription covered but upon removing it out of the wall and comparing the two parts together i perceived they had been originally united i have since this got both the pieces into my possession and so have had an opportunity of placing them one upon another when this was done they tallied with so much exactness as to render it absolutely certain that they have originally made up one and the same altar this altar is inscribed to jupiter optimus maximus and has been erected as i take by the vexillation of an equestrian cohort of the varduli cranei people of spain the first word in the second line must i think have been vexillatio and the o perhaps has been a little one and added near the top of the i as we sometimes find it i once thought i discerned it there but own myself jealous that my imagination assisted my eye sight the next word is plainly cohors but who the people have been of which this cohort consisted must be more distinctly considered when i first viewed the two pieces as they lay separate i read the name vardiorum these are a people of dalmatia mentioned with some variation of the name by strabo pliny and ptolomy but since i got them home and put them together i have found that by the largeness of the interval there must have been two letters between the d and o in the third line i have also discovered the sure remains of a v after the d besides the imperfect letter before the o i make no doubt therefore but the name is vardulorum the two first letters in the fourth line of which there are any remains seem plainly to have been cr which i would have concluded to have been the initial letters of the name cranei and to have been read vardulorum craneorum or e craneorum if my first conjecture concerning craneis in the richester inscription could have been supported but that being rejected i am more at a loss for any probable reading of this part of the inscription now before us i would gladly still make use of the one as a key to the other and therefore if consecraneis be read in the former i am most inclined to suppose cr to be some part of an abbreviation of the same word in this possibly it has been cscr which supply seems not unsuitable to the vacant space on the stone and perhaps et has been at the end of the preceding line in letters of the same size thus it would be fardulorum et consecraneorum in this as vardulorum cum consecraneis in the other eq in this fourth line is no doubt for equestris or equitum the character at the end of this line is much the same with an m that is used for mill in one of the inscriptions of glasgow but that it here signifies  000 horse is more than i dare venture to affirm we have aa and cohors milliaria and millenaria in vegetius and the notitia goltzius in his thesaurus has also cohors millenaria titianus in the preceding inscription is styled  possibly this might be the millenary cohort which he commanded  horsley no    p      no    plate at first view

lie pretty much out of the way i have found out by the help of another late and lucky discovery i mean a stone found not long ago at richester  for this vide view of northumberland the varduli crarei though this latter name be usually wrote with a g at the beginning are two neighboring people in spain etc   extract from mr gales answer as for the om they can have been nothing but the remains of jovi optimo maximo and perhaps what follows is the remains of vexillatio though i am not without my scruples as to that in the first place i do not remember i ever met with such an expression as vexillatio cohortis or cohortium though frequently with a vexillatio legionis which i take to imply a detachment sent off from the legion under a vexillum where we meet with those vexiliationes leg ii vi xx upon the wall in scotland secondly vexili equitum is generally taken for cohors equitum but as there might be a detachment upon occasion as well from a legion i will not insist upon that vardulorum is very plain upon this altar though a name hitherto unknown in britain i wish the craneorum was as much out of dispute for the cr that follow vardi are the initials of that word yet i cannot think they belong to vardulorum as you read them because we find but one nation of the varduli in spain and consequently no occasion for the addtional cra to distinguish them from any other of their neighbors that might have the same appellation pomponius mela expressly calls the varduli gens una as for the cranei upon the richester stone i shall show you plainly by and by that it is quite another thing to this i am obliged to add that i cannot find among my old geographers such a people as the cranei or granei in spain or any where else therefore should be glad to know where you met with them in the richester inscription etc the cum con  i read with the beginning of the seventh line cum consecraneis a word not very common but you have it in julius capitolinuss life of gordian c

from mr horsley on the same subject dated   jan    0  i confess your letter has shocked my assurance though i still hope my conjecture will not be quite overthrown gravij graij or granij as i think it is sometimes written are people not far from the varduli mentioned by pliny and others these were the people i meant and thought of the change from granei to cranei is very easy the word consecranei no where occurs in inscriptions and no evidence of its being used till after the time of this inscription but i only send this to beg excuse for the delay till i return home when i shall examine the riechester stone   mr gale in his letter from london dated    jan shows the improbability of the people mentioned by mr horsley being expressed in the foregoing inscriptions the letter is long and might not be esteemed sufficiently pertinent to have a place here  w h  extract of a letter from dr hunter of durham to roger gale esquire dated    may      i have had the happiness to meet with these

menosca vesperies amanum portus ubi nunc flaviobriga colonia where mr hardoiun recites the modern names and as gruters almost infinite collection affords no inscription where the varduli are named i presume the roman economy under the emperor trajan by descent a spaniard if not sooner had abolished the old distinctions of separate governments and reduced the whole province under one general name hispania which afterward the notitia imperij occidentalis divides into three consular provinces under the direction of four presidents viz farraconenis carthagineus tingitania insula balearium and places no garrison of the varduli in any fortress in the eastern or western empire  the inscription upon the first is cut very fair in comparing my copy with mr horsleys altar no    durham belonging

side the same as one of the three mentioned by mr horsley in our library   answer to the preceding letter by r gale esquire dated london   june      as for the two inscriptions you sent me i will venture to give my thoughts upon them etc the first of them is very curious as it gives us the name of a legatus augustalis and propraetor hitherto unknown in britain and which ought as i think to be read as follows numini augusti and genio cohortis secundae vordulorum equitate milliariae sub antistio advento legato augusti propraetore f tiranus tribunus dat dedicatque rite to read gr in the fourth line gregalium is not a little doubtful it cannot well be supposed that the tribune of the cohort would dedicate an altar to the deity of the emperor and at the same time to the genius of the common soldiers exclusive of the genius of the officers of which he himself was one and how to read it otherwise is as uncertain if the letters are gr as in your copy but if they are cr as on the altar given us by mr horsley durham no    in his brit romans and which you say has c very apparent instead of g they may denote civium romanorum and those varduli people of spain and admitted to the freedom of the city of rome for some extraordinary merit or by some emperors savor perhaps their countryman trajans this was a privilege frequently conferred upon foreigners even whole towns and nations and at last communicated by antoninus pius omnibus in commune subjectis by which it seems as if this altar had been erected before this general grant of that emperor for it is no great honor or advantage for these varduli to value themselves upon if they had enjoyed it only in common with all the rest of the world mons spanheim observes exercit prima ad constitution imp antonini de civ romans quod sub m antonino imp civitate donati essent quicunque in romani orbis provinciis aut oppidis delecti essent milites ut praesidarij in imperij limitibus constituerentur this seems contradictory to the first mentioned grant since it only confers the freedom of the city upon the soldiers in garrison on the frontiers of the empire and the other gives it to all the subjects of the roman empire without exception perhaps the soldiers had this advantage given them at first and upon finding the encouragement it gave them to defend the countries where they were quartered it was thought advisable to admit all the subjects of the empire to the same privilege to interest them the more in preserving the whole from the attacks of the barbarians but there has been no small uncertainty among the learned to which of the antonins this constitution is owing some attributing it to antoninus pius others to marcus aurelius and mr spanheim with great reason to antoninus caracalla from dion cassius chiefly who tells us this privilege was granted to him omnibus qui in urbe romano erant not so much for the honor and advantage of it to the people as for the filling his treasury since it made them liable to the payment of several taxes from which they were before exempted so that the soldiers had this benefit conferred on them for their services and the rest of the people afterward most likely to drain their purses in gruters thesaur p       is mentioned tantistius praefectus alae sulpiciae c r i e civium romanorum and in p       l praesentius praefectus cob   afr c r e which is read praefectus cohortis primae afrorum civium romanorum equitate just the same as this at langchester only changing afrorum into vardulorum  a cohors equitata was composed partly of horse partly of foot as vegetius informs us lib ii cha   prima cohors habet pedites mill centum and quinque equites loricatos centum triginta duos et appellantur milliaria i must own the cohors in this inscription is called secunda vardulorum of which an inscription was found at riechester in northumberland  see horsleys brit romans north    this second cohors of the varduli might however be the prima auxiliaria of some legion perhaps the sixth and in more esteem for some eminent service or fortunate accident than the first not dignified with the honorable title and privileges civium romanorum perhaps also independent of any legion and after all the sole reason why one of the cohorts was called the first and the other the second might have been from the priority of time when they were first raised this antistius adventus seems also to have been legatus augusti and propraetor in belgium from an altar found near utrecht where he is called caius antistius vid reinesiis syntagm ius class i    jovi opt maximo summano ex superamissimo soli invicto appoltini lunae dianae fortunae marti victoriae pci caius antistius adventus legatus augusti propraetore dat and this justifies my ing of his titles here legatus augusti propraetore and not legionis augustae propraetore there being no mention of a military body in the belgiae inscription besides we never meet with a legion styled august singly without some other adjunctive distinction as the legio ii vi or antoniana augusta nor could there be any such officer as a praetor or propraetore legionis that magistrate being entirely civil the r in the last line denotes as i think rite and not reverenter a word not used by the ancients for this purpose upon any altars or antique monuments  the l a in the last line of the other inscription i believe stands for lubenti animo and not for libertus augusti there being nothing in it leading us to such a person there is nothing else in it of curiosity to be satisfied or difficulty to be cleared   extract of a letter from sir john clerk touching the above dated from pennycuik    june      there were many barbarities in the language of the lower empire and therefore it is hard to determine with any certainty about letters i cannot approve of the doctors gregalium though i believe he would be vastly sond of it and pleased with the invention your civium romanorum is certainly right if the letters be not g r for germanicorum for i have seen if i remember right some such inscription though i cannot tell where you will be surprised at my notion of germanicorum if i do not explain to you the reading of the altar so as to comprehend such a word if the letters are g r in the sense i take them the reading must relate to the cohors milliaria it is hard to conceive how cohors milliaria germanicorum should dedicate an altar genio cob ii vardulorum besides if it was so the reading upon the altar would have been cohors mill german and not germ cob mill  r g  as dedicating an altar to the genius of the cohors vardulorum upon some signal service done f must be fecit and the last letter r restituit etc etc    this must have been the figure of the goddess fortune seated the wheel that is by her side and the cornucopia she has in her left hand and the globe at her foot on the other side do all show it to be fortune though one of her arms as well as her head be now broken off there are several altars at durham inscribed to fortune one found at lanchester inscribed fortunae augusti perhaps this has been the image of that fortune and by this image with the globe at her feet may be expressed the emperors universal dominion the modern letters that are now cut on the base may easily at first view deceive one into an opinion that the image is not roman or antique but this only shows when it was found and by whom namely in the year   00 by henry ornsby of lanchester whose wifes name was elizabeth to disguise this figure further there stands on it a mercurys head as is plain from the petasus so that i look upon it as certain that the head and body have belonged to different figures though now the one is generally set upon the other  this image of fortune i take to be the same with a figure in mr gordon which i can find no where explained he has made the proportion far too large for the rest of the figures and possibly had forgot the dimensions   this figure about twentyfour inches in height remains in the dean and chapters library at durham and the proper head is to be seen there the sculpture is uncommonly good and we prefer cutting the representation from a drawing made in      to a mere imitation of mr horsleys plate  this represents a curious sculpture which is on a stone built up in the vestry wall of the church it is much like that at netherby though there is some difference in the drapery and here is no corona on the head but only the hair plaited i believe this to be a genius as well as the other or at least the emperor represented as such   the first name of this town has been glanchester composed as usual of the first syllable of the old roman name with the word chester annexed to it the g for the sake of an easier pronunciation might be dropped if glanoventa signifies a bank or hill near a river ven or vent in the british tongue signifying a river the situation of the station at lanchester is not unsuitable to this etymology for it stands on high ground with a river on one side and a rivulet on the other and not far from either i know two of our greatest modern antiquaries roger gale esquire and dr hunter of durham suppose lanchester to be the ancient longovicus the affinity of name having as i presume inclined them to this opinion but i have a pretty strong reason to offer why this cannot be the longovicus in the notitia garrisoned by the numerus longovicariorum which is this it is evident that some order is observed in the notitia in setting down the several places and longovicus is set among the most southerly that were under the dux britanniarum it is put down as more to the south than lavatrae or verterae and next to derventio all which are mentioned in the notitia as well as the itinerary and this suits much better with the situation of lancaster in lancashire than lanchester in the county of durham and as none of the military ways on which any of the itinera proceed seem to have passed by lanchester so this may be a good reason why longovicus is not mentioned in the itinerary though we have it in the notitia upon the whole therefore i see no place bids so fair to be the glanoventa in the itinerary as lanchester especially if we consider how the rest of the iter goes on when this foundation is laid  the station and town have been situated on a lingula between the river browney and the rivulet smallup this rivulet runs into the browney a little below the station and browney loses itself and name in the river were at sunderland bridge two miles south of durham the station is two furlongs distant from smallup and not so much from browney it has a high situation and yet the prospect is bounded quite round about with hills or rising grounds that are not at a very great distance the same sort of situation is observable at elsdon in northumberland and several other places this situation has this advantage that an enemy could not come over these rising grounds but they must immediately appear to the garrison  mr horsley has delineated this station of an exact square figure whereas it is oblong one hundred and seventyfour paces from north to south and from east to west one hundred and sixty within the wall it had survived many ages less mutilated than any structure of the kind in the northern counties but of late many of the stones have been removed to enclose the adjacent lands and make the roads and the proprietor is regularly destroying this piece of antiquity in some parts the wall yet remains almost perfect the outside is perpendicular twelve feet in height built of ashler work in regular courses each stone being about nine inches deep and twelve long by some large stones which lie near the foot of the wall it is evident there was a parapet with a walk near three feet wide at the top at the west entrance a stone as represented in the cut was lately dug up from which the drawing was made in      and shows that such fortifications had more ornament than is commonly apprehended the inside of the vallum is built of ashler work but from the ground work upwards at the distance of about twenty inches it diminishes gradually in thickness in steps running parallel through the whole structure by which those within might ascend the wall and instantly line the parapet with troops on the approach of an enemy the wall where broken through is eight feet thick at the present surface diminishing to somewhat more than four at the top the interior part between the facings is formed of thin stones placed inclining featherwise tier above tier run full of mortar mixed with rough gravel what is remarkable there appear no throughs as the masons call those stones which bind the buildings by going through from face to face or into the heart of the wall there was an entrance in the center of each side of the square and to the west a wide ditch the ground has been cultivated many years on the other sides as well as within the vallum we did not discern any inscription on the walls save l xxxv mr greenwell of the ford has preserved in his garden wall several rude effigies lately found here the most remarkable are represented in the cuts  the cup used at divine offices in the church has a cover which was found in this station the date on it      is presumed to be the time of finding it is a roman patera and is also represented in the cut  the last time we visited this station in august      we discovered at a gate on the west side of the road the pillar represented which it is presumed stood on the watlingstreet it is now fixed as a gate post and is inscribed as we apprehend to marcus antonius gordianus the f in the last line has been compound to make the word felici  an extensive division of common lands within this parish took place by virtue of an act of parliament in the twelfth year of his present majesty on which it was computed twenty thousand acres were to be enclosed the commissioners were empowered to dispose of lands to raise money for making all the roads and paying expenses for which purpose they sold one thousand five hundred and fiftyone acres for     l or thereabouts and three hundred acres were set out and vested in the justices of the peace of the county for raising money to compensate the owners of allotments such damages as they should sustain by the lord bishop of durham or his lessees winning mines therein but being afterward considered that it would be more expedient to sell an allotment of three hundred acres subject to a rent charge of  0l a year an act of parliament was obtained to carry such sale into effect and thomas white of retford in the county of nottingham esquire became the purchaser he set a most laudable example on this division and planted two hundred and eleven acres with forest trees and sixteen acres with fruit trees which under the shelter of rising plantations promise to answer the adventurers expectations of the three hundred acres purchased mr white has planted one hundred and fifty acres more with forest trees this vast tract of country which was barren desert and dreary where the perplexed traveller

have died possessed thereof by the name of maneria and villa de langley and le waterfall cum ptin que huit ex feoffo rici de scrop chiv we do not find langley mentioned in any succeeding inquisition

john his son and heir who was grandfather of henry after mentioned and probably the confidence reposed consisted of diverse limitations in tail by virtue of which it descended to henry lord scrope the feoffors grandson who by the inscription after mentioned is presumed to have built the hall of which the present ruins are remains an engraving of this inscription was published in the antiquarian

lanchester is a mantlepiece of stone over a large fire place with an inscription thereon in capital letters the inscription relates to henry lord scrope of bolton in yorkshire who married margaret the daughter of thomas lord dacre of gilsland in cumberland the arms on the second quarter are those of tibetot or tiptoft an heiress of which family married an ancestor of the said henry lord scrope whose coat of arms are engraved with hers and the same are depicted in the upper windows on the south part of the parish church of richmond in yorkshire the escutcheon by the division on the wifes side on the right hand looks as if intended for him and his two wives for he was twice married but the arms on the side of the wives are so worn away that they are not distinguishable the uppermost seems as if something like bars or barry were in them bars were in the arms of greystock the other should be scrope of upsal his second wife whose name was alice daughter of thomas lord scrope of

broken in the center and stands thus so far as the letters are distinct henricus scrope mil xi dominvs de bolto   et vxor eivs fili   dacr et graistoke by this it appears he was the eleventh lord of

find more at large the particulars here briefly recapitulated bishop eardulph who was the eighteenth prelate of the church of lindisfarn flying with the remains of st cuthbert before the barbarians who made their sacrilegious descent on that island not settling at crake where he sat down for a time rested at chester and there began to build a church about the year     and the religious body retained this residence till the year     when they rested at durham tanner says the sea removed hither had probably a chapter of monks or rather secular canons attending it  chester entertained the same religious society that existed at lindisfarn and they were again translated to durham so it is pretty certain there was no establishment of monks here but of seculars egelric the fourth bishop of chester was induced to take down the humble building of wood which his predecessor erected for his episcopal church and raised one more magnificent finding great treasures he conveyed the same out of his bishopric to enrich the monastery of peterborough from whence he came we have already offered conjectures on this treasuretrove and therefore shall not dwell on it here on the introduction of canons regular into the cathedral church of durham chester it is said was one of the churches appointed to receive the seculars who without having committed offense were removed from the seat of dignity and no doubt were provided for in the most ample manner  the church of chester divested of its state and authority became merely a parochial rectory chester church dedicated to st mary and st

above the roof takes an octagonal form and in this part is apparently much more modern it is finished with a most elegant stone spire one of the finest in the north of england being in the whole one hundred and fiftysix feet in height the accurate plate will save much description the whole length of this building on the outside is fiftyfour paces the church within is of a regular form having two side ailes separated from the nave by five pointed arches supported on pillars two of which toward the east in each row are light and round but the third an odd conceit in the architect is formed of two cylinders put together the broad sides facing the nave and ailes the nave is in length from the foot of the tower thirty paces and in width including the ailes from the north door to the south fifteen paces the pulpit is placed against the center pillar in the south row the sounding board heavy with rude carving the whole church is decently stalled and kept clean the pavement is new there is a handsome white marble font and a gallery at the west end the south aile is lighted with three regular windows of three lights each under pointed arches in the eastern one are two coats of arms the chancel has been altered in modern times and is only six paces wide by eleven long the arch which separates it is supported on light brackets and the stalls are without much ornament there are four windows to the south and a large modernsash to the east  the north aile which now is solely appropriated to and filled with a line of tombs of the lumley family has anciently been further extended three arches and two columns appearing in the outside wall as if some small cloister formerly lay contiguous to the church the windows discover the alteration which perhaps was made when the tombs were placed for there are three square windows within the old arches and a window under a pointed arch beyond them before before we speak of the monuments it must be noted that bishop matthew granted license in      authorizing john baron of lumley to translate hither the remains and monuments of his ancestors particularly of john lumley and ralph lumley from the yard of the cathedral church at durham where they were placed near the north door registr modern eccles dunelm matthew p     d and chapter lib   this solemn arrangement of effigies this aile of death cannot be visited without some emotion by those who know the family descended of an illustrious race of ancestry or have traced their history and possessions the genealogical table which attends the description of lumley castle will save a tedious rehearsal of monumental inscriptions  the first effigy at the foot or west end of the aile is by an inscription on the wall noted to appertain to liulphus that unhappy minister of walcher bishop of durham who provoked the massacre at gateshead church the figure is cut in stone but much mutilated having lost the feet the right hand is extended grasping the sword as in the action of drawing the weapon the legs are straight it will be necessary to note why such different attitudes had acceptance in monumental effigies persons who died in battle on the victorious side were represented with the helmet on the head the shield on the lest and the sword on the dexter side naked and with the point upwards those who died in battle on the vanquished side were represented on their tombs without their coat over their armor with their feet resting on a dead lion having their hands joined on their breast the visor lifted up and the sword in the sheath those who died prisoners were represented without helmet sword or spur one who had served a great part of his life in the army and afterward became a religious person was represented upwards in the

is ribd down the front and has two transverse slits for the sight the breast is covered with the shield bearing three parrots the sword under the shield unsheathed the point upwards rested against the face of the visor the legs are straight supported on a dog lying at rest this personage was a knight in the ninth year of king richard ii and in the retinue of henry de percy earl of northumberland in the expedition into scotland where he behaved so gallantly that the king in the year succeeding appointed him governor of berwick in the twelfth year of that reign he was taken prisoner by the scotch after his release he held berwick as the earls deputy for some time was summoned to parliament among the barons from the eighth year of king richard ii till the first of king henry iv inclusive when he was attainted and had his lands seized for being a confederate with the earl of kent and others against that accession and opposing the disposal of richard the associators appeared in arms and took possession of the town of cirencester whilst their troops lay encamped without but on an insurrection of the inhabitants the lords were overpowered and carried prisoners to the king at oxford where they suffered immediate execution it seems lord lumley was not among the prisoners for by the record of his forfeiture and attainder it is set forth he died in the field of battle if we give credit to the device on the monument when he fell he was of the victorious party his wife elianor was daughter of john lord nevill of raby and sister of ralph earl of westmoreland in her widowhood she had in the second year of king henry iv an assignment of twenty pounds a year during life out of the customs at hull which was confirmed by king henry v in the first year of his reign with the further grant

eastereve      to which the english army was betrayed by one andrew forgusa a lombard who was employed by the duke as a spy and falsely represented the numbers and situation of the enemy many of the english lords were averse to the enterprise and dissuaded the duke from approaching his foes on so slight and suspicious a report but the general implicitly placing confidence in his emissary resolved to seek the foe and engage his troops disdained the idea of deserting danger and when too late found they were attacking four times their numbers feats of distinguished bravery were displayed and all the efforts of intrepid courage exhibited but in vain for in the dreadful carnage of a defeat there sell the duke lord lumley the earls of tankerville and angus and the lord ross together with many of

vi but the issues and profits of the bailiwic were appropriated to the sheriffs proper benefit with all debts fines and amerciaments emoluments accruing from alienations intrusions wards marriages reliefs etc the intention of which appropriation was to reward their diligence in protecting the borders against the scots and for that purpose to keep sufficient guards in pay but that duty being lessened by the appointment of wardens of the marches in the third year of king edward vi it was enacted that the sheriffs of northumberland should thenceforth like others account to the exchequer in

says he found in an old book of pedigrees in the british museum as it is not one in the arrangement before mentioned in remembrance thereof we have given a cut of it we conceive that this is the monument of thomas the son and heir of sir john lumley whose effigy is the tenth in the arrangement and had been removed from its station in chester church for some cause not noted there  this ancient monument or statuarie broken and wasted nere the ruynes of the chapel in the first ward within the castle called barnards castle was at the honorable means and motion of john baron lumley sent by sir

has many good buildings in it and is commodiously situated for supplying the numerous miners employed in the neighboring collieries and other works at whitehill or whitwel in this neighborhood is a blast furnace which makes iron metal from iron stone dug out of pits in the neighboring fells these fells have been very much worked for iron stone supposed by the danes when they were in possession of this kingdom as appears from the great quantity of scoria or cinder which is found upon the fells and extends many miles westward the method in those times had been to melt the iron stone with charcoal in a large smithy hearth called a bloomery and then in another hearth to melt it down again and reduce it to bar iron for all manner of country uses and when the wood failed they removed their hearths to where was more plenty so that evidently they must have blown their bloomery bellows either by hand or with horses or have known the use of air furnaces as the most scoria or cinder is found upon the high grounds where no water could be obtained about three miles west of chester is a place called the old furnace where very lately was to be seen the bottom of a furnace hearth according to the usual method of building them now but of much smaller dimensions they had blown the bellows with a water wheel as appears by the cut of a water race to convey it to the wheel from an upper part of the burn on the opposite side of the burn is a place called the alum well from the water having a strong aluminous smell and taste the method of making metal is by putting into a large furnace about thirtyfour feet in height and twelve or thirteen feet wide in the broadest part but contracted at top and bottom a certain number of baskets of coal or cinders to a certain number of boxes of iron stone calcined for the purpose and a quantity of lime stone sufficient to slux it when a sufficient quantity is melted into the hearth or basin at the bottom of the furnace it then is tapped with an iron bar and run off into metal pigs or large vessels prepared in loam a composition of sand clay etc for different uses such as brewing vessels soap pans engine pumps cylinders cannons of all sizes and the iron stone and coal used here are allowed by the best judges at his majestys warren at woolwich to make the strongest and soundest cannons that are proved there  from the

there was a money payment instituted in lieu of some duties in that early period the pedigree of the noble family of lumley earl of scarborough vol   page    the family of lumley is undoubtedly of great antiquity and various are the traditions touching the original stem thereof which like most others of such long standing is so ingulphed in obscurity that no other light than conjecture is now to be had thereof the most probable besides the authority of so great men as camden and sir william dugdale is that this family is denominated from lumley on the banks of the river wear near chesterlestreet in the county durham where being seated they were thence surnamed as the manner of those ages was to style men from the places where they lived or were born and by the best records etc

 genealogy lumley castle view of lumley castle lumley castle  view of lumley castle the chief improvement of this country is attributed to cardinal langley who disforested the lands and licenced their being enclosed and brought into tillage  as this manor appertained to the bishop we must naturally conclude there were few free tenants therein in the fifth year of bishop hatfield will de birtley died seized of a message and thirty acres of land here held by homage fealty and fifteen shillings rent and ra clerk in the seventh year of the same prelate died seized of twentysix acres of land held by fealty and ten shillings rent and sixty acres of wood by fealty and rendering two arrows and they are the only free tenants we have met with noted in the ancient records  camden apprehended chester was the condercum of the romans dr stukeley in his iterboreale      says the hermen street is very plain being a straight line hither when we descend from gateshead fell i think bid mentions this station as called concester which retains part of the roman name great coal works too hereabouts the first wing of the astures made this their garrison as the notitia tells us being ad lineam valli for though it be not upon the wall it is reasonable to think his expression is not to be strictly taken it was convenient that some of the forces that guarded the wall should be quartered at some suitable distance that they might have room of country for their maintenance no inscriptions or other roman remains have been discovered here and the name of chesteronthestreet derived from its situation on the roman way has hitherto been all that led the antiquaries to conceive it was of roman origin it is probable as dr stukeley observes some troops were stationed at a distance from the wall perhaps they lined the great roads at intervals with small detachments and this is still more probable if we admit they knew any thing of pit coal for fuel but we defer speaking on that till we advance to the banks of tyne  for the sake of connection  lumley castle is the next place of observation this castle one of the seats of lord scarborough stands on a fine elevated situation ornamented with beautiful plantations the lands rise gradually from the channel of the river were on the south and west sides and on the north is the rivulet called lumley beck the east front of the castle stands immediately on the brink of a very deep valley full of wood through which the brook winds toward the were the form of this edifice is square having a projecting tower at each angle and a court or area in the center the corners of each tower are guarded with utresses crowned with a small turret or observatory what is singular in the turrets is that they are octangular so that they overhang the face of each square of the base and are machicolated or open for the purpose of annoying assailants by casting down stones etc which gives the edifice a singular appearance the castle is built of a yellow freestone which makes it look bright and beautiful at a distance the chief entrance is at the west front by a double slight of steps and a platform which fills the whole space between the tower the south front is modern and brought forward almost parallel with the tower sixtyfive paces in length the north front is obscured by offices and the east front retains its ancient form there is a gateway in the center of the east front which projects and is guarded by square turrets at the angles with observatories as before described above the gate is a gallery formed in the arch with apertures to annoy an enemy above this gate are six shields of arms boldly cut in stone with their several crests cotemporary with the building and which critically give us the date of it  the arrangement of the arms is as follows in the center and elevated above the rest are the arms of france and england quarterly being as we presume the arms of king richard ii as in that reign sir ralph lumley obtained license from bishop skirlaw dated      to castellate his house of lumley and the architecture of this front is a grand model of the taste of that age the act of richard ii mentioned by mr pennant had been intrusional or merely confirmatory it is said to have been built in the time of edward i by sir robert de lumley and enlarged by his son sir marmaduke prior to that the family residence was at lumley from whence it took the name a village a mile south of the castle where are remains of a very old hall house that boasts a greater antiquity the former was not properly castellated till the year      when sir ralph the first lord of lumley obtained from richard ii licentiam castrum suum de lomley do novo aedificandum muro de petra and calce batellare and kernellare

nevill with the bulls head for the crest the lowest arms on the dexter side are those of cowley crest a rams head on the sinister side the arms of hilton baron hilton and mosess head for the crest there are three stories of apartments in this front with mullioned windows guarded with iron between the walls and the brink of the precipice is just space enough for a terrace which in early times was guarded with a curtain wall the dell is very deep the banks are steep and now filled with large forest trees the uniformity of the east front the arrangement of the arms and the whole appearance of the masonry testify that this was part of the original structure and a chief entrance for should we form our conjecture from the appearance of the center area we should conclude every front of the castle was similar to this  many accounts and prints have been published of this beautiful place which strikes the eye of the traveller on the great northern road the most excellent of the prints was by hearne and byrne we will in the first place select from the various publications such matter as appears most worthy attention and then proceed with our view all that camden says of it is that it is enclosed with a park in russell and owens england displayed it is described to contain a great number of spacious apartments some antique and others modern the paintings are valuable many of them representing the ancestors of that noble family for some centuries past in the habits of the time the park besides the pleasantness of the situation has another and still more valuable circumstance to recommend it that of being full of veins of coal this together with a navigable river by which the coals are carried down to sunderland render lumley park an inexhaustable mine of treasure to the family in one of the monthly magazines we are informed by a paper signed edward barras that the park is walled round with hewn stone had formerly deer but after it was reduced and the pales removed they sickened and died and he adds there are several dates upon different parts of the castle one was pointed out to me on the inner side of one of the eastern turrets where the letters i l    0 appear though almost defaced much repair has been given to the inner walls of the area and on one of the eastern towers are two long strings of escutcheons cut in stone and placed in the building nine in each row with the arms of lumley in the center at the bottom and in two small shields at the top a fleurdelis on the dexter side and a rose on the sinister in those strings the lumley arms are impaled with the several families wherewith they intermarried  there is a tradition at chester that about a century ago the remains of an old chapel stood about three hundred yards to the northwest of the castle with several vaults and subterraneous passages a hill called chapel hill is well known but no one about the castle could give any information touching the buildings  from the platform at the entrance into the hall you command a beautiful prospect at the foot of the avenue which leads up to the castle is a fine basin of water with a salmon lock and fishermens cottage over which on the opposite rising grounds you view the town of chester the deanery house and church at a pleasing distance the more extended landscape comprehends the great northern road animated with passengers the

and whose good nature and generosity endeared him to all his acquaintance he was earnest in promoting the good of his country and particularly that great support of it its trade in the cause of which he embarked his fortune and applied a most laudable industry manifesting in his affairs an uncommon elegance and propriety and as his life was adorned with every virtue that dignifies human nature so his death is universally a most melancholy occasion of sorrow    the village of pelton and other striking objects and the back scene consists of broken and irregular grounds every where scattered over with cottages a cultivated scene fills the view to the left in a variety of situations you see the winding streams of the were on the one hand the town of great lumley on the other walridge and the hermitage with many hamlets in the vale whilst the distant landscape is terminated by plawsworth and the plantations above newtonhall  the hall is a proportionable room twenty paces in lenth here is

stands on the side of a hill sloping gradually toward the east a situation not chosen for strength near to it by the road side is a stone column but of what event it is a memorial history or tradition give no account the antiquity of this castle leads to conjectures as to the etymology of the name in many old records it is called ravenshelm and ravenswaith in the old spelling raffensweath the danish standard was called raffen and weath is a north country word now used in scotland for sorrow i should be very weath to do such an act is a phrase very commonly used in this country the application we would make is that ravensworth castle is of danish foundation and had its name from them as raffenshelm or the strong hold of the danish standard and that some defeat of that people had occasioned the name of raffensweath or danish woe all etymologies where there is such a mixture of languages as in this country will be subject to much uncertainty and we offer this only as a vague conjecture this castle has anciently formed a complete square with a tower at each corner connected with a curtain wall whether there was any keep or other structure in the center it is not possible to determine two of the towers form part of the offices to the present mansion the other two project to the front the apartments are small but neat without much ornament the breakfast room and room above it are modern and face the south with a bow window the lower one stuccoed the upper room elegantly fitted up and hung with tapestry of antwerp at one end of the room the landscape work is strikingly beautiful in the style of pousin there is a spacious saloon staircase and a good dining room the castle is shut in to the north and west by a fine forest of oaks the nursery of a large breed of herons and some pheasants the south aspect consists of rich meadow lands scattered over with large trees at irregular distances to the east the vale of lamesley beautifully clothed with wood is extended to the eye for a mile and a half immediately opposite at the greatest distance gatesheadfell wild and shaken with a multitude of hovels and cottages  soon after bishop flambard came to the

great roman road which we may suppose was in good preservation in those days  there is not the least doubt the romans had a considerable station here horsleys brit romans p          several roman antiquities have been found here which are taken notice of by dr hunter in the philosophical transactions no     one of these is a tall altar but no visible inscription upon it another is said to be a man in a roman dress upon a gravestone near the church door the image is very obscure nor do i see how it can now be discerned whether male or female for there is no inscription at all and the features are quite gone there have been two dolphins one on each side the image which is somewhat peculiar when i viewed it the small figure at the top appeared like a pineapple or perhaps a bunch of ears of corn and that on the side of the image seemed designed for a wreath i doubt not but it has been sepulchral and that the image was intended to represent the person deceased when the ancients erected their own tombs in their life time they often left the inscriptions and sometimes their essigies to be cut by their relations or friends after their decease so gorius gor monument libert etc live aug p  0  in his description of a large funeral vault lately discovered near rome has given us the draught of a marble coffin with a bust of the deceased person cut upon the side but only a round ball for the head which doubtless was designed to have been afterward finished and upon another there is a whole human figure finished except the head which is left in the same manner with the former and in several of the niches made in the side of the monument which contained two urns the inscription is cut over one only and that part of the stone which is placed over the other is empty the person being then living for whom that urn was designed  have this in camden is placed among the lanchester inscriptions but it is plain from dr hunters account that it was found at ebchester it was first in the doctors own possession and is in the library at durham it has been a sepulchral monument and have is for ave as in gruter have meletina suavissima the custom of thus saluting as it were the dead or taking their last farewell of them is very well known and it may seem almost needless to produce any instances of it thus aeneas bids eternal adieu to pallas salve aeternum mihi maxume palla aeternumque vale ave atque vale aen xi    catullus  thus also achilles salutes his dead friend patroclus  hom ii ps v     i shall not insist on the novissima verba ter vocati etc but old priams words spoken with reference to this custom are so moving that i must beg leave to transcribe them sic o sic positum adfati discedite corpus aeneid ii      there is another stone of a like figure which probably has stood beside it but there never has been any letters upon it  deo vitiri maximus votum solvit  this according to the account in camden was also found in this place it is a small altar erected to the local god vitires to whom we find a good number of altars inscribed the letter a having no transverse is included in m at the beginning of the third line and the m and v are connected as usual the letters are meanly cut on one side of the altar is a boar and a toad on the other it may deserve to be considered why these noxious creatures should be represented on altars whether it might be that they who erected the altars were much molested with them and addressed to the deities to be delivered from them it is well known that the ancients used to address to different deities for different benefits and ascribe names to them suited to the favors which they imagined they received from them thus apollo is said to have been called  by the greeks for destroying mice  in their language signifying a mouse and as this country might anciently have been infested both with boars and toads the inhabitants might apply to this god vitires on that account and since it was customary with the romans to adopt into their worship the deities of those nations which they conquered this maximus might for that reason erect an altar to the god vitires and cut the figures of these two animals upon it  vvnb ocem vit this fragment is in the outside of a garden wall at the end of the town i take it to have been a piece of an altar it is difficult to make numinibus oceani of it or to account for it if it be read so possibly the vit in the last line may have been part of vitam that is ob vitam servatam or some such thing  parcite caerulei vos saltem numina ponti infestumque mihi sit satis esse jovem ovid trist lib i cl  we are also told in camden that an urn was found here of a very uncommon shape near a yard high and not above seven inches wide with a little cup in the heart of it perhaps for an oblation of tears or of wine and milk such as the romans used at the burying of their dead  several stones of the centurial kind have been found here one was discovered a few days before i came there and is very clear and distinct having been erected by the fifth cohort of some legion most likely of the legio sexta victrix  there is another centurial stone which i have represented at large in order to show that these stones were generally like what masons call through stones or however that they were very long and went a great way into the wall twice or thrice as far as the other facing stones sometimes they are as this in the form of a parallelopepid and sometimes of a pyramidal i can make nothing out of the letters which appear on this  there are four other centurial stones found here the two first and finest of them are in the front of a house near the door but not a visible letter upon them the next is in the end of a house and whether the cross within be designed for an ch cohors decima or only ornamental i cannot be certain the last with no   upon it was before the door of a dwelling house the single stroke at last is to me unintelligible it may be part of an l for legionis so great a number of these sort of inscriptions make it probable that this sort was built by the legionary cohorts upon which occasion these stones as usual were inserted in the face of the ramparts or the inscriptions cut out upon them  minervae julius gnenius actarius cohortis quartae brittonum antoniniae votum solvit libentissime merito  mr horsley has placed this amongst the inscriptions and sculptures of northumberland and says it was of mr warburtons collection and is now in the library at durham from whence it came or where it was found he does not certainly know  romans britan observe     but dr hunter tells us it was taken out of the corner of a barn at ebchester by the direction of dr montague late dean of durham to be preserved in the library at durham mr horsley says i cannot find that this stone has ever been published before though it certainly has been curious when perfect it has been plainly the face of an altar and not only the capital and base but part of the plane itself is also demolished for a line or more has been broken off the top and two or three letters at least from every line on the left side actarius was an officer who used to provide corn for the forces  there are the remains of two piers in the river derwent supposed by some to be part of a roman bridge but the present bridge near ebchester being constructed on piers with a platform of wood indicates that the first mentioned are much more modern than the time of the romans and were forsaken for a more commodious passage  extract of a letter from mr john warburton to mr gale it is strange there should be but four great roman roads recorded when there are such numbers of them and more that the greatest of them all should want a name viz that which comes from the roman wall near dunbrytton frith in scotland to rochester in northumberland where antoninus begins his first journey and from thence continues its course by corbridge ebchester lanchester binchester pierebridge caterick aldbrough and i believe might thence be traced directly forward through london to dover and this without intersering with any of the four great roads it is well if higden or whoever was the first describer of those ways was not mistaken in his placing the watling street the course he has taken for it seems far too short and out of the way and i rather agree with talbot who thinks that antoninuss second journey was along it viz from the west end of the picts wall to southampton which i think much more probable as it enters the country on gathertey moor etc  gales mss   extract of another letter from mr warburten to mr gale i have read your essay toward a recovery of the four great roman ways over and over with greater pleasure than i ever read any thing in my life and am fully convinced that the course you have taken for those ancient roads are perfectly right excepting that you lose the stem of the ermin street upon gatherley moor and follow only two branches of it that go directly to tinmouth and boulness the two extremes of the picts wall while the main street proceeds northward almost in a straight line and uninterrupted ridge from piercebridge close by a small village called denton where there are many remains of antiquity and from thence continues its course by bolam houghton st helens auckland and soon after crosses the were to binchester vinovium where there are to be seen the vestigia of a roman fort several altars and in the possession of farer wren esquire the lord of the soil a great number of roman coins dug up there from this place its course is generally over moorish ground to lanchester and six miles further to ebchester where it crosses the river derwent and enters northumberland but before i leave ebchester which is inferior to no place i have mentioned for antiquities i cannot but acquaint you that i look upon it to have been the vindomora of antoninus and not at wallsend where that station has hitherto been fixed since it exactly answers the distance between corstopitum and vinovium the  d and  th stations in the first iter viz nine miles from the first of them and nineteen from the latter and this in a direct line along one of of the most entire regular and large ways i ever saw the ridge being for the most part two yards in height full eight yards broad and all paved with stone that it is at present as even as if new laid whereas from constapitum or corbridge to wallsend the  d station in the first iter it is twenty miles directly cast and from thence back to vinovium the  th station twentyfive miles to the westward so that we are carried eighteen miles about upon a road that has no appearance of a military way except just where it touches the picts wall and has the river tyne to pass in a part where it never could be crossed without boats which are difficulties i think the romans would never subject themselves to   printed in the sixth vol of lel itin published by mr tho hearn at oxford in      page       although camden in his edition of the britannia of      does not notice it the traces of the vallum are yet apparent though cut in some places by buildings so as to render it impossible to take the exact dimensions the square being about one hundred and sixty paces as we could compute on the side next to the river running along the brink of a steep declivity also many curious pieces of antiquity have been discovered here as set forth in the notes some since the learned antiquaries there mentioned visited the place particularly three inscriptions which the reverend mr jefferson for their preservation caused to be fixed in the wall of the curacy house    in the wall of another house is the following inscription and in      by the washing of the flood in the banks of derwent this altar was discovered now in the possession of h swinburne esquire it is two feet six inches high and thirteen inches thick the characters well cut and mostly distinct see gent mag sup       in the first iter of antonines itinerary the distances of the stations in the county of durham are thus laid down including the next

vindomora nine miles distant from corstopitum according to the itinerary and this next station at ebchester is distant from corbridge about seven computed miles and near ten measured as was found on actual mensuration with a chain this therefore is no doubt vindomora and here again as in almost all cases the roman miles fall short in number of our english measured almost one in ten which confirms the roman to be horizontal the people told me of two or three load of burnt ashes found here with some large bones and teeth the roman inscriptions and monuments that have been found here may be seen in the collection  in the year      a countryman with his plough fixed upon somewhat he could not overturn he opened the earth and found an oblong square stone which by more assistance was removed finding under it a cavity composed of six erected stones the interstices walled up and therein an urn about eight inches in height what is included within the brackets are dr hunters ms observations on the margin of the britannia penes leo hartley  dr gale seems to think that vindolana and vindolande in ravennas are the same with vindomora in the itinerary and then from the affinity of the sound concludes dolande to be it but i believe the name is dotland and this is rather too near corstopitum even though we should prefer the copy that is five miles for the distance instead of nine but to wave these smaller matters it is certain that vindomora and vindolana are two different places and that dotland can neither be one nor the other for this is quite off the military way and there is no appearance of roman antiquity here as to camdens opinion of vindomora being wallsend and vindobola being the same it is needless to confute it or to add any thing more on this head  at a roman mile and a half distance to the south some years ago was discovered the foundation of a square watch tower about   or   yards on the west side of the military way the stones were cemented with lime dr hunter in another of his ms observations in the year      says a little south of the southwest angle of the ramparts i discovered part of the aqueduct that brought water to the baths it was composed of two erected flat stones cemented into two niches cut in one laid flat for the bottom i am apt to think the ditch of the fortress has been supplied by another aqueduct    about five computed and six measured miles and a half more along the same military way which is still very certain and often very grand bring us to the large and remarkable station at lanchester which is not mentioned in this iter the true reasons of which silence i take to be these that it is too nigh the last station to finish the days march here and that it belongs to another iter which i shall endeavor to show in its proper place does begin at this station etc    we paid attention to the great roman road which leads to this place from the southward and found it remarkably perfect where the new enclosures of common lands had not taken place we traced it for a considerable distance so as to enable us strictly to ascertain the dimensions it is formed in three distinct parts with four ditches a center road probably made for carriages and cavalry fortytwo feet in width with a narrow road on each side for foot passengers twelve feet wide as we had not observed this form in any of the roads in northumberland or on the line of the wall it made us more attentive to ascertain the matter in the vicinity of large cities our modern roads have the like conveniences in this northern situation the circumstance here increases our ideas of the roman power and possession when such a station as ebchester required such conveniences either for the ease of passengers or to accommodate troops who should line the roads

establish those works which have employed multitudes of people and caused an influx of wealth since that happy era to this country he first sat down at sunderland by the sea where in its infancy the project was nursed for five or six years but the situation of this place and its environs both in regard to coals and water induced him to transplant his cyclopean colony hither the town of winlayton stands on a high ridge of country inclining on the east north and south toward the rivers tyne and derwent before sir ambrose settled his people here the place consisted of a few deserted cottages and now contains about fifteen hundred inhabitants chiefly smiths the works carried on in this town are various making nails is the chief branch but there is an eye of jealousy on enquiry and the traveller can reap little information as to the various articles manufactured or quantity produced the buildings are regular and calculated for convenience and not show the streets are well paved a commodious chapel was built in the year   0  which will receive three hundred people at divine service and a stipend provided for a chaplain the chapel is said to be erected on the site of an old

in      to which is prefixed a letter of lord crewes dated from durham castle   d of september    0 setting forth that mr jonathan story had been very instrumental in that work the narrative is addressed to henry lord hyde by mr story and comprehends an oration delivered by him to the people on occasion of an attempt to found a dissenting meeting house at winlaton where he represents were settled in the manufactory above two thousand souls mr story though not of the church in his oration first expatiated on the excellency of religion in general second the advantage it has in the minds of men third the excellency of the christian religion in particular and lastly full thoughts on the established church of england and he recapitulates the circumstances attending the year      and the succeeding times with much warmth  the first place for ping i which was licenced   0   was the hall belonging to sir william blacket bart in june the manufacturers chose a minister of their own and contributed one half farthing in the shilling for all wages they should receive for his support which made up a considerable sum and being augmented with ten pounds a year given by the proprietors of the works made a comfortable subsistence for their clergyman besides paying all other incident charges of the chapel at length a certain stipend of fifty pounds a year was fixed for the minister and the beforementioned allowance became sufficient to yield above twenty pounds a year for a school a subscription was next set on foot for building the chapel which was begun the   th of april   0  on the   d of august following it was fit to receive the congregation and in january following it was fully finished and beautified regularly pewed and a large gallery at the west end with a turret and clock daily service is performed therein    winlayton mill which in the last century was used for corn and had a few cottages near it now is surrounded with a considerable village where the iron works are also carried on it is in a pleasant situation on the banks of derwent with an open prospect toward the east the number of people employed there may amount to about three hundred of all ages a stone in the mill dam shows the propitious year of its conversion      the chief work carried on there is making and grinding edge tools slitting bars of iron into long narrow pieces proper for making nails etc steel is also blistered here and filemaking constitutes a considerable branch of the business together with a diversity of other articles  as we are speaking of the manufactory for the sake of connection we will advance to swalwell part of which town is in the parish of whickham it is seated on the banks of derwent near its influx with the tyne the principal part of the inhabitants are employed in iron works but in the most massive articles as ship anchors they make hoes and shovels and cast pots kettles and other domestic utensils  our obliging correspondent from whom we received

grand vista rises a fine ionic column of stone highly wrought not less as we compute than one hundred and forty feet in height finished with an elegant gilt statue of british liberty in whose service the person who erected the work was enthusiastically virtuous as you turn from this object you look upon a terrace above a mile in length terminated by a new chapel built in a most elegant style with a rich portico and dome highly embellished the chief parts of the mansion house are old of the architecture which prevailed in the beginning of the seventeenth century containing many spacious apartments the back part of the house is placed so near the brink of a very steep descent as merely to admit a terrace walk from whence is a prospect though narrow highly picturesque and beautiful you look down into a deep vale of meadow grounds washed by the river derwent shut in on the right by hanging woods and on the left by cultivated lands rising in irregular swells from the banks of the river and terminated in the center by a lofty cliff much shaken and torn walks are cut through the groves and wind along the margin of the river although nature has spread various rich gifts over the

church view of gateshead church the parish of gateshead the ancient borough of gateshead consists chiefly of one long street descending to the bridge leading over tyne to newcastle much doubt has arose with our antiquaries touching the etymology of the name it must content us to accept the saxon appellation of gaetsheved as sufficiently expressive of this place where if the romans had a bridge it is probable they also had a tower and gate for its defense and after the saxons were possessors we may conceive this material pass was strongly fortified and thence the name of gaetsheved may be derived from the circumstance of the street leading to the tower and gate of the bridge the word gaet or gate is commonly used for way in this country gabrocentum hodie gateshead sive ad caprina

tanner likewise cites bourne who in his history of newcastle says the monastery of uttanus was where mr riddles or gateshead house now is from the following passage in lelands itinerary vol vii part i page    added to the entry before quoted from dugdales catalogue it appears as if this monastery was converted into an hospital before the dissolution of religious houses whereas the hospital says he

per ann perhaps the former might be the value delivered into the kings commissioners and this its true amount from these obscure accounts little to be depended upon can be collected respecting its ancient history the following is its present state its remains stand in gateshead on the east or right hand side of the high street leading to newcastle bridge from which it is distant about half a mile the entrance is through a low square stone gate decorated with pilasters and seemingly of modern construction the site of the house with its offices and gardens occupied about two acres and a half of land toward the east end of it are the ruins of a mansion which from the style of its architecture seems to have been built since the dissolution of the monastery perhaps out of its materials this probably was mr riddles house alluded to by bourne and the gateway before mentioned was in all likelihood erected at the same time nearest the road stands the chapel whose west end is handsomely ornamented with a number of pointed arches and niches though the inside seems remarkably plain it consists of a single aile twentyone paces broad by twentysix long some steps at the east end leading to the altar are still remaining near them is a grave stone on which is cut a cross similar to that on the jamb of the church door at jarrow it has also the marks of an inlaid border about it but the brass is gone the arches of the windows except those of the east and west ends which are entirely pointed are round within and pointed on the outside a remarkable ornament is mounted on the east end on a slender rod being a small circle chequered by several bars crossing each other at right angles in the year      or    this chapel being as it is said made use of by the roman catholics was out of a misguided zeal set on fire by some persons who perhaps meant to pass for good protestants but by this their intolerant fury showed themselves to be actuated by those very principles they affected so much to contemn this monastery is now the property of ralph clavering esquire of callaly and is chiefly used for garden ground this account is attended with an elegant view of the chapel  the house and garden ground etc were purchased about two years ago by hen ellison esquire  the mines were reserved upon this sale     this account gives us ground to suppose that on the martyrdom of bishop walcher the old monastery and church were reduced to ashes but whether they were situated where mr gross has attempted to place them the reader will form his own conjectures in the quotation from the magna britannia it is said touching the hospital of st edmund who was the founder or benefactor is not known it is probable that the ruined monastery which had been a scene of such violation sacrilege and murder would lie under the horror of those crimes deserted and unrestored for some time and it was not till the year      that we hear of the hospital rising as mr gross has presumed from its

he granted to the master and brethren the hospital or edifice known by the name of the hospital or free chapel of st edmund king and martyr within the vill of gateshead or by the name of the hospital of st edmund the bishop in gateshead with the site of the mansion house and garden and certain lands at shotley bridge with all such their rights members liberties and appurtenances whatsoever which the master and brethren of the hospital aforesaid and their predecessors or any of them for the space of sixty years then last past and next preceding the date of these letters patent had uninterruptedly held and enjoyed and it was also thereby ordained that during the time of master hutton each of the three paupers should receive yearly  l  s  d out of the revenues of the endowment and after his time the masters should receive to their own use one third part only of the revenues and the other two parts be distributed to the brethren from this deed it may be understood by implication that the hospital had been a second time erected before the time of this charter the original constitution was totally altered and indeed one may apprehend that the first foundation was utterly dissolved who had again begun this pious work or when we have no record to show this charter tells us the muniments which evidenced the foundation and endowment were lost such could not be the case if it arose from the original institution by bishop farnham the more modern foundation in the distraction of those times which intervened between the year      and    0 might probably be lost or destroyed and this observation gains strength by the reference in the charter to sixty years quiet enjoyment by the master appointed thereby and his predecessors expressions not only useless but repugnant to common sense if the hospital was instantly rising under that charter not having other records to refer to in support of the idea we leave the conjectures for the readers application dr smith in his edition of bedes ecclesiast hist says that in gateside there are no footsteps remaining of the ancient monastery of uttanus but of a more modern one we see a most beautiful chapel which is not as yet in ruins there is a tradition that this was a cell of the nuns of newcastle though we cannot readily quote any authority for it the tradition appears somewhat probable for in the charter k hen   before mentioned the nuns of st bartholomew received   s annually from this cell  bourne p  0  this was one of the religious houses which by letters patent of king henry viii were new sounded and preserved from the dissolution of lesser monasteries  0th march a r    vol i hist reform col records         it was afterward resigned and suppressed  d january   st king henry viii  ibid         from all the uncertainties noted in the account of st edmunds it is probable king jamess foundation did not affect the chapel described by mr gross but that the nuns of newcastle had a cell there within the ancient limits of the hospital possessions perhaps on the site of the hospital of the holy trinity or that there were two hospitals one dedicated to st edmund the bishop and the other to st edmund king and martyr in distant and distinct situations or how can we reconcile the facts of the chapel so described going to decay and that together with the whole site of the adjacent buildings and surrounding lands being in lay hands for several generations totally unconnected with the present hospital notwithstanding the words of king jamess foundation charter bishop hatfields survey speaks of the hospitals of st edmund the king and st edmund the confessor distinctly vide notes preceding  there is an irreconcilable confusion in this subject and we are apt to believe there were two religious foundations here dedicated as before noted one to st edmund the confessor appropriated to st bartholomew in newcastle which was dissolved under the surrender of that monastery and another of a foundation now unknown which had been exempted from the dissolution and refounded by king james dedicated to st edmund king and martyr notwithstanding the complex description of lands etc in the royal charter mr riddles house was called gateshead house and as mr gross observes is of a mode of architecture denoting a date subsequent to the suppression of religious houses and whilst in his or

other bourne speaking of this bridge says it has been a query whether the bridge was originally of wood or stone but i think it is altogether needless all the bridges in england were originally of wood in the reign of king richard i philip bishop of durham sent to the burgages of gateside a grant of forestage in which are these words and it shall be lawful for every burgess to give wood to whomsoever he will to be spent about the river of tyne without any license this i imagine has been for building of keys and especially for the repairing of the bishops part of the bridge which is a further proof that this bridge was wood but what i think puts it beyond dispute is that according to matthew paris it was burnt in the year      together with a great part of the town p     in anglia vero etsi de aliis sileamus maxima pars burgi qui novum castrum super tinam appellatur cum ponte igne quasi furioso consumpta est  after this misfortune happened the town who repairs twothirds of the bridge and the bishop the other laid out their endeavors to raise up another bridge of stone accordingly the bishop of durham sent out indulgences and the town procured other bishops to do the same to all that would assist either with money or labor by which they got a sum sufficient the archdeacon of northumberland wrote to the clergy of his archdeaconry to assist the work of the bridge telling them their venerable father the lord bishop of durham by his letters patent had commanded them without any let or delay to go about the affair of the indulgences and that they were to prefer the episcopal indulgences to others and what arose from them was to be given to the master of the bridge whose name was laurentius for the use of the bridge lib cart many other indulgences were granted

  as before mentioned the bridge after the conflagration in      was rebuilt on twelve stone arches three of which by the construction of quays on the newcastle side were thought unnecessary and converted into cellars about the middle of the bridge a tower was erected with machicolations and iron gates a little to the southward of which the boundary stone was fixed to distinguish the division of the counties the end from thence to gateshead belonging to the bishop of durham at the south end was another tower and from the vacancy in the archings there wanting an arch near the southern tower it has been presumed there was in that space a drawbridge the bishops of durham have for time immemorial possessed all rights and privileges of the bridge from the boundary stone southwards being called a third part and granted leases for lives or years of all houses and shops erected thereon and as occasion required repaired that part of the bridge in july    0 bishop trevor repaired with stone the space before noted where it is supposed the drawbridge was it was laid with large beams of timber and covered with thick planks upon which the pavement was made this work was begun on saturday night or sunday morning and finished on thursday following all the materials of stone being previously prepared and a proper number of workmen with boats and wherries above and below bridge for conveying passengers and carriages over the river during the time of the work in the night between the   th and   th of november      there was a flood in the river tyne greatly exceeding any noted in history or otherwise known by the force of which an arch north of the tollgate was first swept away a curious view of the ruined bridge was engraved and published by mr beilby of newcastle  then another on the south end fell with eight houses on the west side of it those on the east hanging by their timbers on monday the   th about four in the afternoon another of the south arches fell with the houses thereon and the remaining parts of the bridge were so much shattered that it was necessary to take the superstructure down only seven persons were lost by the fall of the several houses the river began to rise at newcastle about twelve oclock on saturday night and at five in the morning the arches of the bridge were filled so that a current was forced into the west end of the street called the close which runs parallel with the river it overflowed the sandhillsquare so that boats plied there and many of the shops had five feet water in them the water exceeded every other flood of which we have any note by eight perpendicular feet in height and infinite loss and damage was sustained on the shores and in the shiping and craft in      an act of parliament was obtained for making a temporary bridge by the corporate body of newcastle to continue for seven years provided a new one of stone was not erected or the old bridge restored in less time with tollgates thereon and the tolls to be applied in reimbursing to the corporation such money as they should expend therein over and above the sum of   00l which they voluntarily gave to the work and in the same year an act of parliament was made to enable the lord bishop of durham and his successors to raise a competent sum of money to be applied for repairing improving or rebuilding such part of tyne bridge as belongs to the sea of durham the preamble sets forth that the lord bishop of durham is entitled in right of his see to onethird part of an ancient bridge extending across the river tyne between the town of gateshead in the county palatine of durham and the town of newcastle upon tyne and that by the violence and rapidity of a most extraordinary flood which happened on the   th day of november      in the river tyne the said bridge was damaged and broken down in several places and rendered impassable and in order to restore an easy and safe communication between the counties of durham and northumberland it is highly expedient that the said bridge should be rebuilt and effectually repaired with all possible expedition and that the necessary repairs of onethird part of the said bridge belonging to the bishop of durham in right of his see and extending from two blue marble or boundary stones on the south side of the said bridge to the town of gateshead will be attended with great expense and however reasonable or proper it may be that the entire sum necessary to be appropriated for and employed in that useful and necessary work ought to be raised out of or secured upon the revenues and possessions of the said see of durham and that the bishop of durham for the time being ought not to bear any greater burden than shall arise from the interest or annual charge to be paid in respect of the principal money to be raised for the purpose aforesaid yet the said lord bishop consenting that a reasonable and adequate sum of money may be raised by authority of parliament by granting annuities for lives which will not only be speedy and effectual but may be a method less burdensome to the successors in the said see than to the said now lord bishop by the eventual dropping in of lives and the decrease of such temporary charge it is thereby enacted that the chancellor of the bishopric and county palatine of durham and sadberge the sheriff of the county etc the vicar general and principal official of the diocese of durham the attorney and solicitor general to the lord bishop of durham the principal register or registrar of the diocese of durham the auditor to the

situation for if the original monastery was placed where the present ruins are the ground is elevated and forms a curvature toward the great bay called the slake which ancient authors tell us was the

not of long continuance for in the seventh year of osberts reign the danes again entered the tyne practicing their accustomed rapine and devastation and laying waste all the religious houses in the interval whilst the sea or episcopal seat was fixed at chester we may reasonably presume the monastery at jarrow was again restored and from the style and order of architecture we are led to conjecture that part of the structures standing at the time we visited them were of that age but the religious body had not yet sustained the last of their misfortunes for though subject to all the miseries of the provincial war which distracted this part of the island during the struggles between the saxon and danish sovereigns when they were frequently pillaged and laid under contributions upon the enraged normans marching northward and finding the city of durham deserted and the country evacuated they put their sacrilegious hands to this monastery and notwithstanding they boasted of the dispensation of the gospel yet as savage as the unenlightened barbarians of the north they reduced the sacred edifices again to ashes having advanced to this period we should now pay attention to the venerable character of bid and present to the reader some short anecdotes of his life  this holy monk was born about the year     in a part of this county adjoining the river were where the monastery of weremouth afterward had lands that house not being founded till the year     according to his own account thereof much controversy has happened relative to the place of his nativity but it is well settled by historians that he was born in the district before mentioned at seven years of age he was taken into the monastery at weremouth and under the care of abbot benedict and his successor ceolfrid received his education at the age of nineteen was ordained deacon and became exemplary at that early stage for his piety and studious life the attention paid to him by all ranks of people so far from moving him with vanity or tempting him to negligence seemed only to excite him to a more eager pursuit of learning and stricter rules of religious conduct insomuch that his character was held forth as a pattern of christian virtues and his life as an example of monastic duty about the year     in the fifteenth of king egfrid the monastery of jarrow was founded under the conduct and superintendency of benedict bid attained his thirtieth year before he was ordained priest which office was performed by john of beverley then bishop of hexham who had been his preceptor and entertained great affection for him much of his excellent character was deduced from maxims instilled by that great teacher which he constantly professed to follow as the chief principles of his conduct his great diligence and application comprehensive genius and extensive learning rendered his name so famous that he became the subject of attention in foreign countries particularly at rome where pope sergius struck with the accounts he heard of this illustrious scholar wrote to his superior the abbot ceolfrid to send him thither that he might converse with him on some momentous subjects bid as singular in his modesty as accomplishments received the summons without any of that emotion this flattering distinction would have roused in many other minds but attentive alone to his studies and the due performance of religious duties he was not to be allured from his cell by the smiles of potentates and the courtesy of princes it has been remarked by many authors that in pursuance of ceolfrids command he was ordained priest preparatory to his journey to rome but why he did not obey the call has not been accounted for by those writers further than that it is observed the pope died in  0  which event might not be known in england at the time of our monks receiving ordination no notice is taken of the foregoing circumstances by bid in any of his writings and the whole rests chiefly on the account given by william of malmsbury and his copyists it is certain he showed at all times a particular desire for privacy and retirement an avidity for learning and an incessant application to study together with a warm affection for his native country such might operate powerfully with his own mind against the journey whilst the consequence he was of to the northern clergy might influence the great people to sue for his release from an engagement so disagreeable to his own wishes and contrary to the interests of his country by remaining in his monastery and habituating himself to a recluse life he had sufficient time to make himself master of every branch of literature which at that period had gained a footing in this island and his acquisitions were made without any apparent desire of same or promotion but merely to render himself useful to society and for the promotion of religion and virtue it was from such principles that he applied himself for several years in collecting materials for his ecclesiastical history which received in the early ages of the english church infinite applause and at this time is esteemed an inestimable record in the composition of which great work the several legendary and miraculous relations are considered as merely the errors of the age and not blots of the excellent pen which related them though bid was bred at weremouth yet it is admitted by all writers he took up his residence at jarrow soon after that monastery was founded and the same superior governing both houses much intercourse was had between the religious societies so that we see him at periods spoken of by some writers as a monk of weremouth and by others of jarrow which variance is easily reconciled when we consider the beforerelated fact bid published his ecclesiastical history in     when according to his own account he was fiftynine years of age but before this he had written many other books on a variety of subjects a catalogue of which he subjoined to that great work there was a strict friendship subsisting between egbert bishop of york and bid which produced a letter from our monk descriptive of the tempers and characters of both and giving a picture of the manners of the age and the state of the church such as no other authority supplies full of servour religious censure virtuous zeal and bold condemnation the letter discovers the collective mind of the author whilst his prophetic reasonings and the distant consequences he deduced and predicted from the inordinances described show the shrewdness of his judgment and the capaciousness of his observation he foresaw the multiplying of religious foundations and the want of discipline which daily broke in upon the conventual rules would bring on the destruction which in after ages took place when he wrote this epistle he was in a bad state of health his death from that time advancing by a gradual decay yet in all the progressive stages of the disease he did not neglect his duty he employed the usual hours in writing in study in devotion in exhortation of the brethren and teaching his disciples of the convent he endured the attacks of death with great fortitude exemplary piety and holy resignation and expired on the   th of may being the feast of the ascension in the year     epilogum de obitu bedae ex sine libri  i gulielm a maildulphi curia de

increasing rapidly the bishop granted various lands for their support and they began to rebuild their church the reader will revert to the account given of this society under the annals of bishop walcher bishop william de carilepho confirmed to the monks of jarrow the endowment made by his predecessor and soon after removing the seculars from the cathedral church he translated the monks of

the side walls of which were two pointed arches that to the north built up the other opening into a porch used as a vestry room the groins were sprung from brackets and the span was about twenty feet the nave was twentyeight paces in length and only six in width so that from the height of the side walls which were nearly thirty feet and the small irregular windows scattered on each side the edifice had a very singular appearance some of the windows were under circular arches others pointed and all the walling so patched and irregular that it was not to be distinguished to what age any particular part of it belonged the congregation had deserted the nave for some years perhaps from dread of being buried in its ruins and the chancel alone was used for divine service fixed in the southeast corner of the nave was a mount whereon a stone pulpit formerly stood the roodloft remained being a gallery of wood work across the church above the entrance into the chancel on which were

liberties prescribed to in the bill the issues related to jarrow slake only the decree would bind the dean and chapters right in all other parts of the river and to quiet the plaintiffs in their

matters from thence as may seem important as to the issues being particular to jarrow slake and the decree general to the whole river the plaintiffs counsel gave no answer but the lord chief baron wondered how it had crept into the decree and agreed that the decree could only be particular as to jarrow slake they gave no answer to the objection that the plaintiffs ought to derive their conservatorship from the crown the chief baron cited many instances of pepetual injunctions but it was agreed they have been only in use since the reign of king charles i as to the records the plaintiffs counsel alleged that it did not appear any thing was done under the commissions of conservatorship or that the mayor of newcastle ever accepted them to which it was answered the acceptance must be presumed if nothing is shown to the contrary as to the  d article the record of king henry i being of date beyond memory ought not to be given in evidence without showing an allowance of it in air cases cited to the contrary in answer  d article opposed the reading of it affirming it to be only an action of trespass prosecuted by the bishop for trespass done in taking away ships etc and being betwixt other parties ought not to be read this the chief baron overruled but observed it was a strange sort of commission being a special commission of oyer and terminer to hear and determine one particular trespass which he thought the king himself had not a power to grant  mr dormer answered that there were special customs in the county palatine different from the common and ordinary customs of the realm and his lordships commission when he sat there as judge was ad audiendum and terminand secundum legem terrae and consuetud dunelm  th article mr mulso objected that upon attempts

liberas consuetudines quas habere consueverunt tempore hen   patris nostri and said he looked upon that charter of king johns to be only a charter of confirmation serj lutwich likewise insisted that

rising from the corners and the ribs uniting in the center the circumstance of the pillars not standing square but forming an oblong north and south was remarkable the width of this part was only five

know one instance where the tower stands between the chancel and nave that there is not or anciently was a cross aile and few have the tower in that situation but churches of more than ordinary

three lights under a pointed arch on the north side there were two windows one under a circular arch and the other a pointed arch one window to the south close by the tower having also a pointed arch

point of land are particularly beautiful but that from the roperywalk excels every thing of the kind in the north of england the river thronged with vessels and animated with an incessant passage of small craft is close on your left hand the batteries and barracks on the northern shore display a striking military scene whilst on the more distant ground from the brow of lofty rocks rise the venerable remains of tinmouth priory at the time we saw this prospect the cliffs were gilded with the evening sun the dashing billows which broke over the bar of the river drove their foam against the precipices over which the solemn abbey in the weeds of ruin with distracted aspect sinking under the destroying hand of time completed such an assemblage of picturesque objects as seldom are found in a space so confined  bourne speaking of the river tyne says the mouth of the river forms a haven so deep as to carry vessels of a considerable burden and of that security that they are not in danger either of storms or shallows save that within less than half a mile of the bar of tinmouth which is a sand that lies cross the rivers mouth not above seven feet deep at low water you meet with many rocks which are called by the sailors the black middens which are very dangerous but to prevent any mischiefs which might happen in the night time there are two lighthouses maintained by the trinityhouse in newcastle and near them in the year      was built a fort called cliffords fort which effectually commands all the vessels that enter the river  many judicious antiquaries have been of opinion that there was a roman station at the point of land near southshields and indeed the importance of this river was such that we can scarcely imagine so cautious and intelligent a people would have neglected the southern shore where an enemys troops at some seasons might safely be disembarked if the coast was unguarded horsleys brit romans p     there has been a roman station here and to this belong the three following antiquities  an altar was when i took the draught of it upon the spot where the station has been lying at the northwest corner dr hunter has since got it removed to the library of durham where i saw it when last there  it is of a coarse brown stone much of the same nature with what we frequently meet with in other roman altars though the people here tell me no such stone is now to be found in these parts the usual sacrificing vessels are upon the sides of the altars and the knife upon the back which is not so common  there has no doubt been an inscription upon this altar though it is now entirely effaced yet as this was the only original i could recover belonging to this station i thought proper to give a draught of it  besides this two other altars have been found at this place one of which as i am informed was built up in a quay wall about forty years ago and is not now to be come at the other was first sent to york to dr lister and since his death as i have been told was sent to norwich to one mr giles and i suppose is now lost dr lister published it in the transactions no     and from thence it has been inserted in camdens brit and in dr gales edition of antonines itinerary p    dis matribus pro salute imperatoris marci aurelii antonini augusti pii felicis  lubens merito ob reditum i have taken the draught of the altar and inscription from the copy of dr lister compared with the others and given a reading of the inscription somewhat different from dr listers and only pricked those letters or parts of letters which i imagine ought to be supplied as it is not usual to place the word imperator after the name of the emperor so i see no occasion for doing it here the doctor observes that this altar might be erected for caracalla when going into caledonia severus is i believe generally joined to caracalla in the inscriptions before the caledonian expedition as he was in the expedition itself this makes it less probable that caracalla is intended in the inscription and yet ob reditum and the titles pii felicis dont seem to suit marcus aurelius nor ob reditum commodus though to him pius felix are usually annexed so that i suppose it yet more improbable that either of these are intended nor do i think there is much in having both pro salute and ob reditum in the inscription it is for his safe return pro salute itus et reditus is not uncommon  extract from professor wards letter to mr horsley page     dr lister who first wrote out this inscription and from whose copy the others have since been taken tells us that it contained nine lines and therefore has left a space between the fifth and sixth line sufficient to contain two others in this space the names of the person who erected the altar might probably be inserted  and as it appears by the doctors draught that the inscription filled up the whole space of the altar it is scarce credible to me so great a chasm should be left between lv and bens i cannot but think therefore that a letter or two are wanting here which may have been li in libens and that so might have been at the end of the preceding line which joined to l at the beginning of this would stand for solvit as v that follows may be votum this is agreeable to the usual form solvit votum libens merito suits the space and renders the inscription complete  dis manibus this is a fragment lately discovered i believe by the remains of the pediment which has been at the top and the imperfect letter which is visible that it has been sepulchral      extract of a letter from dr hunter of durham to roger gale esquire may         give me leave to attempt the recovery of one of the roman stations in this country both requisite for the security of the navigation into the northern seas and the protection of their frontiers beyond the river tyne thereby saving the great expense and trouble of building the wall as far as the sea at tinmouth no less than three miles i mean that near southshields at the entrance of the river into the ocean and which cannot but have flourished till the danish invasions as mr leland has it in his collectanea vol iv p    e regione tinemuthae fuit urbs vastata a danis urfa nomine ubi natus erat oswinus rex the communication there was with binchester is visible in several places as is the angle where the paved way goes off from the military way leading to lanchester about three miles to the north of binchester and passes to the north east through brancepethpark thence a little to the south of brandon behind willington the road is very distinct a mile stone was lately discovered there with an inscription described to be legible but when we went to look after it the farmers had totally obliterated the whole and squared the pillar to form some part of the sold for their cattle  ex historia incerti authoris de paucis northumbr regibus and episcopus transhumbrianis  ferunt quidem s regem oswinum natum in quodam castro burgh

cultivated grounds but appearing upon durham moor in the same direction again passing by haghouse and below upon harbrass moor is very visible tending past lumley castle in a direct line toward southshields passing about a mile east of that of chesterinthestreet without any signs of communication therewith two elevated pavements in the river tyne the one at the west end of southshields the other on the north side of the river near the end of the roman wall proper for their safe landing at different times of the ebbing and flowing tide fully show its necessary correspondence with segedunum the first station upon the wall but another military way called wreken dyke that there has been a roman station at southshields is out of all question the altars that have been found there and the military way which has gone from it are convincing proofs of this i once imagined this station might have been the old glanoventa which no doubt was the most easterly on this rout at that time mentioned in the itinerary and in the notitia and that this iter had begun here and proceeded according to the military way leading from hence to lanchester but the distances in the itinerary are not to be reconciled to the distances between the respective stations on this way if we begin at southshields besides that the slender remains of the station and military way near it incline me to think it has not been mentioned so late as till the writing of the notitia that it was in being at the time of marcus aurelius appears from the altar and inscription found here if dr listers reading be just but i am apt to think it was abandoned not very long after perhaps at the building of severuss wall and the station erected at cousins house or a little after this station seems not to be named either in ptolemy the itinerary or notitia unless we suppose ostia vedrae in ptolemy to be as well the name of the station as of the river mouth  i know no other name for the roman station and town at the mouth of the river  vedra tine near southshields but ostia vedrae if we consider the station itself the altar inscribed to one of the antonines and the nearness of the place to the roman wall one can scarce suppose that the river and station should be wholly unknown to ptolemy and yet unless these be their names they are nameless in this geographer i own the force of this argument is abated when we consider that neither newcastle nor any other of the roman places on the wall are mentioned by this ancient author but it is true that towns rather than sorts came under ptolemys notice  in this place it will not be amiss to take notice of wreken dyke the military way so called this military way has no doubt terminated at southshields it seems to have come from the station and to have crossed the marsh then possibly a branch of the river not far from the station thence it has passed most probably through or a little to the east of a house called laygate from thence it seems to have gone near a house called the barns the garden wall probably standing on it and so on to the dean bridge close by jarrow slake for this space the traces of this way are very obscure and uncertain in the field beyond this bridge the track of it is plain and for near the full breadth of the enclosure sensibly raised above the level of the rest of the ground though it runs cross the ridges on the west side of this field or enclosure there is a small descent and in the bottom a lane which is the high road from bowden to shields and a small ascent on the other side in the field joining this lane as the military way ascends on the one side and descends on the other it is bent into a curve and then falls into the right line in which it seems to be continued all the way to gateshead fell for the space of five or six miles from thence it goes toward lamesley and kibblesworth which it leaves a little to the south it was very visible all the way not many years ago before sir henry liddell enclosed and improved those grounds and the gardener at cousins house who formerly wrought on gateshead fell assured me he had seen and helped to dig up some stones out of wreken dyke which he called bracken dyke so that he was altogether of opinion that this part of it had been paved this way passes on toward beamish and i make no doubt has gone forward to lanchester it is indeed lost on the moor beyond beamish nor is it any great wonder it should be so considering how mossy and lost it is i was assured at lanchester that several trees had been dug up in this moor which had been cut down with an ax probably to clear this way and if these trees have been sunk so much below the surface no wonder if a heavy military way be much more so i have heard a traditionary account of this ways passing by stanley toward lanchester though i know not how far this may be relied on but how little of such military ways appear in some other places where it might have been better expected there is a remarkable tumulus near this way not far from ravensworth besides which i observed another very considerable one about a mile from lanchester called the maidenlaw and probably the military way has not been far from this tumulus i am surprised to find the military way which goes from southshields usually represented to pass near to durham sometimes on the east and sometimes on the west side of it when there is such plain demonstration not only of the reality of the way but of the range and tendency of it but i believe the military way which is supposed to have gone from newcastle to chester and from thence to watlingstreet near binchester has occasioned the mistake the gardener at cousins house said he had observed when he wrought thereabouts this military way from newcastle to chester and that it lay to the west of the present highway through the sell dr hunter was positive he had observed the same way upon the sell as also some remaining track of a via vicinalis beyond chester between binchester and brancepeth castle as i remember pointing toward chester which he therefore concluded must have gone that way  horsley     0 wreken dyke is the boundary between gateshead fell and eighton common and may be seen as it passes through eighton quarries and at the north end of the village of eighton from thence down one of lord ravensworths new enclosures and crossing the high road leading to newcastle from chester it appears plain in an enclosure on the west side of the road the ridge not having been ploughed and it is partly over run with broom and there is a foot path on the ridge of it       the field on the west side of the road was ploughed up but the footpath on the ridge of the way was continued and visible  gylls mss  mr horsleys remarks on the etymology of wreken dyke  ichning or icknild seems sometimes to have been corrupted into ricknild or richning as appears from the names of some places that are supposed to be derived from the name of this street drayton in his pollyolbion brings in watlingstreet as speaking thus and rickneld forth that weight of cambrias shore where s wales now shoots forth st davids promontore and on his midway near did me in england meet then in his oblique course the lusty straggling street soon overtook the fosse and toward the fall of tine into the german sea dissolved at his decline  it is too great a force to suppose racking corrupted from roman and racking dyke from roman dyke and yet there does not appear much more violence in this than in supposing raven in ravens dyke or bank to have come from the word roman which our best antiquaries seem to agree in from the like conjecture one might be inclined to think that ravens worth is from romans worth for the village of ravensworth is just by the military way though the castle be at some distance but i know no better conjecture with respect to this etymology than that it has been from warken dyke or wrought dyke that is a dyke of great labor and work according to our northern pronunciation it consists of firm gravel and sand very hard and compact so as to make a very good way at this time at all seasons of the year i also believe it has a mixture of stone or somewhat of pavement    passing from this station to the west has hitherto frustrated the enquiries of our late antiquaries mr horsley himself pointing out its ductus very justly over gateshead fell where it passed the public road and a little to the west the roman way going to the south from newcastle to chesterinthestreet and afterward running through lamesley and kibblesworth fields advances to the southwest over blackburn moor and through the township of hedley it comes next to causey a village which owes its name to it and from thence ascends a high hill and terminates at a square fortification upon the top thereof at stanley the seat of the hon sir nich tempest bart who i am told possesses several roman coins found therein this place though not above three miles from chesterinthestreet and four from lanchester seems to have had no immediate communication with either of them no vestigia of any paved way appearing upon the moors adjoining and being situated as chester itself at the termination of a military way gives me convincing reason to believe the use of each has been the same namely to guard herds of cattle at grass for the subsistence of the two garrisons at southshields and pons aelij and for victualling ships resorting to the first place whereas had its elevated situation been intended to form a castrum exploratorium then must the advantage of paved ways to the next station have been necessary for the speedy conveyance of intelligence though this last military way bears the names of wreken dyke i am apt to believe that name is rather due to the way leading from binchester to south shields especially from the authority of ralph higden who says that wreken dyke or reken dyke passed from the west of england and ended at tinemouth i dare not affix a roman name to this our station without the authority of inscriptions   after the learned definitions given in the notes on the etymology of wreken dyke it may appear presumptuous to offer new conjectures but there is a probability that this military road was restored by the danes on their making the river tyne their frequent harbor for the more easy communication with the country and victualling their navy at their several stationary intervals where sentries were placed their standard so well known in ancient writings by the name of raffen would be displayed and it seems but a small trespass on the original word to imagine it would fall into the corruption of raken so as to make raffen dyke sound racken dyke they were the last people who it may be presumed kept this up as a military road and thence the name in acceptance in their days not having been disused by new comers has remained to our time we proposed the like etymology for the name of ravensworth much less corrupted from raffensweath the northern language and it remains with the reader to determine whether supported by each other together with the tumuli of ravensworth and maiden law the conjecture is probable or at least not altogether vague  in the road from shields to sunderland we passed through the village of westoe having several handsome buildings seated on an eminence commanding a beautiful

called the worm hill which tradition says was once possessed by an enormous serpent that wound its horrid body round the base that it destroyed much provision and used to infest the lambton estate till some hero of that family engaged it cased in armor set with razors and when it would have crushed the combatant by enfolding him sustaining a thousand wounds fell at last by his falchion we thought to have found intrenchments round this mount and that the fable had reference to some danish troop who kept the place as a station from whence they could commit depredations on the country and that the story of the hero imported some chief personages victory over a public enemy but there is not the least trace of any such matter and the whole miraculous tale has no other evidence than the

thereby it also appears that there were villain tenants of the bishop who performed their services at boldon and are there called malemen a term difficult to define the most probable conjecture we can form is that they were so styled from their rent payments which we presume were anciently made in grain and the produce of their lands for such is the construction given of maile or male by the best expositors there was a payment made in the northern counties called blackmale to those who guarded the borders against the banditti of moss troopers or perhaps the tenants of newton served as guards on the frontiers and thence were called malemen newton in bishop burys time gave a local name to a resident family and rob de newton in the fifth year of that prelate died seized of considerable

over from rome with john the precenter of st peters who was sent by pope agatho to the synod convened by the sorus and he built the monastery of weremouth becoming abbot there having a grant from the king of some lands for an endowment of the abbey he went to rome and procured the popes bull for a further security in the year   0 at his return the pope ordered john the precentor to go along with him and teach him and his monks the manner of singing used at st peters in rome john at his coming hither performed this part of his commission taught the monastery church music and pricked out a course for the choir for a whole year this manner of church music was quickly spread through most part of the kingdom of northumberland    this man labored to rome five several times for what other thing i find not save only to procure pope holy privileges and curious ornaments for his monasteries jarrow and weremouth  for first he got for these houses wherein he nourished  00 monks great liberties then brought he them home from rome painters glasiers freemasons and singers to the end that his buildinges might so shine with workmanshipe and his churches so sound with melodye that

we are informed the workmen employed in this edifice were brought by benedict from france and that within the compass of a year after the foundation was laid he caused the roof to be put on and divine service to be performed in it he continues afterward when the building was finished he sent over to france for artificers skilled in the mystery of making glass an art till that time unknown to the inhabitants of britain to glaze the windows both of the porticos and principal parts of the church which work they not only executed but taught the english nation that most useful art we are not informed in what manner the monastery was restored or by whom after the danish devastations but when king malcolm of scotland made his inroad in the year  0 0 he ravaged many parts of this palatinate and burnt the monasteries of weremouth and hartlepool we have few accounts of the ostium of the were being frequented by shipping in these early times but from the choice of situations are induced to believe what led the founders of religious houses to fix upon weremouth and jarrow was their being the station of mariners who in all ages were objects for religious reformation and yet another and perhaps not less essential cause occurs they were accustomed to present gifts for propitiation which would assist the maintenance if not increase the riches of the religious societies when malcolm made that progress he found edgar with his family and followers embarked and lying in the haven waiting wind and tide for their voyage to scotland and it is more than probable the kings intention was to cover that retreat this circumstance shows that the port was of some note in the eleventh century vide vol i p  0   scala chronica  lel col vol ii p        it is wonderful that turgot who took the monkish habit at this place should not speak of its history during so long a space of time as from the incursion of the danes to the year  0   a period of  0  years or mention the restored edifice the return of the society and the destruction made by malcolm thus dark as the long interval remains we must pursue the facts which he delivers down part of the religious society of jarrow which we are apt to conceive was become too numerous by the monks who were driven from weremouth seeking refuge there determined to form a colony with aldwin at their head and settle in the north whilst another prepared for a southern settlement headed by renfred aldwin with his followers sat down at the ruined huose of melros where they suffered much persecution refusing to swear allegiance to malcolm who then possessed that territory vide vol i p     also jarrowe  bishop walcher was displeased with this emigration which was not only made without his consent but also militated against a plan he had formed though not made public he dispatched messengers to entreat the return of the northern colony and wrote letters of invitation but in case of disobedience the messengers were charged with more rigorous commands and the terrors of excommunication were directed to be announced on aldwins return to this diocese in the year  0   the bishop placed him at weremouth turgot then tells us tunc ecclesiam s petri cujus adhuc soli parietes semiruti steterant succisis arboribus cradicatis vepribus and spinis quae totam occupaverant curarunt expurgare and culmine imposito quale hodie cernitur ad agenda divinae laudis officia stategerant restaurare ubi de virgis facientes habitacula etc symeon dunelm p  0   0  etc this relation affords some surprise for according to other authorities it was only in the year  0 0 that malcolm laid his destroying hand on those edifices and in the space of five years few trees thorns or briers could grow over the ruins lambard still creates greater confusion in the matter who says aldwyn of evesham or winchecombe as others say accompanied with two or three other took the place of bishop walchers guifte covered the church and somewhat repaired the house and stoared it with company but before they had long rested theare the destruction which william the conqueror made in the north country and the fire of malcolme king of scotts came upon them and caused them to forsake the place for a season and when they meant to have returned william then bishop of durham compelled them to come to durham abbay and made the house and cell subject to the same etc this account destroys every degree of chronology for bishop walcher did not come to the sea till  0   to solve the difficulty it seems likely there were two religious edifices one north of were destroyed by the danes of which jarrow was a filiation and another erected perhaps after that destruction on the south of were which malcolm ruined and this conjecture is not totally groundless for tanner in his notitia under the title bishopweremouth  tanners notitia p    king egfrid gave this town to the famous abbot benedict biscopius who a d     founded a monastery here and

mistake in the situation of st peters perhaps through the confusion there appears in ancient history after this last settlement the bishop gave the vill of weremouth with sudwick for the maintenance of the religious fellowship there but their residence was soon disturbed by bishop william de carilepho carrying into effect the design of his predecessor and removing the benedictine monks to durham

hall and four chambers the family of hilton was not only one of the most eminent in this province but also one of the most opulent as appears by their possessions mentioned in the notes  the following account of the hiltons is taken from a manuscript in the possession of the musgraves of hayton  three hundred years before the conquest even in the reign of king athelstan one of the saxon monarchs the family of hyltons were settled in england in great reputation as appears by a certain inscription at hartlepool that upon the coming over of william the conqueror lancelot de hylton with his two sons henry and robert espoused his cause and joined him but that lancelot was slain at feversham in kent that to the elder son henry the conqueror gave a large tract of land on the banks of the river were not far from weresmouth a reward for his own and his fathers valor that this henry built hylton castle in the year  0   was one of the deputies that treated with the conqueror concerning the four northern counties and in the service of that prince was at last slain in normandy that in the reign of edward iii john hylton who sent four of his sons into the wars of france under the command of the black prince was first created baron of hylton castle for his gallant defense of it against the scots incursions that this peerage continued in the family for seven successions till at last it was forfeited upon account of some unguarded words whereof the then bishop of durham gave the court information which william the seventh and last baron of the family spoke against the queen and her favorite de le pole that upon the death of this william which was thought to have been violent the crown seizing upon the estate gave it to the informing bishop who held it for some time to the utter exclusion of the rightful heir that in process of time however lancelot the grandson to the aforesaid william was restored to his castle and part of his estate no more of it indeed than what the bishop thought fit to allow him under this hard condition that he and his heirs for ever should hold the moiety that was given them under certain rents and services to the sec of durham and have the title of barons but barons to the bishopric annexed to their inheritance and in that condition it has continued ever since in the pedigree of the hyltons there are several names remarkable for their learning and piety but almost innumerable those highly renowned for their martial deeds war seems to have been the pleasure genius and recreation of the hyltons nor has any family been more lavish of their blood in defense of their countrys cause since the time of the conquest it is remarked of the hyltons that one was slain at feversham in kent one in normandy one at mentz in france three in the holy wars under richard i one in the same under edward i three at the battle of bourdeaux under the black prince one at agincourt two at berwick upon tweed against the scots two at the battle of st

considerable note and had its officers of distinction and police hartlepool whilst the bishop of durham had naval armaments was the  of the province where the bishop had his officers and received the fees dues and duties which in other ports were paid to the king  bishop morton desirous of encouraging the trade of sunderland in the year      granted a charter of incorporation to the burgesses and inhabitants by the title of mayor twelve aldermen and commonalty of the borough of sunderland reg hunt penes dec and cap dun  the charter states that sunderland had beyond the memory of man been an ancient borough known by the name of the new borough of weremouth containing in itself a certain part where ships had plied bringing and carrying merchandise as well to and from foreign parts as from other ports of this kingdom the articles of exportation therein specified are sea coals grindstones rubstones and whetstones it also states that the trade was then greatly increased by the multitude of ships resorting thither and that the borough anciently enjoyed diverse liberties and free customs as well by prescription as by virtue of sundry charters from the bishops of durham confirmed to them by the crown which from defect in form proved insufficient for the support of the ancient liberties privileges and free customs of the borough or to that effect this charter granted the market and fairs and appointed the mayor for the time being clerk of the market  for reasons not pointed out to us this charter was suffered to expire perhaps the miseries of those times and the dreadful convulsions of the state caused it to be neglected but though the members of the incorporation did not long preserve their jurisdiction the privileges granted to the inhabitants were assumed and maintained in several suits at law particularly touching the herbage of the townmoor with the soil thereof this common consists of about seventy or eighty acres only in the case of hicks versus clerk lev  d part p     the custom is stated that sunderland is an ancient borough consisting of twelve capital burgesses called burgesses and twelve inferior burgesses called stallingers and that each freeman occupying a house had commonage for two horses and four cows and each stallinger for one cow and that the widow of a freeman or stallinger being an inhabitant had the like commonage after the husbands death upon error the judgment establishing this custom was affirmed see a bill brought in the court of exchequer in the year      or thereabouts by sir william middleton and william etterick of barnes against william etterick of silksworth and some other people of sunderland and the depositions in the cause especially the deposition of the defendant william etterick which will show a right in the bishop of durham to sunderland townmoor and that the freemen and stallingers are only entitled to the herbage  gylls mss       june    in the court of exchequer the long contested cause

administer the oaths of supremacy and obedience to the inhabitants etc there this record was communicated by mr george pearson with a remark that it proves the burgesses accepted bishop mortons charter and that it also operates as a legal recognition of the grant of incorporation made by the bishop  he also in the twentieth year of his reign granted his letters patent to edward andrew esquire to build a pier or piers with a lighthouse or lighthouses and to cleanse the harbor of sunderland with power to raise contributions for effecting those works and the same letters patent forbid all masters and commanders of ships or other vessels to cast ballast out of their ships or vessels within six fathom water within the space and limits of one mile to the southwards and one mile to the northwards of the mouth or entrance of the harbor willing and commanding all officers and ministers of our courts of admiralty and viceadmiralty to take especial cognizance thereof and severely punish such as shall offend the letters patent state that whereas we are informed by the humble petition of our well beloved subjects the inhabitants of the borough and port of sunderland near the sea upon the river of weere in the county palatine of durham that the harbor and river there being very commodiously situate for the shiping of vast quantities of sea coals plentifully gotten and wrought there for supply of all our subjects of our realm of england who can fetch the same as also of foreign parts is of late very much gorged stopped up and choked and by the many sholes sand beds and much breach and rubbish daily increasing in the same is almost rendered innavigable so as the said harbor and river which in late years did receive and secure  00 sail of ships at one time laden with coals and other goods cannot now receive any ship of considerable burden without hazard but the ship masters merchants and cole owners are constrained in part to load such ships exporting coals and unload such ships importing other goods at sea near the mouth of the said harbor to the prejudice of our revenue of the customs and the great peril and danger of such ships and goods and those ships which are of small draught of water and may go into the said harbor do lie long there for their loadings by reason of the said shoals and sand beds in the said river obstructing the bringing down of coals and other goods for their loadings and being so laden do wait long for spring tides and winds to carry them to sea which much enhanceth the price of coals in many parts of our realm and is of hindrance to the maritime commerce and that it would be very expedient and necessary and also greatly advantageous and beneficial not only to us our heirs and successors in the advancement of our revenue of the customs and to our merchants and seafaring men in the encouragement of trade and increase of shipping and navigation but in the setting up of a convenient fishing trade there if the harbor and river belonging to the port of sunderland aforesaid were cleansed etc     the regal jurisdiction of the bishop of durham being in many instances removed by the statute of henry viii the conservatorship of the river were and port of sunderland was vested in the powers of the crown and the necessary revival of that authority became daily obvious so that an act of parliament was applied for and obtained in the  d year of k george i for the preservation and improvement of the river were and port and haven of sunderland and commissioners were appointed for twentyone years there is a power to charge any sum not exceeding   d a chaldron on the coal owner and   d on the fitters  in the act of      there is power to borrow money on the credit of those duties  by an act passed in the   d of george ii the duties were continued for a further term of    years and were afterward made perpetual  by an act  st queen anne a farthing a chaldron was granted on all coals shipped at sunderland in support of the piers of whitby and by several subsequent laws that impost was continued and an additional farthing granted to continue to june         v coal owners case      on petition to parliament    in the thirteenth year of the same reign another act was obtained entitled an act for the more effectual preservation and improvement of the river were and port and haven of sunderland etc by which additional powers were granted to the commissioners in the twentieth year of george ii another act was obtained and commissioners appointed who were empowered to survey the river so far as to a place called new bridge being chester new bridge to which place they might make it navigable and also the port haven and harbor of sunderland as the same extends from the promontory or point called souter point about two miles from sunderland bar toward the northeast and so into the sea to five fathom at low water and from thence in a supposed direct line till it fall opposite to that land called ryhope dean about two miles toward the south by subsequent laws the powers of the commissioners have been continued  in      sunderland being increased so greatly in population that it was impossible for the inhabitants to be received to the offices of the church at weremouth an act of parliament was obtained for making the town and township of sunderland a distinct parish from the parish of bishopweremouth in the preamble of which it is stated that sunderland contained six thousand souls and upwards and that a beautiful church had been erected with a vestryroom and a dwelling house for a minister or rector to live in upon a parcel of ground part of one of the common fields of sunderland and within the manor and borough of sunderland called the intack and had enclosed or doled out a parcel of ground adjoining thereto for a cemetery or churchyard by this act sunderland was made a rectory the patronage of which should for ever appertain to the bishop of durham a vestry or association of inhabitants was instituted by this act consisting of twentyfour persons having freehold estates of the yearly value of  0l to be chosen by the parishioners and to continue in office three years and so a succession to be chosen every three years in which vestrymen was vested a power to make ordinances and bylaws for the regulation of the new parish to be ratified by two justices to appoint a scavenger and to assess on estates real and personal and stock in trade a sufficient sum for the purposes therein mentioned and particularly for paying to the rector a yearly stipend of eighty pounds and to the clerk ten pounds and a competent sum to the scavenger to be levied by warrant from two or more justices of the peace the rectory to be discharged of first fruits tenths procurations and synodals but the tithes of fish and of corn and hay growing within the parish were reserved for the rectory of bishopweremouth the new rectory taking only easter reckonings surplice fees and other small dues  the trade of sunderland is very considerable in the description of england and wales page     also england displayed published by russell and owen       it is thus spoken of it is a well built populous sea port town having a fine church which the late rector mr newcomb spent the greatest part of his income in beautifying and adorning he began by building a dome adjoining to the east end into which he removed the altar placing it under a canopy of inlaid work supported in front by two fluted columns of the corinthian order but this gentleman died before he had finished his intended improvements from the coal trade the inhabitants derive great wealth the coal is so remarkable for burning slow that it is said to make three fires the port was formerly so shallow that ships were obliged to take in their lading in the open road which was sometimes attended with very great danger to the keelmen who bring the coals down to the ships on this account the vessels which loaded here were usually smaller than in the neighboring ports but as they ride in the open sea they no sooner get in their lading than they are ready to sail which is a considerable advantage as they have been known to steer from thence to deliver their coals at london to beat up against the wind in their return and to get back before the ships at shields which were laden before them had been able to get over the bar but this inconvenience has been in a great measure removed the town is much improved and increased within these fifty years the principal street is of great length and of considerable breadth parallel to which runs another but narrower besides a great number of others the town with the adjacent hamlets of bishopweremouth bishopweremouth saltpans monkweremouth and the north shore side contain about twenty thousand inhabitants those who are delighted with sea prospects may here see twenty or thirty sail of ships coming in with a flowing tide from the coasting and foreign parts fifteen or twenty going out on their respective voyages and thirty or forty sail at anchor in the road taking in their cargoes here is a very fine pier which affords a pleasant walk as well as shelter for the ships and is said to have cost about   000l they have also deepened the south channel by taking up part of the rock so great is the trade of sunderland that in      there belonged to this port alone about one hundred and ninety ships which are chiefly laden with coals the staple commodity of the place and the produce of the adjacent country whence many people are employed and great sums brought in in the summer season there are about ten thousand tons of lime and limestone carried from this river in small sloops of about twenty or thirty tons it is said that there were loaded at this port in           sail of ships and in the year      besides the small sloops already mentioned coasters foreign port total in the quarter ending at lady day   0        in the quarter ending at midsummer   0          in the quarter ending at michaelmas              in the quarter ending at christmas   0     0  total               this account is exactly transcribed from the customhouse books of that year and many of these ships were from one hundred to five hundred tons burden the amount of the duties of goods exported and imported from and to foreign parts com ann is about  0000l and as it is computed that about   0000 winchester chaldrons of coals are carried coastwise whereon there is a duty of five shillings a chaldron on delivery amounting to   000l the whole revenue arising to the crown from the imports exports and produce of sunderland may be reckoned about   00 l per annum so that possibly with respect to the duty arising from it it may be the sixth or at least the seventh port in the kingdom  in addition to the preceding account it is to be observed that the chief or high street of sunderland is nearly a mile in length the houses well built with brick the low street which runs parallel thereto and adjoins upon the quay is narrow and extremely populous there are some new streets which run from the upper side of the high street containing several elegant buildings in regard to the population in the year      there were    burials in bishopweremouth which being multiplied by  0 the average number which has been found on general calculations of dths in this county would make the number of souls in weremouth and sunderland    0 the number of burials in weremouth in the year      was     and in sunderland     which on the like calculation will give   0 0 to which if we add    0 for monkweremouth the whole number of souls will be  0  0 by the above account it appears the increase in population in one century was not less than     0 souls the pier which was erected at the mouth of the river in the coal owners case in      before referred to on the   st of december      had cost

the town are two handsome seat houses one the seat of mr thornhill called thornhill the other hynden lodge built by  maling esquire  authors have made various conjectures touching the derivation of the name of sunderland some insisting it is the ancient saxon sonderland signifying a particular precinct with privileges of its own others that the name is expressive of a peninsula severed and separated from the main land and this latter appears the most probable for we see by the ancient records that in bishop hatfields time hynden was a place held by thomas menvyll for the plying of ships vide exemplum an    ed        thomas menvill occupavit quend locum ibidem vocat hindon pro aedificando naves and solvit pro inde episc annual redditum  s  vide spearmans inq  it was the custom in those days to build their barks in creeks etc    if the sea in the beginning of the fourteenth century formed a creek or bay there the land on which sunderland now stands would at high water be almost totally dissevered from the main and the deep gulleys show a probability that such was the case the shore has greatly changed its figure in the course of four hundred years and perhaps some art was used to exclude the sea from that course when the haven of sunderland grew into fame and the coal trade began upon were  this town has been honored by our kings in giving title of earl to several noble families viz emanuel lord scroope of bolton who having been first made president of the kings council in the north by king james i the  th of february      was by his son charles i created earl of sunderland the   th of june      but dying without lawful issue the same king created henry lord spencer of wormleighton in respect to his approved loyalty and adherence to him in the civil wars then on foot earl of sunderland but he enjoyed his honor a small time being slain the same year at the battle of newbury leaving a son robert earl of sunderland who died in   0  and was succeeded by charles earl of sunderland  having treated of sunderland we must return to those members of the parish of weremouth which are still retained bainbriggholme lies a little to the south of weremouth town

lower part of the town it is in the form of a cross with the tower in the center the chancel is in length fourteen paces to the steps which ascend to the communion table and within the rail four paces the width six paces it was some years ago wainscotted and stalled on each side probably by mr davenport for on the north side is a shield bearing the arms of bishop houghton hall view of houghton hall cousin and on the south side another bearing the arms of davenport the wainscot being much decayed was removed by the present rector and the chancel is now fitted up with plaster in an elegant style the stalls too being much decayed have been repaired the east window consisting of five lights is under a pointed arch there are beside five other windows in the chancel one of four lights under a flat arch three under pointed arches divided by a small pilaster and an adjoining one under a flat arch the tower stands on four columns giving an interior square of six paces opening on every side to form the cross and lead to the four limbs of the building the nave is twentyfour paces in length from the pillars of the square and has regular ailes formed by rows of three uniform clustered columns supporting pointed arches which at the western extremity spring from pilasters of similar form with the pillars the whole having great symmetry and being of beautiful architecture the width of the nave with its ailes is twelve paces the side lights are regular four on each side and modern the west window consists of five lights under a pointed arch the reading desk is placed against the north west corner pillar and the pulpit opposite to it there is at present in agitation a plan for rebuilding the stalls and seating the church many of which are now ruinous and much decayed for removing the old organ and introducing a new one in a gallery to be erected against the north wall of the church the organ is placed in the south limb of the cross the windows at the extremities of the cross are under pointed arches one limb of this cross but whether the north or south we cannot ascertain is called trinity porch the nave is ceiled and stuccoed and very clean  there were two guilds

of march anno domini          the reader perhaps expects some short anecdotes in this place of that excellent man bernard gilpin we have selected several particulars given by william gilpin a m of queens college oxford and others his biographers  bernard gilpin descended from a good family in westmoreland was born at kentmire in that county in the year      his fathers elder brother was slain in the battle of bosworth field being heir in the fifth descent to richard gilpin who in the reign of king john was enfeoffed in the lordship of kentmirehall by the baron of kendal for his singular services  from his earliest youth he was inclined to a contemplative life was thoughtful reserved and serious his first years were spent at a public grammar school from whence at the age of sixteen he was removed to oxford and entered upon the foundation at queens college he applied himself closely to his studies and made a considerable proficiency in the learning of the times having determined to study divinity that he might read the scriptures he set out with great industry to gain a thorough knowledge of the greek and hebrew languages in which he was much assisted by mr neal a fellow of new college and afterward professor of hebrew in oxford  at the usual term he took the degree of master of arts and about the same time was elected fellow of his college but shortly after on account of his learning was made choice of among those who were appointed to supply the college newly founded by cardinal wolsey and to which he was accordingly removed  as mr gilpin was bred in the roman catholic religion he continued a considerable time steady to that church and in defense thereof held a disputation against hooper afterward bishop of worcester in the reign of henry viii but when edward vi mounted the throne peter martyr went to oxford and there read divinity lectures in a strain to which the university had been little accustomed mr gilpins credit in the university was become considerable the popish party were therefore very solicitous to engage him to side publicly with them and when they made the most pressing applications to him for that purpose they found his zeal much cooler than their own he was not indeed satisfied with the reformers having had few opportunities of making himself acquainted with their arguments but on the other hand he never was bigoted in his religion while his mind was in so unsettled a condition he thought himself but ill qualified to espouse either side publicly such importunity was however used with him that at length he yielded and appeared next day against peter martyr  mr gilpin entered into the controversy against his inclination he resolved to lay aside as much as possible the temper of a caviller and to place truth before him as the sole object of his pursuit from which he was determined not to be drawn aside either by prejudice or novelty the disputation was therefore soon over for mr gilpin had nothing of that pride of heart which leads men to defend suspected opinions but gave up his cause with that grace which always attends sincerity he owned publicly that he could not maintain it and determined to enter into no more controversies till he gained full information of the subject peter martyr took notice of this difference of behavior and frequently said that he was not much troubled either for weston morgan or the rest gilpins fellow disputants but as for that gilpin said he i am very much moved concerning him for he does and speaks all things with an upright heart the rest seem to me to be men who are carried away as it were with every blast of ambition and covetousness but gilpin resting firmly upon gravity and manners and the testimony of a most laudable life seems to honor with his own goodness the cause which he undertaketh martyr would likewise tell his friends that it was the subject of his daily prayers that god would be pleased to touch the heart of this pious priest with the knowledge of true religion    he communicated some of his doubts to bishop tunstall who was his mothers uncle and had always expressed great regard for him and also conferred with dr redman dr j redman or redmayne was nearly related to bishop tunstall and eminently distinguished for his learning the interests of which he greatly promoted at cambridg by his influence and example mr ascham in his schoolmaster says at cambridge in st johns college in my time i do know that not so much the good statutes as two gentlemen of worthy memory sir john cheke and dr redman by their own example of excellency in learning of godliness in living of diligence in studying of council in exhorting by good order in all things did breed up so many learned men in that one college of st johns at one time as i believe the whole university of louvain in many years was never able to afford    of whose virtue and learning he had formed an high opinion  as an academic life afforded the most leisure for study so mr gilpin was most inclined thereto he had too just a sense of the duty of a clergyman to be unacquainted with the qualifications requisite for its discharge and too mean an opinion of himself to think he was yet master of them he judged more learning was necessary in that controversial age than he had yet acquired and his chief argument with his friends who were continually soliciting him to leave the university was that he was not yet sufficiently instructed in religion himself to be a teacher of it to others these thoughts continued him at oxford till the thirtyfifth year of his age but about that time the vicarage of norton in the diocese of durham falling vacant his friends prevailed upon him to accept it though not without much difficulty accordingly a presentation passed in november      but before he took possession of his benefice he was appointed to preach before king edward vi who then resided at greenwich sir william cecil having obtained for him a general license for preaching  mr gilpin having staid some time in london repaired to his parish and immediately entered upon the duties of his function he failed not as occasions offered to use the kings license in other parts of the country but his own parish he considered as the place where his chief care was due here he made it his principal endeavor to inculcate moral virtue and to dissuade from those vices which he observed most prevalent he seldom handled controverted points being afraid lest endeavoring to instruct he might mislead at length he thought he had engaged too soon in his office and that he could not properly discharge the duties of it his mind was not satisfied whilst he merely gave his hearers moral instructions overspread as the country was with disputed articles of faith and he conceived he acted improperly in pretending to be a teacher of religion if he was unable to oppose the prevalent errors these thoughts made every day a greater impression upon him and at length growing quite unhappy he wrote an account of his situation of mind to bishop tunstall who was then in the tower the prelate thereupon advised mr gilpin to provide a trusty curate for his parish and to spend a year or two in germany france and holland by which means he might have an opportunity of conversing with some of the most eminent professors both protestants and papists this advice gave gilpin much satisfaction for a conference with some of the learned men abroad was what he had long earnestly desired his principal objection to the scheme was that it would prove too expensive but as to that tunstall wrote to him that his living would do something toward his maintenance and he would supply deficiences this however did not remove the difficulty mr gilpins notions of clerical duty were so strict that he thought no excuse could justify nonresidence for so considerable a time as he intended to be abroad he could not therefore think of supporting himself with any part of the income of his living he was determined to go abroad and resolved if he staid the shorter time to rely only upon his own frugal management of the little money he had and to leave the rest to the bishops generosity accordingly he resigned his living in favor of a worthy man with whose abilities and character he was well acquainted and then set out for london to receive his last orders from the bishop and to embark the account of his resignation got to town before him and gave tunstall who was anxious for his kinsmans thriving in the world great concern here are your friends said he endeavoring to provide for you and you are taking every method to frustrate their wishes but be warned by these courses you will presently bring yourself to a morsel of bread mr gilpin begged the bishop would attribute what he had done to a scrupulous conscience which would not permit him to act otherwise  before he took leave of the bishop the latter put into mr gilpins hands a treatise he had written upon the eucharist desiring he would cause it to be printed under his inspection at paris soon after which he embarked for holland and upon his landing went immediately to mechlin to visit his brother george who was at that time pursuing his studies there but after a few weeks he went to louvain where he resolved to settle for some time he made frequent excursions to antwerp ghent brussels and other places in the low countries where he spent some weeks with men of reputation who held both sides of the controversial tenets but he made louvain his chief place of residence for which city he always expressed a more than common affection louvain was then one of the most distinguished places for students in divinity some eminent divines on both sides of the question resided there and the most important topics of religion were discussed with great freedom  mr gilpins first business there was to get himself introduced to those of eminence for learning to whom his own address and seize were no mean recommendations he was present at all public readings and disputations committed every thing material to writing reexamined all his opinions proposed his doubts in private to his friends and in every respect made the best use of his time  whilst he was thus prosecuting his studies he and the protestants in those parts were alarmed with the melancholy news of the death of king edward the unsuccessful attempt in favor of lady jane and the accession of queen mary but it came attended with one agreeable circumstance an account of bishop tunstalls release from the tower and reestablishment in his bishopric soon afterward mr gilpin received a letter from his brother george entreating him to come to mechlin to confer on an affair of importance on his arrival he found his brother had received a letter from the bishop informing him that he had found a benefice of considerable value vacant in his diocese which he wished he could persuade his brother bernard to accept imagining he might by this time have got over his former scruples and accordingly george used his utmost endeavors for this purpose but without effect bernard continuing inflexible in his resolution not to accept of any benefice without discharging the duties of it he therefore returned to louvain but however thought it incumbent on him to give the bishop his reasons for not accepting his kind offer the bishop was not offended at this letter for the unaffected piety of it disarmed all resentment and led him rather to admire a behavior in which the motives of conscience showed themselves so superior to those of interest  mr gilpin continued some time longer at louvain daily improving in religious knowledge but while he staid in the low countries he was greatly affected with the melancholy sight of crowds of his dejected countrymen arriving daily in those parts to avoid the bloody persecution then carrying on in england it gave him however some pleasure to find though he was unable personally to assist them yet his acquaintance in the country furnished him with the means of being useful to many of them by his recommendations  when he had been about two years in flanders he left louvain and went to paris where his first care was printing the bishops book which he performed entirely to his satisfaction during his stay at paris he lodged with vascosan an eminent printer to whom he had been recommended by his friends in the netherlands this learned man showed him great regard did him many friendly offices and introduced him to the most considerable persons in the city  mr gilpin having spent three years abroad returned into england in      whilst the persecution was still carrying on against the protestants bishop tunstall received his kinsman with great kindness and soon after his arrival gave him the archdeaconry of durham to which the rectory of easington was annexed he immediately repaired to his parish where he preached with great boldness against the vices errors and corruptions of the times and by virtue of his office of archdeacon he also took great pains to reform the manners of the clergy his free reproofs soon roused the ecclesiastics of those parts against him and put them upon every method in their power to remove so inconvenient an enquirer the popular clamor amongst them was that gilpin was an enemy to the church a scandalizer of the clergy and a preacher of false doctrines and that religion must suffer from the heresies he was daily uttering if he was suffered any longer some found great fault for that i preached repentance and salvation by christ and did not make whole sermons as they did about transubstantiation purgatory holy water images prayers to saints and such like  an account of the family of

short a charge of heresy consisting of thirteen articles was drawn up against him and he was accused in form before the bishop of durham but tunstall who was much practiced in the world easily found a method of dismissing the cause in such a manner as to protect his nephew without endangering himself the malice of his enemies could not rest and they created him so much trouble that not being able to undergo the fatigue of duty he begged leave of the bishop to resign either the archdeaconry or his parish which his lordship thought fit to which the bishop answered that the income of the former was not a support without the latter and that he could not consent to their being separated upon this mr gilpin resigned both of them but the bishop soon after presented him with the rectory of houghtonlespring  this extensive rectory containing no less than fourteen villages had been as much neglected in that dark age as the cures in the north then generally were all ancient customs and ceremonies were carried higher than in most other places and were considered as the essentials of religion and it is said through the designed neglect of bishops and justices of the peace king edwards proclamations for a change of worship had not even been heard of in this part of the kingdom at the time of that princes death  such was the condition of the parish of houghton when it was committed to the care of mr gilpin described by his biographers and other writers to be then a waste so miserably uncultivated that the greatest industry seemed necessary to bring it into any kind of order and the greatest resolution was requisite in the attempt but when the good of mankind was concerned this true christian minister had resolution to attempt whatever industry could accomplish he was grieved to see ignorance and vice prevail but he did not despair the people crowded about him and heard him with great attention perceiving him to be a teacher of a very different kind from those to whom they had been accustomed  when mr gilpin took possession of houghton he found the parsonagehouse gone so to decay that he could not reside in it part of it was sitted up as soon as possible for his reception but he continued improving and enlarging it till it became suitable to his hospitable temper a proper habitation for a man who never intended to keep what he had to himself soon after his acceptance of the rectory of houghton tunstall urged him to accept of a stall then vacant in the cathedral church of durham telling him that there lay not the same objection to this as to the archdeaconry it being quite a sinecure and therefore he would have no reasonable pretense for refusing it but mr gilpin unwilling to accept it told the bishop that by his bounty he had already more wealth than he was afraid he should give a good account of he begged therefore he might not have an additional charge but that his lordship would rather bestow this preferment on one by whom it was more wanted  mr gilpin now lived in a retired manner and gave no immediate offense to the clergy the experience he had of their temper made him more reserved indeed he used more caution than he could afterward approve for in his future life he would often tax his behavior at this time with weakness and cowardice but all his caution was ineffectual for he was soon formally accused before the bishop of durham who again found means to protect him the malice of his enemies succeeded in part for tunstalls favor from this time visibly declined and he struck him out of his will of which he had before made him the executor this loss gave mr gilpin little concern he was sorry indeed to see the bishop disgusted he acknowledged his great obligations to him and would have given up any thing to have him satisfied except his conscience but good conscience he was assured was his best friend and he was resolved not to part with it for any mortal friend upon earth  his enemies in the mean time were not thus silenced enraged at this second defeat they caused thirtytwo articles to be drawn up against him in the strongest manner and laid before bonner bishop of london here they went the right way to work bonner was a man suited to their purpose and accordingly gave immediate orders for his apprehension mr gilpin being no stranger to the burning zeal of the bishop of london had no sooner notice of the persecution than he prepared for martyrdom he caused a long garment to be provided that he might go in the more decent manner to the stake and set out for london in his way thither he broke his leg which put a stop for some time to his journey the persons in whose custody he was it is said took occasion from thence maliciously to retort upon him an observation that he would frequently make that nothing happens unto us but what is intended for our good asking him whether he thought his broken leg was so intended he answered meekly he made no question but it was and indeed so it proved in the strictest sense for before he was able to travel queen mary died and he was set at liberty whether all the particulars of this story are true or not thus much however is certain that the account of the queens death met him upon the road and put a stop to any further prosecution  mr gilpin being thus providentially rescued from his enemies returned to houghton through crowds of people expressing the utmost joy and blessing god for his deliverance the following year he lost his friend and relation bishop tunstall but he soon experienced that worth like his would naturally procure friends when the popish bishops were deprived the earl of bedford recommended him to queen elizabeth for the bishopric of carlisle and took care that a conge delire should be sent down to the dean and chapter for that purpose but mr gilpin declined this promotion and when much pressed to assign his reasons for refusing it he said that if any other bishopric but carlisle had been offered to him he possibly might have accepted it but in that diocese said he i have so many friends and acquaintance of whom i have not the best opinion that i must either connive at many irregularities or draw upon myself so much hatred that i should be less able to do good there than any one else mr gilpin persisting in his refusal the bishopric was at length given to dr best the year after he had an offer made him of the provostship of queens college in oxford which he likewise declined  in the mean time gilpin continued to reside at houghton discharging the duties of his function in the most exemplary manner when he first took upon himself the care of a parish he laid it down as a maxim to do all the good in his power there and accordingly his whole conduct was only one straight line drawn to this point he set out with making it his endeavor to gain the affections of his parishioners many of his papers show how material a point he considered this to succeed in it however he used no servile compliances he studied that his means should be good as well as his end his behavior was free without levity obliging without meanness and insinuating without art he condescended to the weak bore with the passionate and complied with the scrupulous and in a truly apostolic manner became all things to all men by these means he gained upon his neighbors and convinced them how heartily he was their friend  to his humanity and courtesy he added an unwearied application to the instruction of those under his care he was not satisfied with the advice he gave in public but used to teach in private and brought his parishioners to come to him with their doubts and difficulties he had a most engaging manner toward those whom he thought welldisposed nay his very reproof was so conducted that it seldom gave offense the becoming gentleness with which it was urged made it always appear the effect of friendship thus with unceasing assiduity did he employ himself in admonishing the vicious and encouraging the welldisposed by which means in a few years he made a greater change in his neighborhood than could well have been imagined a remarkable instance what reformation a single man may effect when he has the pious purpose earnestly at heart  but his hopes were not so much in the present generation as in the succeeding it was an easier task he found to prevent vice than to correct it to form the young to virtue than to amend the bad habits of the old he employed much of his time therefore in endeavoring to improve the minds of the younger part of his parish suffering none to grow up in ignorance of their duty but pressing it as the wisest part to mix religion with their labor and amidst the cares of this life to have a constant eye upon the next he attended to every thing which he conceived might be of service to his parishioners he was assiduous to prevent all law suits his hall it is said was often thronged with people who came to submit their differences to his judgment he was not much acquainted with law but could decide equitably and that satisfied nor could his sovereigns commission have given him more weight than his own character his hospitable manner of living was the admiration of the whole country he spent in his family every fortnight forty bushels of corn twenty bushels of malt and a whole ox besides a proportionable quantity of other kinds of provision strangers and travelers found in his house a cheerful reception all were welcome that came and even their horses had so much care taken of them that it was humorously said if a horse was turned loose in any part of the country it would immediately make its way to the rector of houghtons  every sunday from michaelmas till easter was a sort of public day with him during this season he expected to see all his parishioners and their families for their reception he had three tables well covered the first was for gentlemen the second for husbandmen and farmers and the third for day laborers this piece of hospitality he never omitted even at seasons when its continuance was rather difficult to him he thought it his duty and that was a deciding motive when he was absent from home no alteration was made in his family expenses the poor were fed as usual and his neighbors entertained and he was always glad of the company of men of merit and learning who greatly frequented his house  when lord burleigh then lord treasurer was sent by queen elizabeth to transact some affairs in scotland that celebrated statesman resolved on his return to pay a visit to mr gilpin amidst the hurry of this journey he could not resist the desire of seeing a man whose name was every where so respectfully mentioned his free discourse from the pulpit to king edwards court had early recommended him to this noble person from which time the great distance between them had wholly interrupted their acquaintance lord burleighs return was so sudden that he had no time to give any notice of his intended visit but the economy of so plentiful a house as mr gilpins was not easily disconcerted he received his noble guest with so much politeness and treated him and his whole retinue in so affluent a manner that the treasurer would often say he could hardly have expected more at lambeth  while lord burleigh staid at houghton he took great pains to acquaint himself with the order and regularity with which every thing was managed the house contained a very large family and was besides continually crowded with persons of all kinds gentlemen scholars workmen farmers and poor people yet there was never any confusion every one was conducted to a proper apartment and entertained directed or relieved as his particular business required he could not but please this wise lord who was so well acquainted with the effects of order and regularity in the highest sphere to observe them even in this humble one here too he saw true simplicity of manners and every social virtue regulated by exact prudence the statesman began to unbend and he could scarcely avoid comparing with a kind of envious eye the unquiet scenes of vice and vanity at which he was frequently present with the calmness of this amiable retreat at length with reluctance he took his leave and with all the warmth of affection embracing his much respected friend told him he had heard great things in his commendation but had now seen what far exceeded all that he had heard if added he mr gilpin i can ever be of any service to you at court or elsewhere use me with all freedom as one you may depend on when he had got to raintonhill which rises about a mile from houghton and commands the vale he turned his horse to take once more a view of the place and having kept his eye fixed upon it for some time his reverie broke out into this exclamation there is the enjoyment of life indeed who can blame that man for not accepting a bishopric what does he want to make him greater or happier or more useful to mankind  mr gilpin continued to discharge the duties of his ministerial office in the most conscientious benevolent and laborious manner but notwithstanding all this painful industry and the large scope it had in so extended a parish he thought the sphere of his benevolence yet too confined it grieved him to see in the adjacent parishes so much ignorance and superstition occasioned by the shameful neglect of the pastoral care in the clergy of those parts he was induced to supply as far as he was able what was wanting in others for this purpose every year he regularly visited the most neglected parishes in northumberland yorkshire cheshire westmoreland and cumberland and that his own parish in the mean time might not suffer he was at the expense of a constant assistant in each place he stayed two or three days and his method was to call the people about him and lay before them in as plain a way as possible the danger of leading wicked or even careless lives explaining to them the nature of true religion instructing them in the duties they owed to god their neighbor and themselves and showing them how greatly a moral and religious conduct would contribute to their present as well as future happiness  as mr gilpin had all the warmth of an enthusiast though under the direction of a very calm and sober judgment he never wanted an audience even in the wildest parts where he roused many to a sense of religion who had contracted the most inveterate habits of inattention to every thing of a serious nature wherever he came he used to visit the gaols and places of consinement few in the kingdom having at that time any appointed minister and by his labors and affectionate manner of behavior is said to have reformed many very abandoned persons in those places he likewise employed his interest for criminals whose cases were attended with any hard circumstances and often procured pardons  redesdale and tinedale in northumberland of all barbarous places in the north were at that time looked upon to be the most barbarous before the union the common theater where the scots and english were continually acting their bloody scenes inhabited by a kind of desperate banditti rendered fierce and active by constant rapine warfare and alarms they lived by theft and used to plunder on both sides of the barrier in this dreadful country where no man would then even travel that could help it mr gilpin never failed to spend some part of the year he generally chose the christmas holidays for this journey because he found the people at that season disengaged and most easily assembled he had set places for preaching which were regularly attended if he came where there was a church he made use of it if not of barns or any other large building where crowds of people were sure to follow him some for his instructions and others for his charity  the disinterested pains he took among those barbarous people and the good offices he was always ready to do them drew from them the warmest and sincerest expressions of gratitude indeed he was little less than adored among them one instance that is related shows how greatly he was revered by the carelessness of his servant his horses were one day stolen the news was quickly propagated and every one expressed the highest indignation at the fact the thief was rejoicing over his prize when by the report of the country he found whose horses he had taken terrified at what he had done he instantly came trembling back confessed the fact and returned the horses  we have already spoken of mr gilpins generous and hospitable manner of living the value of his rectory was about four hundred pounds a year an income at that time very considerable but yet in appearance very unproportionate to the generous things he did indeed he could not have done them unless his frugality had been equal to his generosity his friends therefore wondered to find him amidst his many great and continual expenses entertaining the design of building and endowing a grammar school a project however which his exact economy soon enabled him to accomplish though the expense of it amounted to upwards of five

the following material parts must suffice  when the school does want a master the governors may send to mr provost of queens col ox and request him that he would procure some northern man in any wise master of art either in his own house or some other etc then follow rules for conducting the school etc and the restrictions upon the master inter all is he shall meddle with and occupy no other temporal livings etc shall let his gillietithes to the most advantage he can provided that he shall not let his tithes above three years reserving no less rent than with the rest belonging to him will make up yearly his  0l wage and also he shall not take any fine before hand and if any other livings belong to him he shall farm them forth to others that they may be no hindrance to his teaching yet if it so happen that he shall take any spiritual living then he shall not have the benefit of his school above one year after his induction then follows an order touching the masters marriage which is to be with the consent of both governors and two justices of the peace  rules concerning the usher follow in this place his election shall be wholly in the governors hands unless by special authority and direction unto the master there be power granted to him from the governors to choose etc  there shall be one play day in a week either tuesday or thursday save only certain days in the spring for the scholars to exercise their bows in matching either with themselves or strangers in the oxpasture or in houghtonmoor etc at times of breaking up the scholars must pay to their master every one a penny for ferelatoc silver and none shall be enforced to give more but upon their own good will  there shall be a register book etc which once a year shall be brought to the governors etc and then if the governors can charge the master or usher by proof or testimony of the country by the church wardens of houghton by the gentlemen of negligence in teaching of misbehaviour of breach of any statute either to punish them by fine etc or otherwise if their faults be intolerable and notorious to expel them of their livings  item there is further of the rents etc so much as will yearly find five poor scholars and three poor men or women allowing them  d a week  d over which may be divided etc    his school was no sooner opened than it began to flourish and there was so great a resort of young people to it that in a little time the town was not able to accomodate them he put himself therefore to the inconvenience of fitting up a part of his own house for that purpose where he seldom had fewer than twenty or thirty children some of these were the sons of persons of distinction whom he boarded at easy rates but the greater part were poor children whom he not only educated but clothed and maintained he was likewise at the expense of boarding in the town many other poor children several of whom he brought every year from the different parts where he preached particularly redesdale and tinedale for the maintenance of poor scholars whom he sent to the universities he yearly set apart sixty pounds this sum he always expended and often more his common allowance to each scholar was about ten pounds a year which for a sober youth was at that time a very sufficient maintenance so that he never maintained fewer than six by his will it appears that at his death he had nine upon his list whom he took care to provide for during their stay at the university  as to his school he not only placed able masters in it procured from oxford but likewise constantly inspected it himself and that encouragement might quicken the application of his boys he always took particular notice of the most forward he would call them his own scholars send for them often into his study and there instruct them himself one method used by him to fill his school was a little singular besides those whom he sent from his own school to the universities and there wholly maintained he likewise gave to others who were in circumstances to do something for themselves what farther assistance they needed by which means he induced many parents to allow their children a liberal education who otherwise would not have done it he considered himself as their proper guardian and esteemed himself bound to the public for their being made useful members of it as far as it lay in his power with this view he held a punctual correspondence with their tutors and made the youths themselves frequently write to him an account of their studies so solicitous indeed was he about them that once every year he made a journey to the universities to inspect their behavior and this uncommon care was not unrewarded for many of his scholars became ornaments to the church and exemplary instances of piety among those of note who were educated by him these three are particularly mentioned henry ayray george carleton and hugh broughton  henry ayray became afterward provost of queens college in oxford where he was in great esteem for his abilities and exemplary life  george carleton was a man of worth and learning and very deservedly promoted to the sea of chichester he published several pieces which are enumerated by anthony wood and in particular the life of his benefactor bernard gilpin  hugh broughton was a very learned man and particularly skilled in rabbinical learning broughton is said to have been so laboriously studious that unless he were prevented by something very extraordinary he studied twelve or fourteen hours and often sixteen hours a day he had a contest with theodore beza he died in      as we are told by the famous dr lightfoot who declares himself a child in comparison of this great master of hebrew and rabbinical learning and mentions an offer that was once made to him of a cardinals hat     every thursday throughout the year he caused a very large quantity of meat to be dressed wholly for the poor and every day they had what quantity of broth they wanted twentyfour of the poorest were his constant pensioners four times in the year a dinner was provided for them when they received from his steward a certain quantity of corn and a sum of money and at christmas they had always an ox divided among them  in the distant parishes where he preached as well as in his own neighborhood his generosity and benevolence were continually showing themselves particularly in the desolate parts of northumberland when he began his journey says an old manuscript life of him he would have ten pounds in his purse and at his coming home he would be twenty nobles in debt which he would always pay within a fortnight after in the gaols he visited he was not only careful to give the prisoners proper instructions but used also to purchase for them such necessaries as they wanted  of his benevolent temper the following instance is preserved one day returning home he saw in a field several people crowding together and judging something more than ordinary had happened he rode up and found that one of the horses in a team had suddenly dropped down which they were endeavoring to raise but in vain for the horse was dead the owner of it seemed much dejected with his misfortune and declaring how grievous a loss it would be to him mr gilpin bade him not to be disheartened i will let you have says he honest man that horse of mine and pointed to his servants ah master replied the countryman my pocket will not reach such a beast as that come come said mr gilpin take him take him and when i demand my money then thou shall pay me  toward the latter part of his life mr gilpin went through his duty with great difficulty his health was much impaired for the fatigue he had undergone so many years had broken his constitution thus he complains in a letter to his friend to sustain all these travels and troubles i have a very weak body subject to many diseases by the monitions whereof i am daily warned to remember death my greatest grief of all is that my memory is quite decayed my sight fails my hearing fails with other ailments more than i can well express while he was thus struggling with an advanced age and much impaired constitution there happened a very unfortunate affair which entirely distroyed his health as he was crossing the marketplace at durham an ox ran at him and pushed him down with such violence that it was imagined the bruises he received would have occasioned his death he lay long confined and though he again got abroad he never recovered the little strength he had before and continued lame as long as he lived but sickness was not the only distress which the declining years of this excellent man had to struggle with as age and infirmity began to lessen the weight and influence he once possessed the malice and opposition of his enemies prevailed more and he experienced much ingratitude and ill usage at a time when he was already sinking under a weight of cares  his pious resignation under such evils was not long exercised about the beginning of february      finding himself very weak and sensible his end must be drawing near he told his friends his apprehensions and spoke of his death with that happy composure which attends the conclusion of a good life he was soon after confined to his chamber but his senses continued perfect to the last a few days before his death he desired his friends acquaintance and dependents might be called into his chamber and being raised in his bed he addressed himself to them in a very pathetic manner earnestly exhorting them to the practice of piety and virtue he also sent far several persons who had hitherto made no good use of his advice and upon whom he imagined his dying words might have a better effect but his speech began to saulter before he had finished his exhortations the remaining hours of his life he spent in prayer and conversation with some select friends mentioning often the consolations of christianity declaring they were the only true ones and that nothing else could bring a man peace at the last he died on the  th of march      in the sixtysixth year of his age  he is described to have been tall of stature slender and hawknosed in his diet he was temperate or rather abstemious his parts were good his imagination memory and judgment lively retentive and solid his acquirements were considerable for by unwearied application he had gained so great a store of knowledge that his biographers have said he was ignorant of no part of learning at that time in esteem in languages history and divinity he particularly excelled he read poetry with a good taste and was himself according to bishop charleton no mean poet his temper was naturally warm and in his youth he sometimes gave way to passion but at length he entirely corrected that infirmity his disposition was naturally serious yet among his particular friends he was cheerful and sometimes facetious his general behavior was very affable his severity had no object but himself to others he was humble candid and indulgent he had extraordinary skill in the art of managing a fortune looking upon himself barely as a steward for other people and observing that his own desires should not exceed what calm reason could justify extravagance was considered by him as a species of injustice and amidst his employments he found leisure to look into his affairs well knowing that frugality is the support of charity his intimacies were but few for it was his endeavor as the spirit of christianity required to dilate rather than to contract his affections yet where he professed a particular friendship mr gilpin was a religious observer of its offices was the most candid interpreter of the words and actions of others where he plainly saw failings would make every possible allowance for them used to express a particular indignation at slander often saying it more deserved the gallows than theft was remarkably guarded when he spoke of others considering common fame as the falsest medium and a mans reputation as his most valuable property ever displayed the greatest sincerity as well as humility in his transactions with others but the principal virtues and distinguishing parts of his character were his conscientious discharge of the ministerial office extensive benevolence and exalted piety the constant tenor of his life was so uniformly agreeable to the strictest rules of morality and religion that it gained him among his contemporaries the title of the northern apostle in his charitable distributions he had no measure but the bounds of his income of which the least portion was always laid out on himself was the more particularly careful to give away in his life time whatever could be saved for the poor as he had often seen and regretted the abuse of posthumous charities it is my design at my departure said he writing to a friend to leave no more behind me than what will serve to bury me and pay my debts what little remained he left wholly to the poor except a few slight tokens of remembrance bequeathed to his friends his uncommon benevolence made him deservedly styled the father of the poor in the rebellion of the earl of westmoreland mr gilpin retired to oxford and in his absence the rebels who had possessed durham scattered themselves as far as houghton and seized his barns and cattle the chief of the plunderers

intended to be a considerable benefactor to this alms house but finding his death approaching and wishing to avoid the interference of the mortmain act he desisted from his purpose of bequeathing a legacy to this and other charitable uses in his parish and determined to leave his estate to a near relation miss dorothy spearman of durham with a paper containing hints of the several charities he had in view but drawing up his will himself without the help of a person skilled in the law it appeared that miss spearman had only her life in the estate and that it would pass at her decease to mr sharps heir at law this induced miss spearman upon considering his several intended charities and finding those to the alms house to be the most useful and considerable with  generosity immediately to

remains were miraculously staid on the return from ripon previous to the settlement at durham in that place were noted the uncertain evidence of ancient writers and we presumed to give an opinion that wardon was not the place pointed out by the writers of antiquity those who treat of our church history do not mention that any particular veneration was paid to the saints resting place till the time of prior hugh of darlington who built a camera a hall and chapel at wardelau or wadele wardon was from very early times part of the possessions of the sea but never of the convent so that the prior had no right to enter therein and build a lodge or hall for the use of the cloister the hill of wardon is a considerable eminence rising gradually from all sides but toward the east where it is more steep there are no remains of buildings to be discovered on any part of it the similitude of name to that of the place mentioned by old writers has led to the error but if we consider the names wardon and wardona we shall be led into two probable conjectures touching their etymology either that the eminence commanding an extensive prospect by sea and land was the station of the warden of the north in some conflicts with the danes or scots and was called the wardens law or mount or that this being a mark and guide for sailors when the small vessels of the ancients kept close under the shores and for want of the compass dared not in dark weather to trust themselves to an open and stormy sea it was the point of view which struck the eye on passing the promontory of flamborough or souter point and guided to the mouth of the river were gaining thereby the name of weredun or the hill of were it is left to the reader to judge of these conjectures we having discovered no degree of evidence to support the tradition that by miraculous interposition here began the leading events which were to aggrandize the present city of durham  we find little in the records of the sea touching east and west rainton they being chiefly the possessions of the convent of durham bishop bainbrigg granted to prior thomas and the convent rot b no     free warren in rainton park bishop fordham gave them

rude scene of the austerities of st godric who carried them to the most senseless extravagance a sober mind may even at present be affected with horror at the prospect from the summits of the cliffs into a darksome and stupendous chasm rendered still more tremendous by the roaring of the waters over its distant bottom the house and adjacent grounds are situated on an eminence on three sides washed by the river and toward the east bounded by deep dells filled with stately forest trees the southern side of this peninsula is laid out in pleasure grounds one wide and extended terrace runs along the summit of the cliffs another at their feet from the upper terrace fine openings in the wood afford prospects of the adjacent lands and in one point of view you look down upon the solemn vale scattered with the ruins of the monastery and abbey the lower terrace is formed on the shelves of the rocky shore from whence the cliffs rise perpendicular near an hundred feet crowned with hanging oaks which strike their roots into the fissures of the rock and stretch a solemn umbrage over the walk from this terrace the ruins of the religious edifice appear in all their majestic beauties shut in by rising grounds fringed with woods the river falls over a rocky channel in troubled streams and the murmurs of the waters are repeated by a soothing echo for religious contemplation recluse piety and selfdenial never was place better adapted much pity it was ever disgraced by unmeaning severity and hypocrisy various are the beautiful scenes this walk affords description is languid to visit the place is the only means of forming ideas of its picturesque excellencies proceeding along the eastern side of the eminence the walk is carried on the summit of a deep and wooded dell which relieves the eye for some time before you enter upon the northern rocks which are shaken rugged and truly august mighty volumes hang over your head as if the wind which shook the oaks would rend the precipice and tumble it into the vale several deep grottos formed by nature are shadowed with trees suspended from their roof hasty streams fall from the cliffs and with a hollow clamor increase the pleasing solemnity of the vast scene the river forms a canal near a mile in length through an avenue of rocks and hanging forests the spire of chester church the terminating object the woods are noble consisting chiefly of oaks of a great age nature has lavished beauties on this place and what art has done with an excellent taste has smoothed her brow where art was wanted and opened to the eye those beauties her wildness would otherwise have concealed in the time of bishop galfrid one aellafus a priest gave coken to the church of durham this is to be understood only of part of the territory

deficient in that richness which is so pleasing in the valleys further from the ocean the church is small and without ailes there are two table monuments in the chancel one with a recumbent effigy in

rocks and shoals so that in stormy weather it is tremendous to mariners whilst the heavy breaker shakes the sounding coast in the mouth of a deep and narrow creek where the rocks are the most broken rugged and romantic admiral milbanke built a summer retreat which he called sailors hall at high tide it almost hangs over the waves and looks upon the most stormy and shaken part of the shore the placidness of a summer evenings calm when the moon is reflected on the smooth bosom of the ocean is highly pleasing to the contemplative eye but when the storm lifts the distracted waves with a horrid gloom confounds the elements and mixes the spray even with the clouds when the winds groan in the caverns and the hoarse billows thunder along the beach when the shrill cries of distress and wreck strike the ear from wretches without succor when the affrighted cattle bellowing leave the hills and driving showers sweep the disconsolate landscape little remains to make such a situation eligible

and his sisters mary and martha shyrburne  clarus sons lat lel  scyreburna saxon  here is an hospital of poor men which hugh puteac the joly bishop of durham builded in the reign of k hen ii  lambardes topog dict p      our saxon ancestors dedicated many buildings to what they esteemed pious and very few to charitable uses solely bishop tanner has not noticed so many as six established by them but we ought not to conclude from this omission that they were regardless of their fellow creatures laboring under the various calamities incident to human nature who were unable to help themselves in general the poor were supported by the religious societies and the members of each were enjoined by the rules of their respective orders and the express directions of their founders and benefactors to relieve the wants and distresses not only of the necessitous and infirm in their neighborhood but of traveling people also from neglect or the nauseousness and infection of diseases the wretchedness of the poor would perhaps not be sufficiently relieved which induced the benevolent to found hospitals for the more immediate and greater relief of distempered objects within  00 years after the conquest    hospitals were erected in this kingdom and before the end of the reign of henry iii they were increased to      the leprosy was a disorder very prevalent in europe during the tenth and eleventh centuries and its spreading was doubtless the cause of establishing many hospitals some persons have conjectured that in christendom they amounted to   000 in number but without assenting to so vague a calculation it is certain that in england there was hardly a large city or a capital town near which there was not one at least of these lazarhouses erected we indeed find none within the walls for as the distemper was so violent as to be judged infectious the afflicted persons were denied all public commerce  hospitals were originally designed for the relief and entertainment of travelers upon the road and particularly of pilgrims and therefore were generally built by the wayside  burns eccl law vol ii p      from the situation of sherburn hospital we may conjecture that it was partly intended for this benevolent purpose as well as for the reception of lepers  the leprosy was much more common in this part of the globe formerly than at present and perhaps near half the hospitals that were in england were for lepers at the five gates of norwich were five houses of this sort and lepers were so numerous in the twelfth century that by a decree in the lateran council under pope alexander iii      they were empowered to erect churches for themselves and to have their own ministers lepers we may suppose to officiate in them this shows at once how infectious and offensive their distemper was and on this account in england where a man was a leper and dwelling in a town and would come into the church or among his neighbors where they were assembled to talk with them to their annoyance or disturbance a writ lay de leproso amovendo  fitzh not brev p   0      what follows is remarkable the writ is for those lepers who appear to the sight of all men that they are lepers by their voice and their sores the putrefaction of their flesh and by the smell of them and so late as the reign of edw vi multitudes of lepers seem to have been in england for in   edw vi c   in which directions are given for carrying the poor to the places where they were born etc we read the following clause provided always that all leprous and poor bedrid creatures may at their liberty remain and continue in such houses appointed for lepers or bedrid people as they now be in  burns hist poor laws p     in the reign of hen i the leprosy by some called elephantiasis ran by infection all over england and it is believed that the disease first came into this island out of egypt which more than once had spread itself into europe first in the days of pompey the great afterward under heraclius and at other times as may be seen in history but never so far as i have read did it before that time appear in england  camd brit leicestersh p     edit

divinity and one of the senior fellows of trinity college in cambridge and this year head lecturer in that house but because the living chiefly consists upon husbandry and he a mere scholar i was content at his suite to bestow that hospital upon dr bellamy an honest man a preacher and a physician to have charge both of the souls and bodies of the poor impotent sick persons of that hospital and dr bellamy to give over one of his benefices and his prebend in durham to mr hutton this was done in november and the beginning of december last for after i did receive a letter from mr secretary that her majestys intention was to qualify sir henry lee with a dispensation and to bestow upon him the said house i did answer that i being patron by statute whereunto her majesty had given her royal assent with best advice had already given it as fully and effectually as i could so the matter slept from that time until the beginning of march when i did receive to my great grief another letter from mr secretary that her highness was greatly offended with me for the bestowing of it because i knowing her majestys determination had presumed to bestow it without her leave i answer that which was most true as i shall answer before the living god that i had given it before mr secretarys letter signifying her majestys pleasure did come unto my hands and that i did it with the testimony of a good conscience to bring into this ignorant country two godly preachers by two benefices which dr bellamy did resign but this week i did receive a third letter from mr secretary signifying that he had acquainted her majesty with my answer wherewith her highness was nothing satisfied but that her majestys resolution was that i should restore dr bellamy to all his former livings and he to give over the hospital and that i should send up forthwith to the court mr hutton to compound with sir henry lee for the hospital and then he to have the same which thing if it please your good lordship lies not in me to do for i am not patron of all dr bellamys livings and he refuses to give over the hospital which he does lawfully possess and mr hutton was instituted and inducted into his benefice and

episcopus et carta sua confirmavit et inviolabiliter observari praecepit  by these constitutions it appears that the chapel first erected was dedicated to god mary magdalen and st nicholas and was served by three priests and four clerks part to officiate at the altar of mary magdalen and as the hospital was to receive both sexes other part to officiate at the altar of st nicholas where the women were to hear mass the chapel being situated at the south door of their house so that it seems the men and women had houses at separate sides of the area bishop kellaw for greater decorum built a new chapel on the north side of the great chapel which he dedicated to the blessed virgin and where he ordered mas to be celebrated daily to the brethren and to this service he appointed a fourth priest on dominical days and great solemnities he ordered service to be performed by all the priests to both men and women the men being preceded by their prior and the women by their prioress the procurator or master was not confined to be in clerical orders but was restrained to that moderation that he should not keep more than three horses without some urgent necessity the priests and clerks were to lie in the chamber next the chapel unless the master required one to lodge in his chamber and the master and all others were to dine and sup in the hall bishop kellaw appointed the times of service and the burning of lights before the altar the number of lepers to be entertained being sixtyfive the mess was directed each to have a loaf and a gallon of beer daily three days in the week flesh meat and four days fish so that one dish of meat fish cheese or butter should serve two but on great days two dishes were to be provided particularly on quadragesima day they were to have fresh salmon or other fish if they could be had for one dish and on michaelmasday they should have geese a goose to every four but if that festival happened on a weekly fast day the goose feast was to be postponed to sunday they were allowed yearly three yards of woollen cloth russett or white six yards of linen and six yards of canvas with other necessaries as trusses of straw and bundles of reeds with four yole clogs for the vigils of our savior the brethren were to choose their prior and the sisters their prioress they were allowed fires from michaelmasday to the day of all saints the measure of the peats fuel cut from the mosses of moor lands being fixed certain rules were ordained for the sick for funerals and prayers from pentecost to michaelmas red herrings and salted viands were prohibited two washers were appointed and an allowance for the nurses who attended the sick and each member was allowed in money at two days in the year fivepence and once in the year five shillings  it is presumed the hospital continued to be regulated and governed by the foregoing rules till the time of bishop langley when great abuses were complained of the pious institution being converted into private emolument and the buildings suffered to go to ruin that prelate issued his commission commission to enquire into dilapidations of sherburn hospital by thomas langley bishop of durham  th of september       dated the  th of september      directed to william chaunceller his temporal chancellor and others to visit and examine the dilapidations in the hospital erections and to enquire of the abuses of the charity upon the commissioners reporting the miserable condition and poverty thereof the bishop thought proper to apply to pope eugene iv instead of the king for redress who readily granted a faculty or commission to the bishop to make new rules and ordinances for the better government thereof which he accordingly made on the   d day of july      and thereby appointed that the future master should be in clerical orders and that he should keep four chaplains four clerks or singing men and two boys chaunters and ordained certain rules for the celebration of divine service and for the conduct of the priests clerks and boys nova ordinatio sive reformatio hospitalis de shirburn per thomam langley episcopum ex commissione eugenii papae quarti    julii       he directed that a tablet should be hung over the high altar inscribed with the names of bishop pudsey bishop de marisco and himself as also with the name of martin de sancta cruce that mass might be said for them it thereby appears that the leprosy for the relief of those under which affliction this hospital was founded was at that time almost eradicated for he directs that in remembrance of the original foundation two lepers should be received into the hospital if they could be found but to be kept apart from the rest of the people admitted to the house to those thirteen poor people were to be added to be provided with meat and drink of tenpence value every week or tenpence of ready money at their own option and have yearly the sum of  s  d for fuel and clothes and to mess and lodge in the same house and daily to attend mass upon the death of a brother another poor man to be chosen by the master within fifteen days under the penalty of paying a mark to the fabric of the church at durham an old woman of good character was to be provided at the masters expense to attend the brethren wash their linen and do other offices the master to have the care of all the goods and buildings of the hospital and to take an oath for the due performance of all things stipulated by those ordinances  we hear of no further abuses of the charity till the time of bishop tunstall when anthony salvin then master in      presented a petition to that prelate praying that a commission of enquiry might issue with interrogatories ad perpetuam rei memoriam which commission was accordingly issued and depositions were taken thereon the   th of april      and duly returned  sigillvm hospitalis christi in sherebvrne seal  in the twentyseventh year of queen elizabeth      chap    an act was passed for

by ten shillings a quarter as others absent formerly have been wont to receive provided always that no brother shall make sale of his place on pain of present expulsion  lastly it is ordained by the said reverend father that all the stock of goods and chattels corn hay utensils and implements of the said hospital whatsoever shall be delivered by the former master if he be living or by his executors or assigns if he be dead unto the successor and brethren by an inventory tripartite as was done lately after the death of master dr daile whereof one part to remain with the bishop of

of duresme for the time being in a bond of eight hundred pounds or more for the performance safety and delivery of all the said stock of goods and chattels corn hay utensils and implements whatsoever belonging to the said hospital at every change of the master according to the aforesaid inventory and the commendable examples of his predecessors the former masters of the said hospital  allowances

second time and expulsion for the third time as men undutiful and unworthy of her majestys bounty in that society etc  bishop crewe on his visitation in   0  made other rules and orders and afterward bishop chandler visited in august      and made new statutes which remaining unaltered at this time are presented to the reader  ordinances and rules for the good order and government of sherborn hospital in the county of durham ordinances and rules for the good order and government of the master and brethren of christs hospital at sherborne near durham and their possessions delivered to them the twentysixth day of august by edward by divine providence lord bishop of durham at his primary visitation of the said hospital which was begun august the   th      and continued by several adjournments to that day  edward by divine providence lord bishop of duresme to our well beloved in christ wadham chandler clerk master of arts master of the said hospital richard gray john whitfield and the rest of the brethren  if the changes incident to all persons and things did not insensibly introduce deviations from the original constitutions of societies also and make frequent reviews of the laws whereby they should be governed necessary for preserving a consistency between mens practices and their rules yet the present condition of christs hospital at sherburn in particular would demand a speedy provision to be made against some evils the house labors under and which by longer neglect may grow to be very detrimental to it  for having in our visitation upon the place discovered that all the local statutes made by our predecessors since the foundation of the said hospital by queen elizabeth with consent of her parliament were either lost concealed or of no validity for want of a ratification under the episcopal seal as is required by her act that their stocks of cattle and corn were destroyed and consumed in the time of the civil wars by the two armies in the neighborhood of sherburn house that no inventory has been since taken of their goods nor bond given by the entering master for any sum of money to be paid to every succeeding master as a fund in readiness for the occasions of the said hospital and as was wont formerly to be given we judged no time was to be lost in settling new rules without which no society can well subsist which may also be effectual for securing what goods and chattles are still remaining and prevent further ruin to their common estate which in a long chancery suit at this distance of time after a succession of two or three masters under a defect of full proofs must be hazarded with small prospect of success  in drawing up these rules we have revived as many ordinances of the first founders as could be adapted to the present state of things and followed those of our late predecessors where we could presume of their intentions by their articles of visitation which we have seen and these rules so collected and hereafter following we by the authority given us by act of parliament as well as the antienter constitutions of the first founders bishops of this diocese do for ourselves and successors order and appoint to be the standing rules to be observed by all the members of the said hospital until such time as any of our successors shall see cause or in their wisdom think proper to alter or amend them  and to prevent confusion by a disagreement of these with any former rules should any such come to light hereafter we after the example of our worthy predecessor thomas langley in his new ordination of the said hospital rescind and annul all former constitutions rules and ordinances made by any of our predecessors and do substitute these in their place as the only rules they shall be bound to obey given at our castle at durham the twentysixth day of august being one of the days and places to which we adjourned our visitation of the said hospital in the eighteenth year of our consecration fifth of our translation and in the year of our lord one thousand seven hundred and thirtyfive  concerning the master   the master shall be always a person in holy orders of the degree of master of arts at least a licensed preacher and one who is capable of business and applies himself to it especially for the maintenance and prosperous estate of the hospital    the master or his deputy appointed by him to act in his name shall usually reside within the said hospital for the better ordering and governing the members thereof according to an ancient constitution of tho langley bishop of duresme saving to the said bishop his ordinary jurisdiction over them    the master if he be not constantly resident in person shall often repair thither to preach and read lectures on catechetical heads to them and to enquire and hear the complaints of the brethren when they have any and see them redressed    the common seal shall be kept by the master only in a box locked up and not to be trusted with the deputy and the master shall be always present when the seal is put to any instrument    the counterparts of the leases shall be preserved in the custody of the master himself and as often as there shall be occasion to trust any writing out of his hands he shall take a note for the safe delivery of it    no demise of lands anciently used to be demised shall pass otherwise than by the common seal and no demise of lands not demiseable by queen elizabeths foundation shall be accounted valid in law though it be duly sealed with the common seal    upon sealing of any lease twelvepence and no more shall be given to every member that attends to sign the lease    the demesnes at sherburn shall never be demised by lease for years or lives but the whole or at least the greatest part thereof shall continue in the occupation of the master or his deputy steward or agent so that there shall always be maintained on the ground a full stock of young cattle of all kinds and a sufficient quantity of hay and stores of corn and other grain in the granaries to answer all occasions of the house    upon the death cession or resignation of every master so much of his stock and stores of all sorts as shall be prized to the value of two hundred pounds shall be delivered over to the succeeding master who shall be legally entitled thereto from the preceding master his heirs or executors or the sum of two hundred pounds for and in lieu and in full satisfaction for the same   0 for the better securing of this two hundred pounds or stock or stores to the value thereof every master soon after his induction shall be bound to the bishop of duresme in the penalty of four hundred pounds for the payment of two hundred pounds or stock and stores of that value to his lawful successor which bond shall be lodged in the registry of the bishops consistory court to be delivered up and cancelled upon performance of the condition by the preceding master     an exact inventory shall be taken by every master at his coming into his place of all the plate household goods kitchen and brewing vessels utensils in the dairy cellar and for husbandry linen bedding and all other furniture as well belonging to the house of the master as the houses of the brethren and three copies made thereof and signed by the said master the one to be lodged in the registry aforesaid with the bond for two hundred pounds the other to be preserved by the master himself and the third to be kept by the heirs or executors of the preceding master who is obliged to leave the same as he received them at his entrance according to the said inventory     the original of these statutes to be safely locked up in the same box with the common seal to be delivered with the said seal to the next lawful successor by the predecessor or his executors or administrators and a book shall be prepared for common use wherein these statutes and ordinances as far as they concern the brethren shall be fairly written with queen elizabeths act of foundation in the   th year of her reign and such other rules as shall hereafter be made by any succeeding bishop  these rules concerning the brethren are to be read to the innbrethren at a full meeting once a year     a quarto book shall be carefully kept by the master or his deputy wherein shall be fairly entered the names of all the present members and the time of their coming in and when and before whom they were sworn and as often as any of them die the brother who succeeds him shall have his name entered his country parish his age and the day of the year of his being sworn and by whom and whom he succeeds and till this be done no person shall be reckoned a brother or member of sherburnhouse     as many brethren shall be lodged within the house as the ancient lodgings will permit and have usually for many years past resided therein  of the brethren    in filling up the vacant places of the innbrethren a preference shall be often given to the outbrethren who in the masters opinion deserve to be taken into the house yet so as that it shall be a matter of choice and discretion in the master and not of obligaion to proceed in that way     these qualifications shall be required in every man that is admitted into sherburn house as a brother that he be a single person who has lived well and creditably in the world and is not at this time worth twenty pounds that he be born in the county of durham unless by special allowance of the bishop the county be dispensed with and particularly that such as have lived within the manors and been tenants to the lands of the bishopric or hospital estate if in other respects they be as well qualified shall have the preference that he be of the age of fiftysix or upwards never under that he be not then laboring under any sickness or incurable or infectious disease though the lame and impotent should be considered in the first place     he shall be a constant member of the church of england by law established and continue so     to this end we order that every man that desires to be a brother shall present a petition to the master setting forth his case with a certificate of his age under the hand of the minister of the parish where he was born and another certificate of his peaceable social disposition and sober behavior and conformity to the church of england for some years last past under the hands of credible gentlemen and others neighbors to the place where he has last lived which petitions and certificates shall be filed by the master to be produced when he shall be called upon     no one shall be treated as a brother and member of this corporation or entitled to any profits as such who has not first taken his corporal oath for performing such ordinances and rules as have been and shall hereafter be made and set down by the bishop of duresme under his hand and seal in writing for the good order and government of the master and brethren of the said hospital which said oath shall be taken before the bishop if he happens to be at that time in the city of durham or else before his spiritual chancellor or the chancellors principal surrogate without fee   0 within a month after every vacancy the master if he be in the country shall be bound to put in a new brother or within six weeks at most if the master be far absent and upon the masters neglecting to fill up the place within that time it shall be in the power of the bishop to name a brother without the master who shall be accordingly admitted     no woman child male relation or friend shall be suffered to abide with him in the room or lodging of any brother on any account except a nurse to take care of the sick     no brother shall presume to be absent from prayers to go abroad much less to lie out of the house without leave of the master or his deputy which shall be sparingly allowed and the time of absence not above two or three days and the leave to be noted in a book kept for that purpose     the brethren shall attend duly morning and evening prayer sermons on the lords day and the holy sacrament of the lords supper as often as it shall be administered and they shall be there early at the beginning of the respective offices and continue there to the end and the better to know who performs this duty the clerk of the chapel shall keep a weekly roll with the names of the brethren and prick at the name of every one present and on monday morning deliver this roll to the master or his deputy in order to their receiving admonition or correction according to the heinousness of their offense     the chaplain of the said hospital shall be constant in reading the morning and evening service according to the liturgy of the church of england and preach every lords day and mostly upon catechetical heads and administer the holy sacrament four times in the year at least of which the solemn festivals of christmas easter and whitsuntide shall be three of the times he shall be diligent in visiting the sick and exhorting the well as often as he knows of their doing amiss     for the employment of their thoughts on the week days a bible and whole duty of man shall be provided for every innbrother which upon the death of any of them shall go with all the furniture of his chamber bought by the master to his successor and they shall be often put in mind of daily prayers in secret in their own rooms     no brother shall be allowed to be a drunkard a fornicator or unchaste a caballer or mischiefmaker profane a despiser of god religion or divine worship injurious or unsociable to his fellows disrespectful saucy or disobdient to the master or in a word be guilty of any notorious crime or live a disorderly offensive life     in all these cases the master to whom the power and authority of governing the brethren and servants of the house is committed shall by himself or his deputy or the chaplain correct and punish the offender according to the quality and degree of the offense that is to say at first by a serious admonition and warning and then by suspending him from his diet for two three or more days according to the masters pleasure provided that the suspension be never longer than three weeks at a time and the value of the diet of the suspended person be divided among such of the brethren as are not offenders and if after the exercise of such discipline any brother shall go on to offend in the same way the master shall then carry his complaint of him to the bishop that he may be removed or otherwise punished as the bishop shall think fit     we ordain that the said brethren who are well and sound do eat together at dinner in their common hall or room according to a constitution of thomas langley to that effect unless for reasons to be given to the bishop he shall dispense with this rule for any time one of the brethren shall be chosen by themselves to say grace before and after meat or give god thanks for the bountiful provision he has made for them and for raising up such benefactors to them     the woman that is to wash their clothes etc shall be of middle age of good fame and conversation as the same also is required of all the other servants and ministers belonging to the house   0 we do revive and enforce the late orders concerning the manner of diet of the brethren throughout the year with some few alterations as annexed in a separate paper which we order to be transcribed and hung up in the hall where the brethren eat     lastly as to the relief of poor travelers at the gate which has been customary and no doubt piously intended we give no injunctions idle vagrants should be discouraged and punished necessitous travelers on their honest occasions supplied but care should be taken that such as have no legal settlement be not made burdensome to the hospital by an indiscreet relief as is directed by an act of parliament for ascertaining of settlements
