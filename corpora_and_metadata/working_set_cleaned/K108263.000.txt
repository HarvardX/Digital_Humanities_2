the year       but it is not enough that the laws of england exclude slavery merely from this island whilst the grand enemy of mankind triumphs in a toleration throughout our colonies of the most monstrous oppression to which human nature can be subjected  and yet this abominable wickedness has not wanted advocates who in a variety of late publications have attempted to palliate the guilt and have even ventured to appeal to scripture for the support of their uncharitable pretensions so that i am laid under a double obligation to answer them because it is not the cause of liberty alone for which i now contend but for that which i have still much more at heart the honor of the holy scriptures the principles of which are entirely opposite to the selfish and uncharitable pretensions of our american slaveholders and african traders  a late anonymous writer who calls himself an african merchant remarks that  by the law of moses the israelites might purchase slaves from the heathens and even their own people might become slaves to their brethren a treatise on the trade from great britain to africa etc by an african merchant p   and    now with respect to the first part of his observation it is true indeed that the israelites were expressly permitted to keep bondservants or slaves of the heathen or more properly of the nations  that were round about them and of the children of the strangers that sojourned among them levit xxv    to    but we must remember that these heathen or nations that were round about them were an abandoned race of people already slaves and worshippers of devils and by them led to debase human nature and to pollute themselves with the most unnatural and abominable vices for in all these said the almighty the nations are defiled which i cast out before you and the land is defiled therefore i do visit the iniquity thereof upon it and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants etc again for all these abominations have the men of the land done which were before you and the land is defiled etc see levit xviii and the children of the strangers abovementioned were probably also of the same detestable nations of palestine the amorites canaanites etc which were expressly doomed to destruction   observe thou that which i command thee this day behold i drive out before thee the amorite and the canaanite and the hittite and the perizzite and the hivite and the jebusite take heed to thyself lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou go lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee etc exodus xxxiv    and     and that by the hand of the israelites who were commanded to show them no pity   and thou shall consume all the people which the lord thy god shall deliver thee thine eye shall have no pity upon them etc deuteronomy vii    the lord thy god will put out those nations by little and little etc the lord thy god shall deliver them unto thee and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction until they be destroyed and he shall deliver their kings into thine hand and thou shall destroy their name from under heaven there shall no man be able to stand before thee until thou have destroyed them deuteronomy vii    and      but no doctrine must be drawn from these commands to execute gods vengeance upon the said wicked strangers without considering at the same time that very contrary treatment of strangers which was equally enjoined in the law for the israelites were positively commanded not to vex or oppress a stranger thou shall love him as thyself said moses by the express command of god if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land ye shall not vex or oppress him but the stranger that dwells with you shall be unto you as one born among you and thou shall love him as thyself for ye were strangers in the land of egypt levit xix      and again the lord your god is god of gods and lord of lords a great god a mighty and a terrible which regards not persons nor takes reward he does execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow and loves the stranger in giving him food and raiment love ye therefore the stranger for ye were strangers in the land of egypt deuteronomy x    to    in all these passages and many others the israelites were reminded of their bondage in egypt for so the almighty deliverer from slavery warned his people to limit and moderate the bondage which the law permitted by the remembrance of their own former bondage in a foreign land and by a remembrance also of his great mercy in delivering them from that bondage and he expressly referred them to their own feelings as they themselves had experienced the intolerable yoke of egyptian tyranny thou shall not oppress a stranger for ye know the heart of a stranger seeing ye were strangers in the land of egypt exodus xxiii   and again thou shall remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of egypt and the lord thy god redeemed thee deuteronomy xv     we must therefore necessarily conclude when these very opposite commands are considered that the heathen or nations that were round about or in the environs of the promised land and also the children of the strangers that dwelt among them mentioned at the same time whom the israelites were permitted to retain in perpetual bondage were not intended to be included and ranked under that general denomination of strangers to whom so much real affection benevolence and consideration are strictly commanded in the texts to which i have just now referred and consequently it must be allowed that the particular nations the seven nations of palestine see deuteronomy vii   which were expressly devoted to destruction were the only strangers whom the jews were permitted to hold in absolute slavery so that the wicked practice of enslaving the poor african negroes would have been as unlawful under the jewish dispensation as it certainly is now adays to englishmen and other subjects of great britain that profess the christian religion in whose consideration all strangers from every other part of the world are without doubt entitled to be ranked esteemed and beloved as brethren which i have elsewhere particularly demonstrated and which even the law of moses expressly commanded  but the stranger that dwells with you shall be unto you as one born among you and thou shall love him as thyself for ye were strangers in the land of egypt i am the lord your god levit xix    and     this excellent system of benevolence to strangers which the israelites were so strictly enjoined to observe cannot i apprehend be otherwise reconciled with the permission to the israelites of retaining in perpetual bondage the heathen that were round about them and the children of the strangers that sojourned among them for if this permission were to be extended to strangers in general it would subvert the express command concerning brotherly love due to strangers because a man cannot be said to love the stranger as himself if he holds the stranger and his progeny in a perpetual involuntary servitude the observation therefore of the african merchant that the israelites might purchase slaves from the heathens will by no means justify the enslaving of modern heathens by englishmen or by any other nation now subsisting the israelites at that time might not only purchase slaves of those particular heathen nations but they might also drive out these heathen i mean these which were particularly named nay even kill   but of the cities of these people which the lord thy god does give thee for an inheritance thou shall save alive nothing that breaths deuteronomy xx    and extirpate them and take possession of their cities houses and lands all these acts of violence might the israelites do without sin though the like would justly be esteemed murder and robbery if practiced by any other nation not under the like peculiar circumstances so that the example of the israelites affords no excuse for the uncharitable practices of the african merchant and west india planter the israelites had an express commission   now therefore kill every male among the little ones and kill every woman that has known man by lying with him numbers xxxi    this was the judgment against the midianitish prisoners the seven nations of palestine were likewise subjected to the same condemnation thou shall smite them and utterly destroy them thou shall make no covenant with them nor show mercy unto them deuteronomy vii   and a reason for this condemnation was plainly delivered in the fourth verse to confirm the justice of it for they will turn away thy son from following me that they may serve other gods  the amalekites were also doomed to destruction in the like manner thou shall blot out the remembrance of amalek from under heaven thou shall not forget it deuteronomy xxv      to execute gods vengeance without remorse   and thou shall consume all the people which the lord thy god shall deliver thee thine eye shall have no pity upon them deuteronomy vii     upon several populous nations which had rendered themselves abominable in the sight of god and therefore deserved no consideration so that even mercy in the israelites was a sin   but if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you then it shall come to pass that those which ye let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes and thorns in your sides and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell moreover it shall come to pass that i shall do unto you as i thought to do unto them numb xxxiii    and    and the israelites were expressly told that it was not on their own account that this extraordinary authority was put into their hands but on account of the abominable wickedness of those who possessed the promised land  the land is defiled therefore i do visit the iniquity thereof upon it and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants levit xviii     for all these abominations unnatural lusts mentioned in the former part of the same chapter have the men of the land done which were before you and the land is defiled levit xviii    and the israelites were warned against presumption lest such extraordinary authority should occasion spiritual pride not for thy righteousness or for the uprightness of thine heart do thou go to possess the land but for the wickedness of those nations the lord god does drive them out from before thee etc deuteronomy ix      when it interfered with this positive command of god  the commission there given however was but temporary and no other nation except gods peculiar people was charged with the execution of it and therefore though the europeans have taken upon themselves for a long time past to attack destroy drive out dispossess and enslave the poor ignorant heathen in many distant parts of the world and may perhaps plead custom and prescription to their shame be it said for their actions yet as they cannot like the israelites produce an authentic written commandment from god for such proceedings the offenders can no otherwise be esteemed than as lawless robbers and oppressors who have reason to expect a severe retribution from god for their tyranny and oppression it is unreasonable therefore to suppose that the severe treatment of the ancient heathen by the israelites under the dispensation of the law either in killing dispossessing or enslaving them should justify our modern acts of violence and oppression now that we profess obedience to the gospel of peace  and with respect to the second part of the african merchants observation concerning the israelites  viz that even their own people might become slaves to their brethren i must remark that he does not deal fairly by the jewish law to quote that circumstance without mentioning at the same time the just limitation to which it was subject and the admirable provision in the same law against the involuntary servitude of brethren because no hebrew could be made a slave without his own consent and even desire which was to be plainly and openly declared in a court of record  if the servant shall plainly say i love my master my wife and my children i will not go out free then says the text his master shall bring him unto the judges etc whereby an acknowledgement in a court of record is plainly implied and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul and he shall serve him for ever exodus xxi    but without that public acknowledgement of voluntary consent before the judges the hebrew master had no authority to bore the servants ear   yet our inconsiderate westindian and american planters make no scruple even of branding their poor negroservants with a hot iron to mark them for perpetual bondmen against their will though they are certainly their brethren in the eyes of god but god has declared expressly concerning the crimes of these men who enslave the poor  surely i will never forget any of their works shall not the land tremble for this etc etc etc amos viii    see also the whole context from the  th verse in token of bondage and in every other case it was absolutely unlawful for the israelite to hold a brother israelite in slavery the law expressly declares if thy brother that dwells by thee be waxen poor and be sold unto thee thou shall not compel him to serve as a bond servant but as an hired servant and as a sojourner he shall be with thee and shall serve thee unto the year of jubilee and then shall he depart from thee both he and his children with him etc and the reason of this command immediately follows for they are my servants said the lord which i brought forth out of the land of egypt i e which god himself delivered from slavery they shall not be sold as bondmen thou shall not rule over him with rigor but shall fear thy god levit xxv    to    and again in the   th verse for unto me said the lord the children of israel are servants they are my servants whom i brought out of the land of egypt i am the lord your god  thus it appears that the involuntary servitude of brethren is entirely inconsistent with the jewish law which therefore is so far from justifying the african merchant that it absolutely condemns him but he is still more mistaken when he insinuates that slavery is not inconsistent with the gospel jesus christ the savior of mankind and founder of our religion says he left the moral laws and civil rights of mankind upon their old foundations his kingdom was not of this world nor did he interfere with national laws he did not repeal that of slaves nor assert an universal freedom except from sin with him bond and free were accepted if they behaved righteously etc p    but how can a man be said to behave righteously who sells his brethren or holds them in slavery against their will for though with christ bond and free are accepted yet it behooves the african merchant very diligently to examine whether he is not likely to forfeit his own acceptance if he does not most heartily repent of having enslaved his brethren and of having encouraged others to the same uncharitable practices by misinterpreting the holy scriptures  under the gospel dispensation all mankind are to be esteemed our brethren christ commanded his disciples to go and teach or make disciples of all nations  matthew xxviii    so that men of all nations who indeed were brethren before by natural descent from one common father are now undoubtedly capable of being doubly related to us by a farther tie of of brotherhood which the law of moses seemed to deny them and of which the peculiar people of god jealous of their own adoption once thought them incapable i mean the inestimable privilege of becoming sons also to one almighty father by adoption as well as the jews and consequently of being our brethren through christ by a spiritual as well as a natural relationship  the promises of god likewise in every other part of the new testament are made to all mankind in general without exception so that a negro as well as any other man is capable of becoming an adopted son of god an heir of god through christ  0  that we might receive the adoption of sons said the apostle to the galatians and because ye are sons god has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying abba father wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of god through christ galat iv    and    a temple of the holy ghost    know ye not that ye are the temple of god and that the spirit of god dwells in you if any man defile the temple of god him shall god destroy for the temple of god is holy which temple ye are   corinthians iii      see also chap vi    0  an heir    that the gentiles should be fellowheirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in christ by the gospel ephesians iii   of salvation a partaker of the divine nature     through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature etc   pet i   and    a jointheir with christ    if children then heirs heirs of god and jointheirs with christ etc romans viii     and capable also of being joined to that glorious company of saints who shall one day come with him to judge the world for the saints shall judge the world   cor vi     and therefore how can any man who calls himself a christian presume to retain as a mere chattel or private property his fellow man and brother who is equally capable with himself of attaining the high dignities abovementioned let slaveholders be mindful of the approaching consummation of all earthly things when perhaps they will see thousands of those men who were formerly esteemed mere chattels and private property coming     at the coming of our lord jesus christ with all his saints   thessalonians iii      and enoch also the seventh from adam prophesied of these saying behold the lord comes with ten thousands of his saints to execute judgment upon all and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds etc jude xiv      in the clouds     and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory matt xxiv  0  behold he comes with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him rev i   and those men also who have worn out their brethren in slavery may surely be ranked with the wretches that pierced their lord  in as much as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren said our lord ye have done it unto me matt xxv  0 see the conclusion of my tract on the law of liberty    with their heavenly master to judge tyrants and oppressors and to call them to account for their want of brotherly love  the ethiopians or negroes received the christian faith much sooner than the europeans themselves their early conversion was foretold by the psalmist psalm lxviii    princes shall come out of egypt or from mizraim and ethiopia    wherever we find mention made in the old testament of ethiopians though a general name for negroes yet we shall find them expressed in the hebrew by the name of the eldest branch of ham viz chus  however we must remember that all ethiopians are not cushites the prodigious army of a million of ethiopians which was overthrown by asa were not all descendants of chus though mentioned under the general name of  chusim in   chronicles chap xiv for we read in the   th chap  th verse that part of that vast body were lubims were not the ethiopians and lubims  a huge host said the prophet hanani when he reminded asa of his former success the lubims or libyans were a great nation from whom the internal part of africa receives its name of libya and were descended from mizraim the second son of ham who was also the father of the egyptians or cush shall soon stretch out her hands unto god and accordingly we find the ethiopian eunuch    who might justly be esteemed a prince of that country being  a lord or one of great authority under candace queen of the ethiopians who had the charge of all her treasure etc particularly mentioned in scripture among the first converts to christianity and that extraordinary exertion of the holy spirit in favor of the eunuch was perhaps the foundation of the ancient church of habassinia    the learned lutholf was of a different opinion and supposed that the habassinians were not converted till the time of constantine the great about the year   0 and though it is not clear whether this latter period was the time of their first conversion or not yet certain it is that ever since that time they have maintained the christian faith and the sacramental institutions of christ without yielding to the adulterations of the church of rome though the same were pressed upon them with all the authority that one of their own emperors could exert lutholf has given a full and clear account printed in      of those christian negroes and their church which seems to be reserved by the providence of god as a witness of the purity of his holy religion a witness not less remarkable than the church of the vaudois  which notwithstanding all worldly disadvantages remains in some degree of purity to this day as a lasting monument of christianity among the sons of ham even in the most remote and inaccessible part of africa  0 they still retain water baptism and the holy communion in both kinds and drove out the portuguese jesuits for attempting by force to pervert and corrupt these primitive rites certain it is say the learned assembly of divines that ethiopia according to this unquestionable prophecy psalms lxviii    was one of the first kingdoms that was converted to the christian faith the occasion and means whereof we read of acts viii       etc  the progress of the truth must have been very rapid in africa because we read of a council of african and numidian bishops held at carthage so early as the year of christ        carthaginense   circa annum ccxv sub agrippino episcopo carthaginensi ab africae et numidiae episcopis de rebaptizandis haereticis habitum dr caves hist literaria p     though our anglosaxon ancestors remained in the grossest pagan darkness near  00 years afterward and in the year   0 a council of    bishops was assembled at lambesa an inland city of africa on the confines of biledulgerid against privatus bishop of lambesa on a charge of heresy    dr caves hist literaria p    the fourth council of carthage in the year     was held by    bishops concerning the baptism of infants    ibid and in the eighth council at that place anno     besides    presents erant preter presbyteros diaconos maximamque plebis partem episcopi lxxxvii etc see dr caves hist literaria p  00 also bohuns geog dict p     under the word lambesa priests deacons and laymen there were present    bishops in another council of carthage about the year  0  no less than   0 bishops of the sect of the donatists    dr caves hist lit p     were present and in the year     at baga an inland city of africa   0    ibid p     bishops were collected together though the same was long before the conversion of the english and dutch the great traders in african slaves and though the africans have since lamentably fallen back into gross ignorance yet we must not on that account look upon them in the same light that the jews did upon the children of the strangers whom they were permitted to hold in slavery levit xxv    because we cannot do so without becoming strangers ourselves to christianity and hastening our own apostasy which seems already too near at hand    the alarming increase of infidelity and the open declarations of deists arians socinians and others who deny the divinity of christ and of the holy ghost are lamentable proofs of the growing apostasy the african church fell away by degrees in the same manner till it was totally lost in the most barbarous ignorance except in habessinia for even those africans who are free from idolatry and profess to worship the true god are nevertheless ensnared and enslaved in the gross errors of mahometanism to which a neglect of the necessary faith in the divinity of christ and of the holy ghost has an apparent tendency we have likewise a remarkable instance of infidelity or at least of a total neglect of scripture authority and revelation in the attempt of two late writers to prove that negroes are an inferior species of men but the learned dr beattie in his essay on truth has fully refuted the insinuations of mr hume the first broacher of that uncharitable doctrine as well as aristotles futile attempt to justify slavery so that mr estwicks subsequent attempt which was prompted only by the authority of mr hume needs no further confutation that i may not be thought a blind admirer of antiquity says dr beattie i would here crave the readers indulgence for one short digression more in order to put him in mind of an important error in morals inferred from partial and inaccurate experience by no less a person than aristotle himself he argues that men of little genius and great bodily strength are by nature destined to serve and those of better capacity to command and that the natives of greece and of some other countries being naturally superior in genius have a natural right to empire and that the rest of mankind being naturally stupid are destined to labor and slavery de republ lib   cap     this reasoning is now alas of little advantage to aristotles countrymen who have for many ages been doomed to that slavery which in his judgment nature had destined them to impose on others and many nations whom he would have consigned to everlasting stupidity have shown themselves equal in genius to the most exalted of human kind it would have been more worthy of aristotle to have inferred mans natural and universal right to liberty from that natural and universal passion with which men desire it he wanted perhaps to devise some excuse for servitude a practice which to their eternal reproach both greeks and romans tolerated even in the days of their glory  mr hume argues nearly in the same manner in regard to the superiority of white men over black i am apt to suspect says he the negroes and in general all the other species of men for there are four or five different kinds to be naturally inferior to the whites there never was a civilized nation of any other complexion than white nor even any individual eminent either in action or speculation no ingenious manufactures among them no arts no sciences  there are negro slaves dispersed all over europe of which none ever discovered any symptoms of ingenuity humes essay on national characters  these assertions are strong but i know not whether they have any thing else to recommend them for first though true they would not prove the point in question except it were also proved that the africans and americans even though arts and sciences were introduced among them would still remain unsusceptible of cultivation the inhabitants of great britain and france were as savage two thousand years ago as those of africa and america are at this day to civilize a nation is a work which it requires long time to accomplish and one may as well say of an infant that he can never become a man as of a nation now barbarous that it never can be civilized secondly of the facts here asserted no man could have sufficient evidence except from a personal acquaintance with all the negroes that now are or ever were on the face of the earth those people write no histories and all the reports of all the travelers that ever visited them will not amount to any thing like a proof of what is here affirmed but thirdly we know that these assertions are not true the empires of peru and mexico could not have been governed nor the metropolis of the latter built after so singular a manner in the middle of a lake without men eminent both for action and speculation every body has heard of the magnificence good government and ingenuity of the ancient peruvians the africans and americans are known to have many ingenious manufactures and arts among them which even europeans would find it no easy matter to imitate sciences indeed they have none because they have no letters but in oratory some of them particularly the indians of the five nations are said to be greatly our superiors it will be readily allowed that the condition of a slave is not favorable to genius of any kind and yet the negro slaves dispersed over europe have often discovered symptoms of ingenuity notwithstanding their unhappy circumstances they become excellent handicraftsmen and practical musicians and indeed learn every thing their masters are at pains to teach them perfidy and debauchery not excepted that a negro slave who can neither read nor write nor speak any european language who is not permitted to do any thing but what his master commands and who has not a single friend on earth but is universally considered and treated as if he were of a species inferior to the human  that such a creature should so distinstuish himself among europeans as to be talked of through the world for a man of genius is surely no reasonable expectation to suppose him of an inferior species because he does not thus distinguish himself is just as rational as to suppose any private european of an inferior species because he has not raised himself to the condition of royalty  had the europeans been destitute of the arts of writing and working in iron they might have remained to this day as barbarous as the natives of africa and america nor is the invention of these arts to be ascribed to our superior capacity the genius of the inventor is not always to be estimated according to the importance of the invention gunpowder and the mariners compass have produced wonderful revolutions in human affairs and yet were accidental discoveries such probably were the first essays in writing and working in iron suppose them the effects of contrivance they were at least contrived by a few individuals and if they required a superiority of understanding or of species in the inventors those inventors and their descendents are the only persons who can lay claim to the honor of that superiority  that every practice and sentiment is barbarous which is not according to the usages of modern europe seems to be a fundamental maxim with many of our critics and philosophers their remarks often put us in mind of the fable of the man and the lion if negroes and indians were disposed to recriminate if a lucian or a voltaire from the coast of guinea or from the five nations were to pay us a visit what a picture of european manners might he present to his countrymen at his return nor would caricatura or exaggeration be necessary to render it hideous a plain historical account of some of our most fashionable duellists gamblers and adulterers to name no more would exhibit specimens of brutish barbarity and sottish infatuation such as might vie with any that ever appeared in kamschatka california or the land of hottentots  it is easy to see with what views some modern authors throw out these hints to prove the natural inferiority of negroes but let every friend to humanity pray that they may be disappointed britons are famous for generosity a virtue in which it is easy for them to excel both the romans and the greeks let it never be said that slavery is countenanced by the bravest and most generous people on earth by a people who are animated with that heroic passion the love of liberty beyond all nations ancient or modern and the fame of whose toilsome but unwearied perseverance in vindicating at the expense of life and fortune the sacred rights of mankind will strike terror into the hearts of sycophants and tyrants and excite the admiration and gratitude of all good men to the latest posterity essay on truth p           0             and       we may lament the fallen state of our unhappy brethren but we have no commission under the gospel to punish them for it as the israelites had to punish the heathens that were condemned in the law our endeavor should be rather to restore the heathens to their lost privileges than to harden them in their prejudices by tolerating amongst us a greater degree of despotism and oppression than was ever permitted among the jews or even among the ancient heathens for in one of our own antichristian colonies even the murder of a negro slave when under private punishment is tolerated see the    th act of barbados and by the same diabolical act of assembly a man may of wantonness or of bloody mindedness or cruel intention it is expressly said  wilfully kill a negro or other slave of his own without any other penalty for it than a trifling fine of l   sterling see remarks on this act in my tract against slavery in england    a representation of the injustice and dangerous tendency of tolerating slavery in england london      p    and    many instances of west india cruelty have fallen even within my own knowledge and i have certain proofs of no less than three married women being violently torn away from their lawful husbands    nothing can be more presumptuously contrary to the laws of god than these unnatural outrages have ye not read said christ himself that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wise and they twain shall be one flesh wherefore they are no more twain but one flesh what therefore god has joined together let no man put asunder matthew xix     and   even in london by the order of their pretended proprietors another remarkable instance of tyranny which came within my own knowledge was the advertizing a reward in the gazetteer of the  st june      for apprehending an east india black boy about    years of age named bob or pompey he was further distinguished in the advertizement by having round his neck a brass collar with a direction upon it to a house in charlottestreet bloomsburysquare thus the black indian pompey was manifestly treated with as little ceremony as a black namesake of the dog kind could be i inquired after the author of this unlawful and shameful advertizement and found that he was a merchant even in the heart of the city of london who shall be nameless for i do not want to expose individuals but only their crimes now if masters are capable of such monstrous oppression even here in england where their brutality renders them liable to severe penalties how can we reasonably reject the accounts of tyranny in america howsoever horrid and inhuman where the abominable plantation laws will permit a capricious or passionate master with impunity to deprive his wretched slave even of life  i am frequently told nevertheless by interested persons from the west indies how well the slaves are used and that they are much happier than our own poor at home but though i am willing to believe that some sew worthy westindians treat their slaves with humanity yet it is certainly far from being the general case and the misery of our own poor will not be any excuse for the oppression of the poor elsewhere when any of our own countrymen at home are miserably poor it is not always clear whether themselves or others are to be blamed all we can know for certain is that it is the indispensable duty of every man to relieve them according to his ability and that the neglecting an opportunity of doing so is as great an offense before god as if we had denied assistance to christ himself in the same wretched condition sor so it is expressly laid down in scripture  0 then shall the king say unto them on his right hand  come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for i was an hungered and ye gave me meat i was thirsty and ye gave me drink i was a stranger and ye took me in naked and ye clothed me i was sick and ye visited me i was in prison and ye came unto me then shall the righteous answer him saying lord when saw we thee an hungered and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink when saw we thee a stranger and took thee in or naked and clothed thee or when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto thee and the king shall answer and say unto them verily i say unto you inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me then shall he say also unto them on the left hand depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels for i was an hungered and ye gave me no meat i was thirsty and ye gave me no drink i was a stranger and ye took me not in naked and ye clothed me not sick and in prison and ye visited me not then shall they also answer him saying lord when saw we thee an hungered or a thirst or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister unto thee then shall he answer them saying verily i say unto you inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these ye did it not to me and these shall go away into ever lasting punishment but the righteous into life eternal matthew xxv        through the mercy of god toward the poor but it is obvious to whom the misery of a slave is to be attributed for the guilty possessor will certainly be answerable to god for it and every man who endeavors to palliate and screen such oppression is undoubtedly a partaker of the guilt the slaveholder deceives himself if he thinks he can really be a christian and yet hold such property can he be said to love his neighbor as himself    i have examined this point more at large in a tract on the law of liberty which is intended also for publication does he behave to others as he would they should to him ye have heard that it has been said thou shall love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but i say unto you said our lord himself love your enemies etc that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he makes his sun to rise on the evil and on the good and sends rain on the just and on the unjust matthew v       so that heathens are by no means excluded from the benevolence of christians  thus christ has enlarged the ancient jewish doctrine of loving our neighbors as ourselves and has also taught us by the parable of the good samaritan that all mankind even our professed enemies such as were the samaritans to the jews must necessarily be esteemed our neighbors whenever they stand in need of our charitable assistance so that the same benevolence which was due from the jew to his brethren of the house of israel is indispensably due under the gospel to our brethren of the universe howsoever opposite in religious or political opinions for this is the apparent intention of the parable  no nation therefore whatever can now be lawfully excluded as strangers according to that uncharitable sense of the word stranger in which the jews were apt to distinguish all other nations from themselves and since all men are now to be esteemed brethren and neighbors under the gospel none of the levitical laws relating to the bondage of strangers are in the least applicable to justify slavery among christians though the same laws bind christians as well as jews with respect to all the lessons of benevolence to strangers which are every where interspersed therein because these are moral doctrines which never change for they perfectly correspond with the everlasting gospel rev xiv   as for instance thou shall not oppress a stranger for ye know the heart of a stranger seeing ye were strangers in the land of egypt exodus xxiii   this is an appeal to the feelings and experience of the jews who had themselves endured a heavy bondage so that it clearly corresponds with the royal law or law of liberty in the gospel thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself gal v    or as our lord himself has more fully expressed it all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them for this is the law and the prophets matthew vii     again if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land ye shall not vex or oppress him but the stranger that dwells with you shall be unto you as one born among you and thou shall love him viz the stranger as thyself for ye were strangers in the land of egypt i am the lord your god levit xix    let every slaveholder consider the importance of this command and the unchangeable dignity of him who gave it i am the lord your god  for the lord your god is god of gods and lord of lords a great god a mighty and a terrible which regards not persons not the masters more than any slaves nor takes reward he does execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow and loves the stranger in giving him food and raiment love ye therefore the stranger for ye were strangers in the land of egypt deuteronomy x          and how can a man be said to love the stranger and much less to love him as himself see the express command above who presumes to vex and oppress him with a perpetual involuntary bondage is this obedience to that great rule of the gospel which christ has given us as the sum of the law and the prophets would the american slaveholders relish that contemptuous and cruel usage with which they oppress their poor negroes and that the african    the prosent deplorable slate of the african strangers in general ought to warn us of similar jugments against the inhabitants of thse kingdoms my own grandfather near a century ago wanting only three years viz in    warned our great national counsel of gods vengeance by this very example  that africa says h which is not now more fruitful of monsters than it was once of excellently wise and learned men that africa which formerly afforded us our clemens our origin our tertuian our cyprian our augustine and many other extraordinary lights in the church of god that famous africa in whose soil christianity did thrive so prodigiously and could boast of so many jourishing churches alas is now a wilderness the wild boars have broken into the vineyard and eaten it up and it brings forth nothing but briars and thorns to use the words of the prophet and who knows but god may suddenly make this church and nation this our england which jeshurun like is waxed fat and grown proud and has kicked against god such another example of the vengeance of this kind  see arch bp sharps sermons second vol  st sermon which was preached before the house of commons april         page      strangers should do even so to themselves without the least personal provocation or fault on their part viz to be branded with a hot iron in order to be known and ranked as the cattle and private property of their oppressors like the cattle also to be ignominously compelled by the whip of a driver to labor hard without wages or recompense if the african merchants and american slaveholders can demonstrate that they would not think themselves injured by such treatment from others they may perhaps be free from the horrid guilt of unchristian oppression and uncharitableness which must otherwise inevitably be imputed to them because their actions will not bear the test of that excellent rule of the gospel abovementioned which christ has laid down as the measure of our actions  all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them for this is the law and the prophets math vii    i must therefore once more repeat what i have before advanced that the permission formerly granted to the jews of holding heathens and strangers in slavery is virtually repealed or rather superseded by the gospel notwithstanding the contrary assertion of the african merchant that christ did not repeal that of slaves  the african merchant has also republished the letters of his fellow advocate mercator who professes in the same manner to draw his authority from sacred history  to the sedate to the reasonable to the christian readers says he i shall more fully set forth the lawfulness of the slave trade from the express allowance of it in holy writ ibid appendix b iv but the very first insinuation concerning the origin of slavey which follows this specious address to the sedate etc is founded on two false assertions even in one sentence and therefore i cannot esteem him worthy of any further notice than that of pointing out these proofs of his little regard to truth as to its origin says he it may possibly be derived from that sentence expressed against canaan  from whom the africans says he are descended by his father noah at the hour of his death    it was not at the honr of his death but when he awoke from his wine after he had tasted too freely the fruits of the vineyard which he planted when he began to be a husbandman the time therefore was probably very soon after the flood and not at the hour of his death as misrepresented by mercator for he lived after the flood   0 years genests ix    cursed be canaan a servant of servants shall he be to his brethren but though the author afterward allows that both the origin of slavery and the color of the africans are incapable of positive proof yet the futility of his insinuation concerning the descent of the africans is not like the other two circumstances incapable of positive proof for the africans are not descended from canaan if we except the carthaginians a colony from the sea coast of the land of canaan who were a free people and at one time rivalled even the roman common wealth in power the africans are principally descended from the three other sons of ham viz cush misraim and phut and to prove this more at large i have subjoined to this tract a letter which i received in answer to mine on the same subject from a learned gentleman who has most carefully studied the antiquities of the line of ham the insinuation therefore concerning the sentence expressed against canaan can by no means justify the african slave trade so that mercator seems indeed to write like a mere trader for the sake of his iniquitous traffic more than for the sake of truth notwithstanding his professions of regard for the holy scriptures  if we carefully examine the scriptures we shall find that slavery and oppression were ever abominable in the sight of god for though the jews were permitted by the law of moses on account of the hardness of their hearts to keep slaves as i have remarked in my answer to the reverend mr thompson on this subject which is subjoined yet there was no inherent right of service to be implied from this permission because whenever the flave could escape he was esteemed free and it was absolutely unlawful for any man who believed the word of god to deliver him up again to his master see deuteronomy xxiii       whereas in our colonies which in acts of oppression may too justly be esteemed antichristian the slave who runs away is deemed rebellious and a reward of l  0 is offered to those who shall kill or bring in alive any rebellious slave see the   th act of the laws of jamaica by an act of virginia   ann chapter       p     after proclamation is issued against slaves that run away and lie out it is lawful for any person whatfoever to kill and destroy such slaves by such ways and means as he she or they shall think fit without accusation or impeachment of any crime for the same etc see the remarks on these and such other diabolical acts of plantation assemblies in pages    to    of my representation of the injustice and dangerous tendency of tolerating slavery in england printed in       by another act of virginia    geo   chap     p     if a poor fellow is taken up as a runaway and committed to prison the jailer may let him out to hire in order to pay the fees even though he is not claimed and his master or owner says the act cannot be known and in a following clause the jailer is ordered to cause a strong iron collar to be put on the neck of such negroe or runaway with the letters p g stamped thereon a most abominable affront to human nature our spiritual enemy must have had a notorious influence with the plantation law makers to procure an act so contradictory to the laws of god    even white servants english scotch and irish are frequently taken up by the sheriff and goalers without any warrant or previous judgment whatever merely on suspicion of being servants and they are then advertized to be delivered up to their tyrannical masters but though there is great injustice and oppression in taking up these poor people merely on suspicion of being servants yet it does not appear to be so flagrant a breach of gods command beforementioned as the delivering up the poor runaway negroes who are foreigners and strangers and consequently less capable of obtaining redress when they are really injured the white servants are generally understood to be bound to their masters only for a short limited time either with their own consent by private contract or as felons who are banished their mother country after a fair trial by jury which excludes any suspicion of injustice and are sold for a certain term to pay the expenses of their passage etc whereby the right of service claimed from them by the master is more in the nature of a pecuniary debt than of absolute slavery so that the white runaway servant may perhaps as a debtor be delivered up to his master without any direct breach of the law of god beforementioned provided there is no apprehension or probability of his being treated with cruelty on his return or that the master would be liable to exact more service than is due in which case the law ought to afford protection and redress but no pretenses of this kind can justify the delivering up a a negroe stranger the poor negroes are claimed for life as an absolute property though to compare their case with white servants they never offended any member of our community either at home or abroad to justify such a severe punishment under british government neither are they capable of entering into such a legal contract for service as might justify a masters claim to it being absolutely incapacitated by unlawful duress to enter into any contract as long as they are detained by force or fear in the british dominions for which injustice to strangers the british dominions must sooner or later receive a severe retribution and therefore the delivering up to his master a negroe servant that has escaped from his master and has since regained his natural liberty must necessarily be esteemed a shameful and notorious breach of gods law nevertheless our public prints inform us even of an english man of war and another vessel being lately sent from grenada to the spanish main to claim some slaves that had made their escape from the islands see gazetteer june  0      the writer of the paragraph also expresses great disappointment on account of the issue of this unwarrantable and disgraceful embassy instead of meeting with that justice and civility which sa he they had a right to expect the governors at both places we are told treated them with the greatest haughtiness and contempt and refused to give them the smallest satisfaction but alas the very expectation of better treatment upon an errand so unlawful in itself and so disgraceful to his majestys naval service is a proof of the most deplorable degeneracy and ignorance even the cruel spaniards are more civilized and show more mercy to their slaves at present than the english of which their new regulations for the abolishing of slavery afford ample proof though the retribution for their former tyranny has lately fallen heavily on them according to the last accounts from chiloe and chili which ought to be considered as merciful warnings to the rest of the world against tyranny and slavery and in particular to that last cited from deutrenomy viz thou shall not deliver unto his master the servant which is escaped from his master unto thee he shall dwell with thee among you in that place which he shall choose that is manifestly as a free man in one of thy gates where it likes him best thou shall not oppress him deuteronomy xxiii       this is clearly a moral law which must be ever binding as the will of god because the benevolent intention of it is apparent and must ever remain the same for which reason i conclude that an action of trover cannot lie for a slave and that no man can lawfully be prosecuted for protecting a negroe or any other slave whatever that has escaped from his master because that would be punishing a man for doing his indispensable duty according to the laws of god and if any law custom or precedent should be alleged to the contrary it must necessarily be rejected as null and void because it is a maxim of the common law of england that the inferior law must give place to the superior mans laws to gods laws attorney general noys maxims p    and the learned author of the doctor and student asserts that even statute law ought to be accounted null and void if it is set forth contrary to the laws of god etiam si aliquod statutum esse editum contra eos nullius vigoris in legibus angliae censeri debet etc  chap vi  the degree of servitude which the israelites were permitted to exact of their brethren was mild and equitable when compared with the servitude which to our confusion be it said is common among christians i have already quoted from leviticus a specimen of the limitation to the servitude of brethren but the jews were not only restrained from oppressing their brethren but were also bound by the law to assist them generously and bountifully according to every mans ability when they dismissed them from their service which is a duty too seldom practiced among christians see deutrenomy xv    if thy brother an hebrew man or an hebrew woman be sold unto thee and serve thee six years then in the seventh year thou shall let him go free from thee    see also exodus xxi   and when thou sendest him out free from thee thou shall not let him go away empty thou shall furnish him liberally out of thy flock and out of thy floor and out of thy wine press of that wherewith the lord thy god has blessed thee thou shall give unto him and thou shall remember that thou wast a bondsman in the land of egypt and the lord thy god redeemed thee therefore i command thee this thing to day these are the very utmost limits of servitude that we might venture to exact of our brethren even if we were jews and how much more are we bound to observe every thing that is merciful in the law whilst we profess christianity what then must we think of ourselves if we compare these jewish limitations with our plantation laws a bountiful recompense for the service is plainly enjoined whereas the whole substance perhaps of the most wealthy english or scotch slaveholders would not suffice to pay what is due in strict justice to those who have labored in his service if the reward is to be proportioned to their sufferings but it shall one day be required of them  your gold and silver is cankered and the rust of them shall be a witness against you and shall eat your flesh as it were fire ye have heaped treasure together for the last days behold the hire of the laborers which have reaped down your fields which is of you kept back by fraud cries and the cries of them which have reaped are eutered into the ears of the lord of sabbath  or of armies james v   and    the slaveholder perhaps will say that this text is not applicable to him since he cannot be said to have kept back by fraud the hire of his laborers because he never made any agreement with them for wages having bought their bodies of the slave dealer and thereby made them his own private property so that he has a right he will say to all their labor without wages but this is a vain excuse for his oppression because it is not so much the previous agreement as the labor which renders wages due for the labourer is worthy of his hire luke x   and the sin which cries in the ears of the lord of sabbath is the using a poor mans labor without wages so that whether there is an agreement for wages or no agreement yet if the labor is performed the wages are due and those who keep them back may be said to build their house in unrighteousness as the prophet jeremiah has declared in the strongest terms jer xxii    woe unto him that builds his house by unrighteousness and his chambers by wrong that uses his neighbors service without wages and gives him not for his work  and the holy job even before the law declared his detestation of unrewarded service if my land said he cry against me or that the furrows likewise thereof complain if i have eaten the fruits thereof without money or have caused the owners thereof to lose there life    which was too much the case in the late english acquisition of the fine cream part of the island of st vincents  see authentic papers relative to the expedition against the charibbs page    let thistles grow instead of wheat and cockle instead of barley job xxxi      0  the wise son of sirach has also added his testimony to the same doctrine he that defraudeth the labourer of his hire is a bloodsheder ecclesiasticus xxxiv    the slaveholder will perhaps endeavor to evade these texts also by alleging that though indeed he uses his neighbors service without wages yet he cannot be said to give him nothing for his work because he is at the expense of providing him with food and clothing    osnabrug trowsers and sometimes also a cap and therefore this severe text is not applicable to him but let such a one remember if he calls himself a christian that christian masters are absolutely bound to have some regard to the interest of their servants as well as to their own interest  masters give unto your servants that which is just and equal knowing that ye also have a master in heaven colloss iv    but slaveholders in general have no idea of what is just and equal to be given to servants according to the scriptures  it is not a mere support in food and necessaries as a master feeds his horse or his ass to enable the creature to perform his labor but as man is superior to brutes a further reward is just and equal to be given to the human servant i have already sufficiently proved that every man under the gospel is to be considered as our neighbor and brother and consequently whatever was just and equal to be given by a jew to his neighbor or hebrew brother under the old testament the same must necessarily be considered as just and equal and absolutely due from christians to men of all nations without distinction whom we are bound to treat as brethren under the gospel in whatever capacity they serve us let the american slaveholder therefore remember that even according to the jewish law if he argues upon it as a christian ought to do he is absolutely indebted to each of his slaves for every days labor beyond the first six years of his servitude in the seventh year said the lord by moses thou shall let him go free from thee and when thou sendest him out free from thee thou shall not let him go away empty thou shall furnish him liberally out of thy flock etc wherewith the lord thy god has blessed thee thou shall give unto him etc  if this was the indispensable duty even of jews how much more is it just and equal to be observed by christian the same command when applied to the american planter will include a proper stock of plants for cultivation as sugarcanes tobacco indigo etc as well as cattle and stores to enable a poor man to maintain himself and family upon a small farm or lot of spare ground let for a certain limited time on reasonable terms and renewable on equitable conditions which are the only true means of reducing the price of labor and provisions let not the planter grudge to part with his servant when he has served a reasonable time in proportion to his price agreeable for instance to the regulations adopted by the spaniards which i have already recommended to the english planters see appendix   for the word of god forbids any such base reluctance it shall not seem hard unto thee when thou sendest him away free from thee for he has been worth a double hired servant to thee in serving thee six years and the lord thy god shall bless thee in all that thou do deuteronomy xv     the slaveholder perhaps will allege that though the jews were bound to show this benevolence to their brethren of israel yet the same laws do not bind the american planter because his slaves are for the most part heathens or as some of the negroes are mahometans and therefore he is not bound to consider them as his brethren being rather justified by the law which permitted the jews to keep heathen slaves and the children of the strangers in perpetual bondage etc they shall be your bondmen for ever  see leviticus xxv       and     but i have already guarded against this objection in the former part of this tract and it must clearly appear by the several points since mentioned that as christians we must not presume to look upon any man whatever in the same light that the israelites once did upon the children of the strangers whether they be black or white heathens or mahometans  if a heathen or a mohammedan happens to fall into our hands shall we confirm his prejudices by oppression instead of endeavoring to instruct him as a brother surely the blood of such a poor infidel must rest on the guilty head of that nominal christian who neglects the opportunity of adding to the number of his brethren in the faith and therefore let that man who endeavors to deprive others of their just privileges as brethren take heed lest he should thereby unhappily occasion his own rejection in the end when that dreadful doom which the uncharitable must expect will certainly be pronounced  for then  the king the king of kings shall answer and say unto them  verily i say unto you  in as much as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren for that glorious king will esteem even the meanest slaves as his brethren if they believe in him ye have done it unto me depart from me ye cursd into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels matt xxv  0    i know you not xxv

religion by granville sharp  with an introductory preface by a gentleman of the law in west jersey containing the sentiments of the monthly reviewers on a tract by the rev t thompson in favor of the slave trade  the lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed  a refuge in time of trouble psalm ix   burlington west jersey printed mdcclxxiii  london reprinted       preface by the american editor the following essay though wrote as the author signifies in haste is thought to have such merit as to deserve a publication  the copy was sent to one of the writers particular friends whether for his own peculiar satisfaction or the press is uncertain but as the subject is liberty so it is expected the freedom which is here taken cannot justly give him offense or be unacceptable to the public  it was designed to confute a piece wrote by thomas thompson m a some time fellow of c c c entitled the african trade for negro slaves shown to be consistent with principles of humanity and with the laws of revealed religion printed at canterbury  in order to show that the essay writer has not misrepresented the text nor is single in his observations upon it the sentiments of the monthly reviewers on that pamphlet in may      are here inserted  we must acknowledge say they that the branch of trade here under consideration is a species of traffic which we have never been able to reconcile with the dictates of humanity and much less with those of religion the principal argument in its behalf seems to be the necessity of such a rescource in order to carry on the works in our plantations which we are told it is otherwise impossible to perform but this though the urgency of the case may be very great is not by any means sufficient to justify the practice there is a farther consideration which has a plausible appearance and may be thought to carry some weight it is that the merchant only purchases those who were slaves before and possibly may rather than otherwise render their lituation more tolerable but it is well known that the lot of our slaves when most favorably considered is very hard and miserable besides which such a trade is taking the advantage of the ignorance and brutality of unenlightened nations who are encouraged to war with each other for this very purpose and it is to be feared are sometimes tempted to seize those of their own tribes or families that they may obtain the hoped for advantage and it is owned with regard to our merchants that upon occasion they observe the like practices which are thought to be allowable because they are done by way of reprisal for theft or damage committed by the natives we were pleased however to meet with a pamphlet on the other side of the question and we entered upon its perusal with the hopes of finding somewhat advanced which might afford us satisfaction on this difficult point the writer appears to be a sensible man and capable of discussing the argument but the limits to which he is confined rendered his performance rather superficial the plea he produces from the jewish law is not in our view of the matter at all conclusive the people of israel were under a theocracy in which the supreme being was in a peculiar sense their king and might therefore issue forth some orders for them which it would not be warrantable for another people who were in different circumstances to observe such for instance was the command given concerning the extirpation of the canaanites whom the sovereign arbiter of life and death might if he had pleased have destroyed by plague or famine or other of those means which we term natural causes and by which a wise providence fulfils its own purposes but it would be unreasonable to infer from the manner in which the israelites dealt with the people of canaan that any other nations have a right to pursue the same method neither can we imagine that st pauls exhortation to servants or slaves upon their conversion to continue in the state in which christianity found them affords any argument favorable to the practice here pleaded for it is no more than saying that christianity did not particularly enter into the regulations of civil society at that time that it taught persons to be contented and diligent in their stations but certainly it did not forbid them in a proper and lawful way if it was in their power to render their circumstances more comfortable upon the whole we must own that this little treatise is not convincing to us though as different persons are differently affected by the same considerations it may prove more satisfactory to others  in another place they observe since we are all brethren and god has given to all men a natural right to liberty we allow of no slavery among us unless a person forfeits his freedom by his crimes  that slavery is not consistent with the english constitution nor admissable in great britain appears evidently by the late solemn determination in the court of kings bench at westminster in the case of james somerset the negro and why it should be revived and continued in the colonies peopled by the descendents of britain and blessed with sentiments as truly noble and free as any of their fellow subjects in the mother country is not easily conceived nor can the distinction be well founded  if natural rights such as life and liberty receive no additional strength from municipal laws nor any human legistature has power to abridge or destroy them unless the owner commits some act that amounts to a forfeiture a   blackstones commentaries    if the natural liberty of mankind consists properly in a power of acting as one thinks fit without any restraint or control unless by the law of nature being a right inherent in us by birth and one of the gifts of god to man

ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them at the same time declaring for this is the law and the law and the prophets a matt vii    and if our forefathers who emigrated from england hither brought with them all the rights liberties and privileges of the british constitution which has of late years been often asserted and repeatedly contended for by americans why is it that the poor sooty african meets with so different a measure of justice in england and america as to be adjudged free in the one and in the other held in the most abject slavery  we are expressly restrained from making laws repugnant to and directed to fashion them as nearly as may be agreeable to the laws of england hence and because of its total inconsistency with the principles of the constitution neither in england or any of the colonies is there one law directly in favor of or enacting slavery but by a kind of sidewind admitting its existence though only founded on a barbarous custom originated by foreigners attempt its regulation how far the point litigated in james somersets case would bear a sober candid discussion before an impartial judicature in the colonies i cannot determine but for the credit of my country should hope it would meet with a like decision that it might appear and be known that liberty in america is not a partial privilege but extends to every individual in it  i might here in the language of the famous james otis esquire ask is it possible for a man to have a natural right to make a slave of himself or his posterity what man is or ever was born free if every man is not can a father supersede the laws of nature is not every man born as free by nature as his father a   american tracts by otis   there can be no prescription old enough to supersede the law of nature and the grant of god almighty who has given to every man a natural right to be free b american tracts by otis    the colonists are by the law of nature free born as indeed all men are white or black no better reason can be given for the enslaving those of any color than such as baron montesquieu has humourously assigned as the foundation of that cruel slavery exercised over the poor ethiopeans which threatens one day to reduce both europe and america to the ignorance and barbarity of the darkest ages does it follow that it is right to enslave a man because he is black will short curled hair like wool instead of christians hair as it is called by those whose hearts are hard as the nether millstone help the argument can any logical inference in favor of slavery be drawn from a flat nose a long or a short face nothing better can be said in favor of a trade that is the most shocking violation of the laws of nature has a direct tendency to diminish every idea of the inestimable value of liberty and makes every dealer in it a tyrant from the director of an african company to the petty chapman in needles and pins on the unhappy coast a american tracts         to those who think slavery founded in scripture a careful and attentive perusal of the sacred writings would contribute more than any thing to eradicate the error they will not find even the name of slave once mentioned therein and applied to a servitude to be continued from parent to child in perpetuity with approbation  the term used on the occasion in the sacred text is servant and upon a fair construction of those writings there is no necessity nor can the service consistent with the whole tenor of the scripture be extended further than the generation spoken of it was never intended to include the posterity  thf mistaken proverb which prevailed in that early age the fathers had eaten four grapes and the childrens teeth were set on edge was rectified by the prophets jeremiah and ezekiel who declared to the people that they should not have occasion to use that proverb any more  behold all souls are mine as the soul of the father so the soul of the son the soul that sins it shall die  the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son  the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him a jer xxxi    ezekiel xviii     and  0 and the apostle peter assures us after the ascension of our savior that god is no respecter of persons but in every nation he that fears him is accepted of him b acts x    it is also remarkable that at that time an ethiopian a man of great authority c ditto viii    was admitted to the freedom of a christian whatever we may think of the color now as being unworthy of it  but admitting slavery to be established by scripture the command of the sovereign ruler of the universe whose eye takes in all things and who for good reasons beyond our comprehension might justly create a perpetual slavery to effect his own purposes against the enemies of his chosen people in that day cannot be pleaded now against any people on earth it is not even pretended to in justification of negro slavery nor can the sons of ethiopia with any degree of clearness be proved to have descended from any of those nations who so came under the divine displeasure as to be brought into servitude if they are and those denunciations given in the old testament were perpetual and continue in force must we not look upon it meritorious to execute them fully upon all the offspring of that unhappy people upon whom they fell without giving quarter to any  many who admit the indefensibility of slavery considering the subject rather too superficially declare it would be impolitic to emancipate those we are possessed of and say they generally behave ill when set at liberty i believe very few of the advocates for freedom think that all ought to be manumitted nay think it would be unjust to turn out those who have spent their prime of life and now require a support but many are in a fit capacity to do for themselves and the public as to these let every master or mistress do their duty and leave consequences to the disposer of events who i believe will always bless our actions in proportion to the purity of their spring but many instances might be given of negroes and mulatoes once in slavery who after they have obtained their liberty and sometimes even in a state of bondage have given striking proofs of their integrity ingenuity industry tenderness and nobility of mind of which if the limits of this little piece permited i could mention many examples and why instances of this kind are not more frequent we may very naturally impute to the smallness of the number tried with freedom and the servility and meanness of their education whilst in slavery let us never forget that an equal if not a greater proportion of our own color behave worse with all the advantages of birth education and circumstances and we shall blush to oppose an equitable emancipation by this or the like arguments  liberty the most manly and exalting of the gifts of heaven consists in a free and generous exercise of all the human man faculties as far as they are compatible with the good of society to which we belong and the most delicious part of the enjoyment of the inestimable blessing lies in a consciousness that we are free this happy persuasion when it meets with a noble nature raises the soul and rectifies the heart it gives dignity to the countenance and animates every word and gesture it elevates the mind above the little arts of deceit makes it benevolent open ingenuous and just and adds a new relish to every better

righteousness exalts a nation so sin is a reproach to any people a prove xiv    hence whatever violates the purity of equal justice and the harmony of true liberty in time debases the mind and ultimately draws down the displeasure of that almighty being who is of purer eyes than to behold evil and cannot look on iniquity b habakuk i    yet he is far from censuring those who are not under the same convictions and hopes to be understood with charity and tenderness to all every one does not see alike the same propositions who may be equally friends to truth as our education and opportunities of knowledge are various as our faces he will heartily confess to any one who shall kindly point it out any error which in this inquiry has fell from his pen there can be but one beatific point of rectitude but many paths leading to it in which persons differing in modes and nonessentials may walk with freedom to their own opinions we may much more innocently be under a mistake than continue in it after a hint given which occasions our adverting thereto for it seems a duty to investigate the way of truth and justice with our utmost ability  a much more extensive and perfect view of the subject under consideration has of late prevailed than formerly and he believes nothing is wanting but an impartial disinterested attention to make still greater advances thus by a gradual progression he hopes the name of slavery will be eradicated by the general voice of mankind in this land of liberty  the mode of manumitting negroes in new jersey is such as appears terrific and amounts almost to a prohibition because of its incumbering consequences which few prudent people choose to leave their families liable to it is much easier in several other colonies in pennsylvania a recognizance entered into in thirty pounds to indemnify the township is a complete discharge in mariland where negroes are so numerous i am informed the master or mistress may at pleasure give liberty to their slaves without the least obligation and be clear of any future burden both these are exceptionable and may be improved proper distinctions are necessary for as the freedom of all gratis might be unjust not only to the public but the slave so any clog upon the owner who gives up his right at an age when he cannot have received much or any advantage from the labor of the individual would be unreasonable the wisdom of a legislature earnestly disposed to do good will i hope be directed to surmount every little difficulty in pointing out a scheme more equal and perfect by steering a middle course and proper care being kindly taken to assist and provide for the usefulness of those deserving objects of benevolence the approbation of divine providence will i doubt not attend such laudable endeavors and crown them with success  that the legislative body of each province in america may give due attention to this important engaging subject and be blessed to frame and establish a plan worthy of the united jurisprudence wisdom and benevolence of the guardians of liberty is the sincere wish of  the editor  an essay on slavery proving from scripture its inconsistency with humanity and religion by granville sharp a reverend author mr thomas thompson m a has lately attempted to prove that the african trade for negroe slaves is consistent with the principles of humanity and revealed religion  from leviticus xxv    to    he draws his principle conclusion viz that the buying and selling of slaves is not contrary to the law of nature for says he the jewish constitutions were strictly therewith consistent in all points and these are in certain cases the rule by which is determined by learned lawyers and casuists what is or is not contrary to nature i have not leisure to follow this author methodically but will nevertheless examine his ground in a general way in order to prevent any ill use that may be made of it against the important question now depending before the judges a meaning i suppose says the american editor the case of somerset which then depended   the reverend mr thompsons premises are not true for the jewish constitutions were not strictly consistent with the law of nature in all points as he supposes and consequently his principal conclusion thereupon is erroneous many things were formerly tolerated among the israelites merely through the mercy and forbearance of god in consideration of their extreme frailty and inability at that time to bear a more perfect system of law other laws there are in the five books besides the ceremonial laws now abrogated which are merely municipal being adapted to the peculiar polity of the israelitish commonwealth on account of its situation in the midst of the most barbarous nations whom the hebrews were at all times but too much inclined to immitate  the universal moral laws and those of natural equity are indeed every where plentifully interspersed among the peculiar laws abovementioned but they may very easily be distinguished by every sincere christian who examines them with a liberal mind because the benevolent purpose of the divine author is always apparent in those laws which are to be eternally binding for it is the reason of the law which constitutes the life of the law according to an allowed maxim of our own country ratio legis est anima legis jenk cent    and with respect to these moral and equitable laws i will readily agree with the reverend mr thompson that they are the best rule by which learned judges and casuists can determine what is or is not contrary to nature  but i will now give a few examples of laws which are in themselves contrary to nature or natural equity in order to show that mr thompsons premises are totally false  the israelites were expressly permitted by the law of moses to give a bill of divorce to their wives whenever they pleased and to marry other women and the women who were put away were also expressly permitted by the mosaic law to marry again during the lives of their for mer husbands  all which practices were manifestly contrary to the law of nature in its purity though not perhaps to the nature of our corrupt affections and desires for christ himself declared that from the beginning it was not so matt xix     and at the same time our lord informed the jews that moses because of the hardness of their hearts suffered them to put away their wives  neither was it according to the law of nature that the jews were permitted in their behavior and dealings to make a partial distinction between their brethren of the house of israel and strangers this national partiality was not indeed either commanded or recommended in their law  but it was clearly permitted or tolerated and probably for the same reason as the last mentioned instance  thou shall not lend upon usury to thy brother etc  unto a stranger thou may lend upon usury etc deuteronomy xxiii     again  of a foreigner thou may exact that is whatsoever has been lent as appears by the preceding verses but that which is thine with thy brother thine hand shall release deuteronomy xv    now all these laws were contrary to the law of nature or natural equity whatever mr thompson may think and were certainly annulled or rather superseded as it were by the more perfect doctrines of universal benevolence taught by christ himself who come not to destroy but to fulfill the law  in the law of moses we also read thou shall not avenge or bear grudge against the children of thy people but thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself leviticus xix     the jews accordingly thought themselves sufficiently justified if they confined this glorious perfection of charity viz the loving others as themselves to the persons mentioned in the same verse viz the children of their own people for they had no idea that so much love could possibly be due to any other sort of neighbors or brethren but christ taught them by the parable of the good samaritan that all strangers whatever even those who are declared enemies as were the samaritans to the jews are to be esteemed our neighbors or brethren whenever they stand in need of our charitable assistance  the jewish institution indeed as mr thompson remarks permited the use of bondservants but did not permit the bondage of brethren strangers only could be lawfully retained as bondmen  of the heathen or more agreeable to the hebrew words  of the nations that are round about you of them shall ye buy bond men and bond maids moreover of the children of strangers that do sojourn among you of them shall ye buy etc  they shall be your bondmen for ever levit xxv    to     this was the law i must acknowledge with respect to a stranger that was purchased but with respect to a brother or hebrew of the seed of abraham it was far otherwise as the same chapter testifies   th verse for if thy brother that dwells by thee be waxen poor and be sold unto thee thou shall not compel him to serve as a bondservant but as an hired servant and as a sojourner he shall be with thee and shall serve thee unto the year of jubilee and then shall he depart from thee both he and his children with him etc this was the utmost servitude that a hebrew could lawfully exact from any of his brethren of the house of israel unless the servant entered voluntarily into a perpetual servitude and let me add that it is also the very utmost servitude that can lawfully be admitted among christians because we are bound as christians to esteem every man as our brother and as our neighbor which i have already proved so that this consequence which i have drawn is absolutely unavoidable the jews indeed who do not yet acknowledge the commands of christ may perhaps still think themselves justified by the law of moses in making partial distinctions between their brethren of israel and other men but it would be inexcusable in christians to do so and therefore i conclude that we certainly have no right to exceed the limits of servitude which the jews were bound to observe whenever their poor brethren were sold to them and i apprehend that we must not venture even to go so far because the laws of brotherly love are infinitely enlarged and extended by the gospel of peace which proclaims good will toward men without distinction and because we cannot be said to love our neighbors as ourselves or to do to others as we would they should do unto us  whilst we retain them against their will in a despicable servitude as slaves and private property or mere chattels  the glorious system of the gospel destroys all narrow national partiality and makes us citizens of the world by obliging us to profess universal benevolence but more especially are we bound as christians to commiserate and assist to the utmost of our power all persons in distress or captivity whatever the worshipful committee of the company of merchants trading to africa may think of it or their advocate the reverend mr thompson  charity indeed begins at home and we ought most certainly to give the preference to our own countrymen whenever we can do so without injustice but we may not do evil that good may come though our statesmen and their political deceivers may think otherwise we must not for the sake of old england and its african trade or for the supposed advantage or imaginary necessities of our american colonies lay aside our christian charity which we owe to all the rest of mankind because whenever we do so we certainly deserve to be considered in no better light than as an overgrown society of robbers a mere banditti who perhaps may love one another but at the same time are at enmity with all the rest of the world is this according to the law of nature  for shame mr thompson  i have much more to communicate but no more time to write  if i had i could draw from the scriptures the most alarming examples of gods severe judgments upon the jews for tyrannizing over their brethren and expressly for exceeding the limits of servitude just now mentioned a this i have since accomplished in a tract entitled the law of retribution etc i must find time however to adopt one observation even from the reverend mr thompson p    viz this subject will grow more serious upon our hands when we consider the buying and selling negroes not as a clandestine or piratical business but as an open public trade encouraged and promoted by acts of parliament for so if being contrary to religion it must be deemed a national sin b if this just remark by mr thompson be compared with the above mentioned tract on the law of retribution wherein the usual course of gods judge ments against nations is fairly demonstrated by a variety of unquestionable examples in the scriptures it will appear that nothing but a thorough reformation with respect to the said national sin can afford us the least room even to hope that this nation may escape the tremendous effects of gods temporal vengeance now dreadfully hanging over us and as such may have a consequence that would be always to be dreaded may god give us grace to repent of this abominable national sin before it is too late  if i have vindicated the law of moses much easier can i vindicate the benevolent apostle paul from mr thompsons insinuations with respect to slavery for he did not entreat philemon to take back his servant onesimus in his former capacity as mr thompson has asserted in order to render bondage consistent with the principles of revealed religion  but st paul said expressly not now as a servant but above a servant a brother beloved a this single circumstance one would think a sufficient bar to the inferences drawn from this epistle in favor of slavery by the reverend mr thompson and others and yet even the learned archbishop theophylact seemed inclined to admit the same supposed right of the master in the preface to his commentary on this epistle where he gives a short account of the use and purport of it and of the doctrines which may be deduced from it he says  thirdly that it is not fit through pretense of piety to draw away servants from masters that are unwilling to part with them but though the apostle declared indeed to philemon the master v    without thy mind would i do nothing etc yet this by no means proves the right of the master but only that the apostle in love and courtesy to philemon desired that the benefit which he required of him should not be as it were of necessity but willingly ver    for the apostles right to have retained onesimus even without the masters consent is sufficiently implied in a preceding verse viz    though i might be much bold in christ to enjoin or command  thee that which is convenient yet said the apostle  for loves sake i rather beseech etc and a further reason for his not commanding is also declared viz that he depended on the willing obedience of philemon having considence said he in thy obedience i wrote unto thee knowing that thou will also do more than i say and yet that which he really did say or require in behalf of onesimus was as strong a recommendation to favor and superior kindness as could be expressed he required him to receive onesimus not now as a servant but above a servant as a brother beloved etc    verse that  if he has wronged thee or owes ought  in which expression even the supposed debt of service may be included put that on my account said the apostle ver    which must be a complete discharge of all the masters temporal demands on onesimus and therefore it is a strange perversion of the apostles meaning to cite this epistle in favor of slavery when the whole tenor of it is in behalf of the slave but there is still a further observation necessary to be made which puts the matter out of dispute  theophylact himself allows that onesimus at the very time he was sent back was a minister of the gospel or a minister of preaching   but that he should send him back again to the service of preaching of which he is a labourer or minister comment on the  st verse page     edit london       which is an office of the sacred ministry not beneath the highest order in the church for it was the principal employment even of the apostle himself  and this opinion of theophylact is corroborated by a variety of circumstances by the epistle to the colossians it appears that onesimus was joined with tychicus therein declared to be a minister all my state shall tychicus declare unto you who is a beloved brother a faithful minister and fellow servant in the lord whom i have sent unto you for the same purpose that he might know your estate and comfort your hearts with onesimus a faithful and beloved brother by which it is apparent that onesimus was joined in the same services to know their estates and comfort their hearts an office that would have very ill become him had he been sent back to his master as a slave or as mr thompson says in his former capacity  who is one of you they that is tychicus and onesimus jointly shall make known unto you all things which are done here coloss iv    in an ecclesiastical commission from the apostle to the church of the colossians at the very time that he was sent back to philemon ludov capellus remarks that these epistles viz to the colossians and to philemon were wrote and consequently sent at the same time and after assigning several reasons for his opinion concludes as follows  ex his itaque says he liquere puto utramque epistolam simul codem tempore fuisse scriptam hist apost illust page    ed genovae      and it would surely have ill become the apostle to send back onesimus then a minister of the gospel to serve his master philemon in his former capacity that is as a slave which is the doctrine presumed in page    of the reverend mr thompsons tract mr thompson as a clergyman ought to have considered that this would not have been for the credit of the gospel ministry but onesimus was not only a minister and preacher but afterward even a bishop which will by no means suit with mr thompsons doctrine the learned bishop fell testified from the authority of the ancients that this onesimus was a bishop onesimus says he in his commentary on colloss iv    servant to philemon a chief man in colosse the ancients say that he succeeded timothy in the bishopric of ephesus and the great archbishop usher makes express mention of onesimus in that bishopric from the authority both of eusebius and ignatius see his little tract de episcoporum et metropolitanorum origin p   ed land      so that though paul mentions to philemon the receiving onesimus for ever  that thou should receive him forever ver    yet it would be most unreasonable to conceive that the apostle meant that he should receive him for ever as a slave the several circumstances i have mentioned demonstrate the contrary   etc so that mr thompson has notoriously wrested st pauls words  in the other texts where st paul recommends submission to servants for conscience sake he at the same time enjoins the master to entertain such a measure of brotherly love toward his servants as must be entirely subversive of the african trade and westindian slavery and though st paul recommends christian patience under servitude yet at the same time he plainly insinuates that it is inconsistent with christianity and the dignity of christs kingdom that a christian brother should be a slave can thou be made freesays he to the christian servants choose it rather for he that is called of the lord being a servant is the freeman of the lord and in like manner he that is called being free is the servant of christ  ye are bought with a price be not therefore the servants of men the apostle indeed had just before recommended to his disciples to abide in the same calling wherein they were called and being servants not to care for it that is not to grieve on account of their temporal state for if instead of thus enjoining submission he had absolutely declared the iniquity of slavery though established and authorized by the laws of temporal governments he would have occasioned more tumult than reformation among the multitude of slaves more striving for temporal than spiritual happiness yet it plainly appears by the insinuations which immediately follow that he thought it derogatory to the honor of christianity that men who are bought with the inestimable price of christs blood should be esteemed servants that is the slaves and private property of other men and had christianity been established by temporal authority in those countries where paul preached as it is at present in these kingdoms we need not doubt but that he would have urged nay compelled the masters as he did philemon by the most pressing arguments to treat their quondam slaves not now as servants but above servants  as brethren beloved  an elegy on the miserable state of an african slave by the celebrated

shall go thither or return home i am yet undetermined indeed no where shall i stay long from england for i had much rather enjoy the bare necessaries of life there than the most affluent circumstances in this country of most wretched slavery which alone would render the life of any humane man most miserable there are four things under the sun which i equally abhor and abominate viz slavery under which i comprehend all cruelty oppression and injustice and licentiousness pride and impudence all which abound here in a monstrous degree  the punishments of the poor negroes and convicts are beyond all conception being entirely subject to the will of their savage and brutal masters they are often punished for not doing more than strength and nature will admit of and sometimes because they cannot on every occasion fall in with their wanton and capricious humors one common punishment is to flea their backs with cow hides or other instruments of barbarity and then pour on hot rum superinduced with brine or pickle rubbed in with a corn husk in the scorching heat of the sun for certain if your judges were sensible of the shocking treatment of the convicts here they would hang every one of them as an infinitely less punishment and transport only those whose crimes deserve the severest death better be hanged seven hundred times than serve seven years here and there is no redress for magistrates and all are equally interested and criminal if i had a child i had rather see him the humblest scavenger in the streets of london than the loftiest tyrant in america with a thousand slaves at his beck   appendix no   a letter from granville sharp to jacob bryant esquire concerning the descent of the negroes sir i have conceived a very high opinion of your abilities by perusing your learned account of egypt and the shepherd kings etc and as you seem to have studied very particularly the history of the cuseans and ancient arabians you can i apprehend easily resolve some doubts relating thereto which occurred to me on reading your book  i had always supposed that black men in general were descended from cush because a distinction in color from the rest of mankind seems to have been particularly attributed to his descendants the cushim even to a proverb can the cushi commonly rendered ethiopian change his skin etc jeremiah xiii    and therefore i concluded that all negroes as well east indian as african are entitled to the general name of cushim as being probably descended from different branches of the same stock because the proverb is equally applicable to both with respect to their complexion though in many respects they are very different but in p     of your learned work where you are speaking of the cuseans in general you say that they are to be found within the tropics almost as low as the gold coast etc as if you apprehended that the negroes on the gold coast and below it were not descended from cush  now sir i shall think myself greatly obliged if you will be pleased to inform me whether you really have any particular reason to apprehend that the negroes on the coast of guinea from whence our plantations are most commonly supplied are descended from any other stock or whether their descent can at all be traced  i am far from having any particular esteem for the negroes but as i think myself obliged to consider them as men i am certainly obliged also to use my best endeavors to prevent their being treated as beasts by our unchristian countrymen who deny them the privileges of human nature and in order to excuse their own brutality will scarcely allow that negroes are human beings  the tracing their descent therefore is a point of some consequence to the subject in which i am now engaged for their defense      i am sir your most obedient humble servant granville sharp old jewry   th octr      jacob bryant esquire appendix no   mr bryants answer to the foregoing letter cypenham  0th octr      sir i most sincerely wish you success in your laudable purpose and am very glad to find in these base times that there is a person who will stand up in defense of human nature and not suffer it to be limited to a set of features and complexion there is nothing i believe in my writings that can affect any argument which you may think proper to urge in favor of those whom you would patronize but to take away all embarrasment and uncertainty i will give you my opinion upon the subject which you have stated to me in your letter in respect to the origin of the nigritae or negroes you seem to think that all who are of that very deep tint which is observable in the natives upon the coast of guinea are the offspring of chus and all black men in general are of the same origin to this i take the liberty to answer that all the natives of africa are more or less swart and even among the negroes there are a great variety of tints from a light copper color to the darkest black all the inhabitants of this vast continent are assuredly the sons of ham but not equally descended from chus for though his posterity was very dark yet many of the collateral branches were of as deep a die and africa was peopled from ham by more families than one it was possessed by some of them as there is good grounds to surmise before the cushites came into egypt we learn from scripture that ham had four sons chus mizraim phut and canaan genesis x v   canaan occupied palestine and the country called by his by his name mizraim egypt but phut passed deep into africa and i believe most of the nations in that part of the world are descended from him at least more than from any other person josephus says that phut was the founder of the nations in libya see josephus antq lib   c   and the people were from him called  phuti by libya he understands as the greeks did africa in general for the particular country called libya proper was peopled by the lubim or lehabim one of the branches from mizraim  chron paschale p     the sons of phut settled in mauritania where was a country called phutia and a river of the like denomination mauritaniae fluvius usque ad praesens tempus phut dicitur omnisque circa eum regio phutensis hierons tradit hebraeae  amnem quem vocant fut pliny lib   c i  some of this family settled above egypt near aethiopia and were styled troglodytae  syncellus p    many of them passed inland and peopled the mediterranean country in process of time after their expulsion from egypt the sons of chus made settlements upon the sea coast of africa and came into mauritania hence we find traces of them also in the names of places such as churis chusares upon the coast and a river cusa and a city cotta together with a promontory cotis in mauritania all denominated from chus who at different times and by different people was called chus cuth cosh and cotis the river cusa is mentioned by pliny lib   c   and by ptolomey many ages after these settlements there was another irruption of the cushites into these parts under the name of saracens query  whether the saracens may not rather be said to be of the line of shem as being descended from abraham  though indeed both the mother and the wise of ishmael were egyptiant and moors who over ran africa to the very extremities of mount atlas they passed over and conquered spain to the north and they extended themselves southward as i said in my treatise to the rivers senegal and gambia and as low as the gold coast i mentioned this because i do not think that they proceeded much farther most of the nations to the south being as i imagine of the race of phut the very country upon the river gambia on one side is at this day called phuta of of which bluet in his history of juba ben solomon gives an account  it is not possible to discriminate at this era of time the several casts among the black nations but i should think that we may be pretty certain that they were not all cushim or cuseans the negroes are woolly headed and so were some of the aethiopes or cushim but nothing can be inferred from this for many of the latter had long hair as we learn from herodotus lib   c  0  we find from marcellmus that the egyptians were crispi and had a tendency to woolly hair so that this circumstance cannot always be looked upon as a family characteristic  this sir is my opinion concerning the people in question which i submit to your consideration merely as matter of opinion for i cannot pretend to speak with certainty it makes very little difference in respect to the good cause which your humanity prompts you to espouse whether the nigritae are phutians or cushites they are certainly the sons of ham and what is more to the purpose they are the work manship of god formed in his image with a living soul as well as ourselves consequently they deserve better treatment than they have generally experienced from those who look upon themselves as more enlightened and possessed of a greater degree of humanity i join with you sincerely in detesting the cruel traffic and am with great truth sir  your most obedient and most humble servant jacob bryant p s you are pleased to observe that a distinction in color from the rest of mankind seems to have been particularly attributed to the descendants of the cushim they certainly were very dark but so were all the sons of ham and it is difficult to say who were the darkest as it was a circumstance depending upon the situation of the people spoken of and upon many occult causes the same family in different parts varied from itself as i have shown from herodotus the sacred writers speak of the cushis complexion particularly because they were most acquainted with it as being very near shem there were several regions called cushan or aethiopia one of which was upon the confines of judaea near amalec and edom but still nearer to midian hence the prophet habbakuh says in a vision  i saw the tents of cushan in affliction and the curtains of midian did tremble c iii v   these were the araba cushitae with whom the israelites were most acquainted of the sons of phut and of the ludim lebabim and other descendants of ham in africa they had probably little or no cognizance excepting only the mizraim and the aethiopians immediately above them to the south of syene with these they were acquainted should it be in my power to give you any farther satisfaction i shall be very proud of your commands        the whole of what you mention that all moors negroes and black persons are from one common stock is most assuredly true if you make the head of that family ham instead of chus one remove higher makes every thing strictly consonant to the truth    appendix no   the regulations lately adopted by the spaniards at the havanna and some other places for the gradual enfranchisement of slaves are to the following effect as soon as a slave is landed his name price etc are registered in a public register and the master is obliged by law to allow him one working day in every week to himself besides sundays so that if the slave chooses to work for his master on that day he receives the wages of a freeman for it and whatever he gains by his labor on that day is so secured to him by law that the master cannot deprive him of it this is certainly a considerable step toward the abolishing absolute slavery as soon as the slave is able to purchase another working day the master is obliged to sell it to him at a proportionable price viz one fifth part of his original cost and so likewise the remaining four days at the same rate as soon as the slave is able to redeem them after which he is absolutely free this is such encouragement to industry that even the most indolent are tempted to exert themselves men who have thus worked out their freedom are enured to the labor of the country and are certainly the most useful subjects that a colony can acquire regulations might be formed upon the same plan to encourage the industry of slaves that are already imported into the colonies which would teach them how to maintain themselves and be as useful as well as less expensive to the planter they would by such means become members of society and have an interest in the welfare of the community which would add greatly to the strength and security of each colony whereas at present many of the plantations are in continual danger of being cut off by their slaves a fate which they but too justly deserve  appendix no   extract of a letter from the author to a gentleman at philadelphia  and surely there needs no argument to demonstrate the weakness and danger of the more southern colonies from the immense multitude of slaves that are forcibly detained therein  the congress have acted nobly in forbidding the iniquitous importation of more slaves but the business is but half done till they have agreed upon some equitable and safe means of gradually enfranchising those which remain no time should be lost in forwarding this equitable measure  and to secure the affections of the negroes assurances should be immediately given of such friendly intentions toward them lest any attack should in the mean while be made in those quarters which might encourage an insurrection i tremble for the probable consequences of such an event for though domestic slavery which i detest from my heart would thereby be abolished yet that effect would be wrought at the expense of public liberty and the tyranny and injustice of private individuals would seem perhaps to be too severely punished by that horrid carnage and implacability which usually attend the conflicts between masters and slaves  let private interest therefore give place to justice and right which will most effectually administer to the public safety  let it be remembered that many of the negroes are natives of the colonies and consequently have a natural right to a free existence therein as well as the landholders themselves i shall not presume to advise the mode of effecting this important and necessary enfranchisement but will only offer a few hints in order to promote the consideration and determination of those who are best able to judge of the matter  suppose the value of every slave now in the colonies was to be fairly estimated by juries appointed for that purpose and the value to be entered under their inspection as a pecuniary debt due from each negroe to his master in a public register for each district suppose also that the landholders who do not occupy all their grounds were advised to divide what lands they can spare into compact little farms with a small wooden cottage to each which should be allotted to those negroes only who are natives of the colony or else have been so long in it that their dispositions are sufficiently known whether or not they may safely be entrusted with their liberty let such negroes hold these small portions of land by leases for a certain term of years and at equitable rents to be paid in such portions of the produce from time to time as shall be thought most reasonable leaving the tenants a moderate gain besides their necessary subsistence to encourage industry and yet so as to yield the landlords a due profit from each portion of their estates besides an adequate allowance to reimburse within the limited time not only the registered price of their quondam slaves but also whatever sums they may have advanced toward the expense of building of implements of live stock of seed etc etc the amount of which ought to be added to the first debt and registered in like manner before the leases are executed by these means the landlords will lose nothing of their wealth and yet the most useful and worthiest of the negroes will acquire a natural interest in the welfare and safety of the community which will insure their assistance against any hostile attempt of the rest other negroes that are not capable of managing and shifting for themselves nor are fit to be trusted all at once with liberty might be delivered over to the care and protection of a county committee in order to avoid the baneful effects of private property in men and might by the said committee be let out as hired servants to such persons as would undertake the charge of them to be paid also in produce toward the discharge of the registered debt for each mans original price and the labourer himself in the mean while to be allowed one day in a week beside the sunday for his own profit or be paid for it according to the mode of the spanish regulations which i before transmitted that he may have an opportunity to acquire a little property of his own which will prepare his mind as well as his circumstances for freedom by enabling him as a member of the community to shift for himself at the time of his discharge by some such regulations as these slavery might be changed into a condition more nearly resembling that of hired servants as no master would be the absolute proprietor of those he employs and yet all reasonable advantages arising from their labor would remain which must occasion a reciprocal improvement in the morality and humanity both of masters and servants and in process of time instead of wretched slaves a new and useful order of men at present unknown in america where every freeman cultivates his own ground only would be established amongst you i mean a hardy body of free peasants serving either as trusty tenants or farmers to improve the estates of landed gentlemen or else as laborious cottagers who might be employed with infinite advantage to the neighborhood wherever established especially if they were encouraged by an allotment of a small patch of land for a potatoe ground or garden with a right of pasture for a little live stock upon some common field in the neighborhood of their little cottages  landholders by this means would have their estates better peopled and improved and yet avoid the guilt and danger of oppression in the mean while the hours of labor should be uniformly regulated to prevent the oppression of avaricious exactors and the danger of discontent and schools should be opened in every district to give the poor laborers and their children some general ideas of morality and religious knowledge which constitute the most effectual bond of peace these regulations i mention only by way of hint you have the same earnest regard for the cause of general liberty and the natural rights of mankind that i have and much greater abilities to defend them and to propose a more perfect system than what is here suggested let me therefore entreat you to consider this matter and to forward as soon as possible some scheme of general enfranchisement because american liberty cannot be firmly established till this is done

introduced contrary to the natural course of things and the constitution of the world it will one day find a remedy even in its excess matters will be fatally brought to a crisis and nature will vindicate her own laws and restore the credit of her equal and just administration to the lasting punishment of those who abused it this will be when the blacks of the souththern colonies on the continent of america shall be numerous enough to throw off at once the yoke of tyranny to revenge their wrongs in the blood of their oppressors and carry terror and destruction to the more northern settlements such a revolution cannot take place in the islands until this period on account of the want of intelligence and communication between the slaves of one island and another and of the easy communication and mutual assistance of whites but an insurrection on the continent once communicated will be an incitement in the islands and a signal for a general and but that every englishman is alike concerned and the planter not peculiarly criminal a merited carnage  nothing can be conceived more destructive more insatiate than the wars which will follow this event they will be every where marked with the most horrible cruelties and the most furious revenge the distinction of black and white which we have so unreasonably made the marks of freedom and slavery will then become the obvious colors of mutual hostility and revenge and it seems likely that these wars may end to the disadvantage of the whites because the blacks as will be presently observed will increase faster and because their nature seems better able to bear the severity of cold than the whites can that of heat  etc  appendix no   a copy of what is said to be the substance of lord mansfields speech in the case of somerset and knowles on monday the   d june in trinity term      the court of kings bench proceeded to give judgment in the case of somerset and knowles upon the return of the habeas corpus lord mansfield first stated the return and then spoke to the following purport which is taken from the second edition of a tract printed in      entitled considerations on the negroe cause so called addressed to the right honorable lord mansfield lord chief justice of the court of kings bench by samuel estwick a m assistant agent for the island of barbados page vii viz  we pay due attention to the opinion of sir philip york and mr talbot in the year      by which they pledged themselves to the british planters for the legal consequences of bringing negroeslaves into this kingdom or their being baptized which opinion was repeated and recognized by lord hardwicke sitting as chancellor on the   th of october      to the following effect he said that trover would lay for a negroeslave that a notion prevailed that if a slave came into england or became a christian he thereby became emancipated but there was no foundation in law for such a notion that when he and lord talbot were attorney and solicitor general this notion of a slave becoming free by being baptized pervailed so strongly that the planters industriously prevented their becoming christians upon which their opinion was taken and upon their best consideration they were both clearly of opinion that a slave did not in the least alter his situation or state toward his master or owner either by being christened or coming to england that though the statute of charles ii had abolished  homage  see a part of my lord mansfields speech printed in the appendix p    of a treatise upon the trade from great britain to africa by an african merchant wherein this word homage is inserted  tenure so far that no man could be a villein regardant yet if he would acknowledge himself a villein engrossed in any court of record he knew of no way by which he could be entitled to his freedom without the consent of his master we feel the force of the inconveniences and consequences that will follow the decision of this question yet all of us are so clearly of one opinion upon the only question before us that we think we ought to give judgment without adjourning the matter to be argued before all the judges as usual in the habeas corpus and as we at first intimated an intention of doing in this case the only question then is is the cause returned sufficient for the remanding him if not he must be discharged the cause returned is the slave absented himself and departed from his masters service and refused to return and serve him during his stay in england whereupon by his masters orders he was put on board the ship by force and there detained in secure custody to be carried out of the kingdom and sold so high an act of dominion must derive its authority if any such it has from the law of the kingdom where executed a foreigner cannot be imprisoned here on the authority of any law existing in his own country the power of a master over his servant is different in all countries more or less limited or extensive the exercise of of it therefore must always be regulated by the laws of the place where exercised the state of slavery is of such a nature that it is incapable of being now introduced by courts of justice upon mere reasoning or inferences from any principles natural or political it must take its rise from positive law the origin of it can in no country or age be traced back to any other source immemorial usage preserves the memory of positive law long after all traces of the occasion reason authority and time of its introduction are lost and in a case so odious as the condition of slaves must be taken strictly tracing the subject to natural principles the claim of slavery never can be supported  these additions in italics between hooks before and after the words the power claimed by this return was never in use here are taken from the notes of a very ingenious and able counselor who was present when the judgment was given  the rest of his notes sufficiently agree in substance with what mr estwick has printed the power claimed by this return was never in use here or acknowledged by the law no master ever was allowed here to take a slave by force to be sold abroad because he had deserted from his service or for any other reason whatever we cannot say the cause set forth by this return is allowed or approved of by the laws of this kingdom and therefore the man must be discharged  upon this mr estwick has been pleased to observe as follows i must confess says he i have been greatly puzzled in endeavoring to reconcile this judgment with this state of it and with my comprehension etc but the writer quoted by the african merchant before mentioned is not so modest in his censure of this judgment nor so honest in his recital of it as mr estwick for he partially conceals the most material part of the learned judges speech because it happens to make against his own wicked cause and tells us by way of excuse for so notorious and partial an omission  that the remainder of the speech is too vague to come into consideration etc p    another anonymous writer author of a pamphlet entitled candid reflections upon the judgment lately awarded by the court of kings bench in westminster hall on what is commonly called the negroe cause by a planter after comparing this judgment of the kings bench with the opinions of the judges holt and powel and those of the attorney and solicitor general york and talbot etc is pleased to reflect thereupon as follows a point says he upon which these great oracles of the law have published such opposite sentiments seems as far as ever from being established upon the solid ground of absolute precision the planters of course have been left says he as much puzzled by this delphic ambiguity as the sages themselves appear to have been in forming their judgments upon the subject the matter having been confounded in this grand uncertainty etc p    but these heavy charges of the want of precision of delphic ambiguity and of being confounded in grand uncertainty etc are so far from being candid reflections as this author would have us believe them that even his own evidence on the proceeding page clearly proves the falsehood and injustice of this censures for he has there given us the effect of that late judgment of the court of kings bench in the clearest terms without the least doubt or difficulty so that the delphic ambiguity of which he immediately after complains must be even according to his own evidence a mere calumny  after reciting the opinion of lord chief justice holt he immediately adds as follows  lord chief justice mansfield says he adds to this effect  that the laws of great britain do not authorize a master to reclaim his fugitive slave confine or transport him out of the kingdom in other words says he that a negroe slave coming from the colonies into great britain becomes ipso facto free  thus notwithstanding the uncandid reflections of this author about delphic ambiguity yet even he himself has without doubt or difficulty declared the certain and unavoidable effect of the judgment delivered by lord mansfield that this author notwithstanding his prejudices and unjust censures about ambiguity has really stated the certain and unavoidable effect of the said judgment will appear by the following remarks upon it  appendix no   remarks on the judgment of the court of kings bench in the case of stewart and somerset by granville sharp this judgment will not appear doubtful and inexplicit as some have too hastily esteemed it if the whole be taken together and the effect of it be duly considered  lord mansfield pronounced the sentiments or judgment of the whole bench and therefore if any thing was wrong the blame ought not to rest on him alone nevertheless if we fairly examine what was said we shall find no room for blame or cavil his lordship said we pay due attention to the opinion of sir philip york and mr talbot in the year       now the purport of that opinion was that the master may legally compel his slave to return to the plantations  lord mansfield modestly declined giving a direct contradiction in express words to the opinion of two such very eminent and learned lawyers but chose rather to condemn it tacitly by the effect of the judgment which he was about to pronounce and therefore he merely recited the opinion without the least comment and proceeded to the determination of the court upon the case before them which is clear and incontrovertible with respect to the main point of the question viz the power claimed by the master of carrying away his slave by force  the power claimed by this return said the chief justice was never in use here or acknowledged by the law now it was certainly the duty of the court to give judgment according to the known laws and not to be influenced by any opinion whatsoever  they acknowledged indeed the having paid due attention to the said opinion but as their determination was diametrically opposite to the assertions in that opinion it is manifest that the court did not think it grounded in law according to which alone they were bound to determine the conclusion of lord mansfields speech contains more substantial and unanswerable reasons for the judgment he was about to give than the generality of his hearers perhaps were aware of for he very ingeniously expressed in the small compass of two short sentences that the masters claim was contrary to three principal foundations of the english law viz nature use or custom and the written law which last also includes two other foundations viz maxims and statutes with respect to the first he said  traceing the subject to natural principles the claim of slavery never can be supported with respect to the second he said  the power claimed by this return was never in use here and thirdly that it was never acknowledged by the law  these seem to have been the reasons of the determination and consequently the court was obliged by the common law which always favors liberty law favors life liberty and dower libertas est res inestimablis jenk cent    law regards the person above his possessions  ife and liberty most etc principia legis et aequit p    to discharge the man from the unnatural and unprecedented claims of his master which was accordingly done so that the true meaning of this determination is rendered clear and incontrovertible as well by the effect of it as by the unanswerable reasons above mentioned  that there is nothing doubtful or inexplicit in this judgment delivered by lord mansfield will further appear by the following report of a case in the prerogative court wherein this very determination on somersets case is expressly cited and the effect of it clearly and fully declared by a learned judge of that court and the propriety of the said judgment has very lately been still further confirmed by a decree also in the high court of admiralty after a very learned and solemn debate concerning the legality or illegality of slavery in england wherein the merits of the question on both sides was fully examined and discussed a short state of the case together with the substance of the decree will be found in appendix no    the offense expressed in this latter case was so flagrantly wicked in all its circumstances and upon the whole was so notorious a contempt of the laws and constitution of this kingdom as well as of natural right and common honesty that all persons who have any regard for justice must be moved with indignation against the authors of the mischief and must wish to see them corrected by some adequate and exemplary punishment instead of a decision against them for the mere recovery of wages in order therefore to prevent any unjust prejudice of well meaning people against the manner of proceeding in this case for redress it is necessary to remark that the negroe did not  apply for redress of these injuries till more than two years after they were committed whereby he was deprived of the satisfaction to which the habeas corpus act would otherwise have entitled him in any of his majestys courts of record viz  to recover his treble costs besides damages which damages so to be given lays the act shall not be less than five hundred pounds that is five hundred pounds from each offender  frm every individual concerned and these seem in the present case to have been more than   or   that had either been  advising aiding or  assisting in so flagrant a breach of the peace and they would likewise have been subject to all the  pains penalties forfeitures losses or dissabilities ordained in the statute of provision and praemunire see my representation of the injustice and dangerous tendency of

behind him a negroe servant crichton the executor was called upon by cay to give in an inventory of the deceaseds goods and chattels which he accordingly did but omitted the negroe  this omission was made a ground of exception to the inventory as being therefore not perfect  upon argument it was said by the council on behalf of crichton that by a very late case in the kings bench of knowles a knowles was the master of the ship who detained somerset by order of mr stewart who claimed the latter as his property and somerset negroes were declared to be free in england and consequently they could not be the subjects of property or be considered as any part of a personal estate  it was answered that the case abovementioned was determined only in      that a b died in      at which time negrees were in some respects considered as property and therefore that he ought to have been included in the account  the judge dr hay said that this court had no right to try any question relating to freedom and slavery but as negroes had been declared free by the court which had the proper jurisdiction that determination referred to them as well at the preceding time as at the present and therefore directed that article in which the negroe was mentioned to be struck out of the exceptive allegation  appendix no    high court of admiralty before sir geo hay knt lld june         case rogers alias rigges against jones  dr win dr bever proctor torriano dr harris dr calvert proctor holman george rogers alias rigges a negro about nineteen years of age had been a servant to several gentlemen in england and in the summer of      being then out of place became acquainted with john latter and john sessins who contracted with arthur jones for the sale of him an assignment was accordingly drawn for that purpose and signed by john latter by which rogers was transferred to messrs mason and jones as a slave for the sum of twelve guineas  some time in august      after the sale above mentioned rogers under some false pretenses was carried on board the ship britannia then lying at deptford of which messrs mason and jones were owners was there detained against his will and that hemight not escape was carried down into the sail room by order of the chief mate and the gratings were put upon him in this confinement he was kept till the ship set sail when he was released and suffered to go about upon deck but not being entered in the ships books as a mariner nor having any particular office or wages assigned to him he was set to work about the ships duty in general till he was appointed as an assistant to the cook which office he executed sometimes as assistant and sometimes as principal cook during the whole voyage the ship first sailed to the coast of africa on the slave trade and from thence to porto rico where he was offered to sale by the captain of the britannia as a prime slave but rogers having found an opportunity of relating his story to the spanish merchants they refused to purchase him he therefore returned with the ship in which he still acted in his former capacity of assistant cook and upon their arrival in the port of london in may      when the other mariners were paid and discharged he was still detained on board against his will  here he continued for some time till he contrived to give the officers the slip and by the assistance and advice of some friends went to doctors commons and applied to mr faulckner a proctor to put him in a way of recovering his wages or some other recompense for his labor mr faulckner accordingly wrote to arthur jones one of the owners for that purpose and rogers being appointed likewise to meet jones at the proctors office was waiting at a public house in doctors commons till sent for when jones seffins and another man came into the house forced rogers into a coach conveyed him back and forced him on board another ship where he was chained to the mainmast till he was released by the deputymarshal of the high court of admiralty with the assistance of mr shea one of his old masters and some other friends who had obtained a warrant to take him out of his confinement  several reasons prevented his applying for redress of these injuries till the beginning of the year      when mr torriano was employed to commence an action against arthur jones as one of the owners for the purpose of recovering the usual wages or some other recompense in lieu thereof  after the usual proceedings the cause was brought for hearing on june         when the facts being all clearly proved as above stated the principal question was  how far the plea of slavery set up by the defendant could be admitted in bar of the demand of wages  it was insisted on by the counsel on behalf of rogers that the kind of slavery here spoken of never had any existence under the laws of england and in support of that referred to the well known case of knowles and somerset before lord mansfield and likewise to a late one in the prerogative court of cay and crichton  the counsel for the defendant argued that till the case of somerset the law of england admitted slavery and in support of this they quoted the authority of lord chief justice hale and in particular the opinions of the lords talbot and hardwick  the decree of the court thereupon was in substance as follows  there are two principal points in this cause said the judge   st whether such a service is proved as stated in the summary petition as to entitle the plaintiff to the wages demanded and   dly whether the plea of slavery shall be a sufficient bar to the claim  with regard to the first it appears by the fullest evidence that the plaintiff had served on board the ship either in the capacity of assistant to the cook or as cook himself during the greatest part of the voyage and consequently was entitled to some recompense for his services but not being entered as a mariner in the ships book nor having any stipulated wages assigned him it being probable that the owners meant to sell him again in the west indies he cannot be allowed any specific sum under the name of wages but as be certainly performed the duty to which he was assigned without any objection to his behavior in it the maritime law clearly gives him a quantum meruit the cooks wages appear to have been l    s   d per month which is more than rogers mast probably could fairly deserve but upon inspection of the mariners contract it appears that there were several negroe boys in the same ship in the quality of apprentices who were allowed from  0 s to    s and   d per month he signified his opinion therefore that rogers might fairly deserve    s per month which he accordingly decreed him from the time of his being first carried on board  with regard to the second point it was urged said the judge that the plaintiff was a slave and consequently was not entitled to any reward for his service at all  the practice of buying and selling slaves the learned judge remarked was certainly very common in england before the case of somerset in the court of kings bench      but however it might have been the law of the royal exchange he hoped it never was the law of england  the opinions of lord hardwicke and lord talbot when attorney and solicitor general have been quoted in support of this practice and have formerly given too much countenance to it though they seemed originally to have been only applied to the difference created by baptism  but by a late determination of one of the ablest judges that ever presided in this kingdom these opinions have been held to be mistaken and unsound and there can be no further doubt that the claim of slavery is not maintainable by the laws of england  the law therefore was the same before the time of the above opinions as since and consequently refers to all sales whatsoever of this nature which are every one illegal and therefore the pretended sale in the present case in      was an absolute nullity and when the allegation stating the sale was admitted on behalf of the owners had rogers appeared under protest upon this point of law it would have been received in bar of the plea  the owners seem to have acted upon a mistaken notion of their right but as the claim of slavery is clearly against the law of this country and as it appeared that rogers had always acted in some useful capacity during the whole time of his having been on board the judge said he thought him entitled to a quantum meruit for his service  which he accordingly fixed as above and condemned the owners in costs which were immediately taxed to the amount of l      s 0 d  appendix no    from the general evening post no  0   june   th      to the editor of the general evening post sir as the

entertainment to your readers i am yours etc  extract of a letter from a person in maryland to his friend in philadelphia  i am so happy as to think as you do with regard to trading in man or keeping him a slave the custom is wicked and iniquitous neither consistent with reason or the laws of god or man poor unhappy slaves particularly those forced from their places of nativity are most certainly deplorable objects of commiseration i never bought more than two during twenty years residence here one proved to be the son of an african prince he was a most comely youth having observed his uncommon good parts i sent him to school and used him like a free man during his stay with me the directors of the african company having enquired and offered a reward for him i by a public act presented the poor creature with his freedom gave him an order for the reward aforesaid and sent him to london from whence the following year he remitted me the same sum he cost me and sundry rich goods to the amount of three hundred pounds and upwards and therewith a letter in his own native language translated by dr desaguillier of cambridge  the next i purchased was an unhappy lad kidnapped from his free parents at the taking of guadaloupe during his stay with me he decayed or pined so much and expressed so sensible a sorrow of cruel separation from his aged parents relations and countrymen that actuated by the unerring good providence which directs us in all our good deeds i likewise set this poor creature free and sent him to his native place providence again would not excuse my being further rewarded for performing this my duty as a christian the truly honest father from the produce of his plantations has made me presents to the amount of fifty pounds sterling with direction to draw upon him for the full cost of the poor youth which i do never intend being more than paid by presents  i write this to convince you that the inhabitants of africa are not such senseless brutish creatures as thoughtless authors represent them to be they undoubtedly are capable of receiving instruction and far outdo christians in many commendable virtues poor creatures their greatest unhappiness is being acquainted with christians the worthy and benevolent writer must mean such christians only as those who carry out with them nothing of that most amiable profession of

little sister and his brother in my good warm country all things are good except the white people who live there and come in flying houses to take away poor black prisoners from their mothers their fathers their sisters and brothers to kill them with hunger and filth in the cellars of their flyinghouses wherein if they do not die fast enough and poor prisoners talk for bread and water and want to feel the wind and to see the great spirit to complain to him to tell him all or to see the trees of his good warm country once more for the last time the king of the white people  prabably the negro meant the captain orders the officer called jack to kill many of the black prisoners with whips with ropes knives axes and salt the governor of thy flying house has been to show that which is to carry me and him to my good warm country i am glad very glad indeed he goes there with wine should he be sick and white people seldom escape being so there because of thee my kind merciful master and good white brother and because he has been good to me and is a very good white man too i will nurse him myself my mother my father my little sister and my brother shall be his brother his mother his father and his sister too he shall have one large heap of elephants teeth and gold for thee my kind merciful master and kind brother and one for himself also but smaller he at present is my father i eat at his house and lie there too upon the bed thou presented me with his woman is my mother and kindly nurses me being very sick of the sea and fire made of black stones i have received a great quantity of gold besides what thou did present me with by means of thy hand writing to the people who are to send me to my country some part whereof i have given to the governor of thy swimminghouse to be sent to thee had i an houseful should send the whole with equal pleasure however thou shall see hereafter that black people are not beasts and do know how to be grateful after thou my kind merciful master and good white brother left me in thy swiminghouse we thy white people and we thy grateful black prisoners were by the great spirit who was angry with us sent by the wind into an immense great river where we had like to have been drowned and where we could see neither sun nor moon for six days and nights i was dying during one whole moon the governor was my father and gave me those good things thou presented me with on my bed he lodged me in the little room thy carpenter built for me thou gave me more clothes than i could carry yet i was very cold nothing availed with poor black prisoner till at last having the great spirit to send me safe to thy house on shore i thought i was carried there  this appears to have been a dream where thou my good white brother did use me with wonted goodness spoke to the great spirit and to his son that i might keep so during the voyage and afterward which they have done for thy sake they will always do me good because of thee my good white brother therefore my kind merciful master do not forget thy poor black prisoner when thou do speak to the great spirit and to his son i do know he will hear thee i shall never be sick more for which i shall be thankful pray speak for my good old mother my good father my little sister and my brother i wish they may be healthy to many very many moons as many as the hairs on thy head i love
