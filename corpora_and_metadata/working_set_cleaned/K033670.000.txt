the journey a fragment price one shilling  the journey a fragment by c churchill  london printed for john churchill executor to the late c churchill and sold by w flexney near graysinngate holborn mdcclxv  the journey some of my friends for friends i must suppose all who not daring to appear my foes feign great good will and not more full of spite than full of craft under false colors fight some of my friends so lavishly i print as more in sorrow than in anger hint though that indeed will scarce admit a doubt that i shall run my stock of genius out my no great stock and publishing so fast must needs become a bankrupt at the last the husbandman to spare a thankful soil which rich in disposition pays his toil more than a hundred fold which swells his store even to his wish and makes his barns run over by long experience taught who teaches best foregoes his hopes awhile and gives it rest the land allowed its losses to repair refreshed and full in strength delights to wear a second youth and to the farmers eyes bids richer crops and double harvests rise nor think this practice to the earth confined it reaches to the culture of the mind the mind of man craves rest and cannot bear though next in power to gods continual care genius himself nor here let genius frown must to ensure his vigor be laid down and fallowd well had churchill known but this which the most slight observer scarce could miss he might have flourished twenty years or more though now alas poor man worn out in four recovered from the vanity of youth i feel alas this melancholy truth thanks to each cordial each advising friend and am if not too late resolved to mend resolved to give some respite to my pen apply myself once more to books and men view what is present what is past review and my old stock exhausted lay in new for twice six moons let winds turned porters bear this oath to heaven for twice six moons i swear no muse shall tempt me with her siren lay nor draw me from improvements thorny way verse i abjure nor will forgive that friend who in my hearing shall a rhyme commend it cannot be  whether i will or no such as they are my thoughts in measure flow convinced determined i in prose begin but ere i write one sentence verse creeps in and taints me through and through by this good light in verse i talk by day i dream by night if now and then i curse my curses chime nor can i pray unless i pray in rhyme even now i err in spite of common sense and my confession doubles my offense rest then my friends  spare spare your precious breath and be your slumbers not less sound than death perturbed spirits rest nor thus appear to waste your counsels in a spendthrifts ear on your grave lessons i cannot subsist nor even in verse become oeconomist rest then my friends nor hateful to my eyes let envy in the shape of pity rise to blast me ever my time with patience wait it is no long interval propitious fate shall glut your pride and every son of phlegm find ample room to censure and condemn read some three hundred lines no easy task but probably the last that i shall ask and give me up for ever wait one hour nay not so much revenge is in your power and ye may cry ever time has turned his glass lo what we prophesied is come to pass let those who poetry in poems claim or not read this or only read to blame let those who are by fictions charms enslaved return me thanks for half a crown wellsavd let those who love a little gall in rhyme postpone their purchase now and call next time let those who void of nature look for art take up their money and in peace depart let those who energy of diction prize for billingsgate quit flexney and be wise here is no lie no gall no art no force mean are the words and such as come of course the subject not less simple than the lay a plain unlabored journey of a day far from me now be every tuneful maid i neither ask nor can receive their aid pegasus turned into a common hack alone i jog and keep the beaten track nor would i have the sisters of the hill behold their bard in such a dishabille absent but only absent for a time let them caress some dearer son of rhyme let them as far as decency permits without suspicion play the fool with wits against fools be guarded it is a certain rule wits are safe things there is danger in a fool let them though modest gray more modest woo let them with mason bleat and bray and cooe let them with franklin proud of some small greek make sophocles disguised in english speak let them with glover over medea doze let them with dodsley wail cleones woes whilst he fine feeling creature all in tears melts as they melt and weeps with weeping peers let them with simple whitehead taught to creep silent and soft lay fontenelle asleep let them with brown contrive no vulgar trick to cure the dead and make the living sick let them in charity to murphy give some old french piece that he may steal and live let them with antic foot subscriptions get and advertise a summer house of wit thus or in any better way they please with these great men or with great men like these let them their appetite for laughter feed i on my journey all alone proceed if fashionable grown and fond of power with humrous scots let them disport their hour let them dance fairy like round ossians tomb let them forge lies and histories for hume let them with home the very prince of verse make something like a tragedy in erse under dark allegorys flimsy veil let them with ogilvie spin out a tale of rueful length let them plain things obscure debase what is truly rich and what is poor make poorer still by jargon most uncouth with every pert prim prettiness of youth born of false taste with fancy like a child not knowing what it cries for running wild with bloated style by affectation taught with much false coloring and little thought with phrases strange and dialect decreed by reason never to have passed the tweed with words which nature meant each others foe forced to compound whether they will or no with such materials let them if they will to prove at once their pleasantry and skill build up a bard to war against common sense by way of compliment to providence let them with armstrong taking leave of sense read musty lectures on benevolence or conn the pages of his gaping day where all his former fame was thrown away where all but barren labor was forgot and the vain stiffness of a lettered scot let them with armstrong pass the term of light but not one hour of darkness when the night suspends this mortal coil when memory wakes when for our past misdoings conscience takes a deep revenge when by reflection led she draws his curtains and looks comfort dead let every muse be gone in vain he turns and tries to pray for sleep an aetna burns a more than aetna in his coward breast and guilt with vengeance armed forbids him rest though soft as plumage from young zephyrs wing his couch seems hard and no relief can bring ingratitude has planted daggers there no good man can deserve no brave man bear thus or in any better way they please with these great men or with great men like these let them their appetite for laughter feed i on my journey all alone proceed
