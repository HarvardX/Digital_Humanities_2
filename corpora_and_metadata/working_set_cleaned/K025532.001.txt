arundel  by the author of the observer  vol i  london printed for c dilly in the poultry mdcclxxxix  arundel letter i francis arundel to charles mortlake london the scene i am now entering upon strikes my senses with its novelty but it does not satisfy my mind bereft of your society and taken off from the pursuit of those peaceful studies in which we were jointly engaged i feel myself at present in a most uncomfortable situation  how it may be when i am more familiarized to the modes and manners of the great world i cannot pretend to say as yet i see no cause to rejoice in the change my father has been pleased to make in the system of my education the alluring promises which dazzled him never struck me with the same force and this establishment which he so greedily caught at has from the first moment he adopted it invariably appeared to me in no other light than as a sacrifice of my happiness to his ambition for if i know myself i am persuaded i am ill qualified for my office and little likely to find either credit or comfort in a state of dependence  i am at a loss to guess what use such small talents as i am endowed with can be of to the great personage whose fortunes i am now attached to my slender stock of acquirements has been purely of the literary sort and having known no other training than in the fellowship of the muses inter sylvas academi i shall be an awkward novice in the circle of the courtly graces  it is surprising my dear charles how much an academic air and address embarrass a man of sensibility in company of a certain sort i am not sure but i shall be obliged to put myself under the hands of some one of those advertising professors who undertake for grown gentlemen and commence a course of private lectures for i perceive there is more worldly respect paid to the accomplishments of the dancing master than to all the learning of the schools  alas my friend the milk of our alma matter which you and i have fed upon is a diet too simple for the strong stomach of ambition the heavy demands which business makes upon the human constitution and the daily drains of pleasure will not be supported on so temperate a regimen nor can all the demonstrations of euclid help you to the solution of one difficulty in the crooked scheme of politics  there are more phoenomena in nature charles than your philosophy can account for the eccentricity of a comet is not to be compared with that in which some beings seem to move in their political as well as moral orbits and though we have a system for the natural solution of the tides of the ocean it would be more than the genius of a newton could perform to explain the tides and turns in the affairs of men  the interior of a ministers house presents a scene for curious speculation every domestic has an air of consequence i cannot bear the mockmajesty of these upstarts they seem waiting to take measure of me by the attention or neglect i may chance to experience from their lord as yet i have had so little of his lordships company though i live under his roof that they have drawn no absolute conclusions for or against me he received me in a manner i have no right to complain of though a little more condescension would have pleased me better the ladies of his family are not in town  two or three humble solicitors have already found their way to my apartment and made suit to me in a style that is painful to my feelings each of these poor languishing expectants would fain have persuaded me into an opinion of my own consequence and how easy it was for me to serve him with my principal i find i must submit to heavy contributions on my patience and pity if i persist in lending an ear to every mans longwinded detail of grievances and yet it is as hard to refuse that consolation to the wretched race of expectants as it is to convince them i have nothing better to bestow but why will men misunderstand their own interest so totally as to be loquacious on such occasions every hour that passes over my head puts me more and more out of conceit with the situation i am in  happy are you my dear friend and happy may you continue to be in the enjoyment of those placid scenes where amidst the society of natures unperverted children you can alternately enrich your mind with the discovery of truth and delight your fancy with the sports of fiction contrasting the severity of your academical researches with all the charms of classic taste and elegance regular hours and temperate meals with the stated returns of your collegiate duties and healthful recreations compose that pure and primitive system of life which you enjoy and i have lost such art the ills which from ambition spring  farewell letter ii the earl to the countess of g i wonder you could expect me today when you might have recollected it was our cabinet dinner and there was little or no chance of my getting down to you in the evening i should however have strove hard for it but we were unluckily pledged to a committee of west india merchants who held us by the ears till it was too late to leave town if nothing unforeseen arises i shall be with you tomorrow but take notice i cannot set out till after my levee is over which will hold till near four oclock  apropos to all this i am to inform you that young arundel is arrived the obligations i was under to his father upon election services engaged me in a promise to provide for his son i have therefore taken him as my private secretary and now find myself encumbered with a raw lad from the university full of greek and latin which i have no use for and possessed as it should seem of no requisites for the place i have promoted him to what shall i do with him if he had dropped from the moon he could not seem more out of his element he is modest respectful and so silent that i have scarce heard the tone of his voice i think to bring him with me to spring grove and turn him over to your ladyship to polish off the pedantic rust of his cambridge education the bishop tells me he is a capital scholar and has carried off all the prizes from his competitors you who have a strong taint of the bluestocking coterie can best judge of that part of his character i who want only a ready penman and a methodical drudge might have been better suited with the first plodding clerk i had picked out of my office  tell louisa i insist upon her being well against the time we meet i expect to find that fresh air cold bathing and the exercise of riding will have repaired the ravages that late hours hot assemblies and full drawingrooms had made in the bloom of youth and beauty  i am told young arundel is a famous musician i shall make him bring his violin with him  good night to you g  letter iii countess of g to the hon mrs dormer spring grove you know my passion for retirement and therefore cannot wonder at the partiality i have ever had for this delightful villa it is now in prime beauty and as the physicians have thought it necessary for lady louisa to take the country air my lord has consented to dispense with my staying any longer in town and i have now been a whole week teteatete with the dear girl who has advanced in her recovery every hour so many are the opportunities i have had of conversing with her and such is the openness of her nature that i am now satisfied there was no ground for the suspicion i had taken up of her having conceived a liking for that gay young libertine sir george revel certainly he was very particular in his assiduities on the night he danced with her at the duchesss assembly and i must confess there was something in her manner and more particularly in her looks which alarmed my motherly anxiety which must be continually awakened for the safety of a young person so full of attractions and withal so volatile as my louisa i really think we have brought her out at too early an age but nothing would put my lord by from having her presented though she had but just completed her sixteenth year and the consequences were easily foreseen surrounded by admirers and followed by a crowd in every place she enters like some public spectacle who can wonder if so young a head grows giddy with the flattery that is paid her and if her health is now suffering by the late hours and fashionable dissipations of a town life but there is no laying any restraint upon my lords unlimited indulgence and nothing is left for me but to lament in silence and obey i must not however forget to acknowledge the relief i sometimes have recourse to and which i am now availing myself of whilst i secretly unburthen my full heart to you and you alone for you can feel for me your friendly pity lightens my load and your better judgment corrects my weakness  i know your sentiments so well upon the subject of music that i am almost afraid to tell you how much her talent in that captivating art is improved i have heard you mention with regret the time which young women are too apt to dedicate to that accomplishment and after all it must be owned a dangerous excellence when it is attained for where the heart is actuated by those tender propensities which are too evidently inherent in louisas nature i must admit that music is very truly though poetically called the food of love and it is not so much the melting cadence of her voice as the expressive language of her eyes which makes me tremble for her during those performances which her fathers vanity is for ever calling for she is really so captivating and so sensitive toward the admiration of those she captivates that if i had any voice in the matter she should not be suffered to display her attractions so promiscuously as she does nor would i indulge her predilection for those soft and tender cantabiles which she generally selects for her performances  i know you think with me on this subject and i also know how well apprised you are of my lords way of thinking and the fruitless attempt it would be for me to oppose it in this as in all things else i must submit to his will and pleasure  but whilst i am writing this his equipage is in sight and i must instantly break off and hasten to receive him  tomorrow i will resume the pleasure i have now suspended  my lord came down to us yesterday in such good spirits that i am apt to think affairs of state have taken some turn more fortunate for his administration than has been usual of late but this i can only guess at as i never know or wish to know any thing of politics and parties no body accompanied him but a young gentleman whom he has just taken into his family as his private secretary he is the only son of dr arundel a respectable clergyman in our county and one whose interest and support were of the greatest service to my lord at the last general election his father educated him for the church my lord says he has brought an excellent character from cambridge and indeed if i may judge upon so short an acquaintance he seems well to deserve it by my lords manner of describing him in a letter he wrote to me the day before yesterday as a raw lad from the university i had formed myself to expect something very awkward and uncouth in his appearance but nothing can be further from it for though he has none of that happy assurance which puts our young men of fashion so entirely at their ease in all companies he has a natural goodbreeding which pleases me much better and his attentions without sinking into servility are of that respectful yet manly cast which seem to indicate a proper understanding of himself as well as others my lord told me in a whisper that he had been greatly pleased with his conversation by the way and that the prejudice of his first appearance had been entirely removed i think added he i shall make something of him in time but i perceive at present he is too highminded for upon my informing him that i should appoint him a proper stipend from my private purse till i could otherwise provide for him my young gentleman truly would not hear of it and contested the point with me in a style that i should never have expected a dependant to make use of i confess to you i was highly displeased with him at first but in the end i passed it over and made allowances for his extreme ignorance of the world imputing it to the pride of mind and selfconsequence which these young academics are apt to contract at the university  to this i seemed to acquiesce by observing that experience would make him wiser but i confess to you i drew very different conclusions in my own mind and much more in mr arundels favor than i ventured to express for it is not my way to oppose my lord in any of his opinions  after coffee was over nothing would content my lord but that louisa must sit down to her piano forte and though the physicians had forbidden her to sing an air was called for and the favorite song in perseo was selected for her performance though it concludes with a braveura that demands more than ordinary exertion mr arundel was soon after pressed to take up his violin and accompany louisa in a concerto this he would fain have declined and spoke so modestly of his talent that my lord seemed disposed to let him off observing to me in a whisper that he concluded it was not worth the hearing louisa in the meantime had turned over her books and picked out a concerto which she told him was a favorite of her fathers and that he must absolutely do his best to bear a part for which purpose she would take it in slower time to accommodate him this command he obeyed without further hesitation and to our great surprise executed it in so masterly a style with such excellence of taste tone and execution as threw my lord into absolute raptures who quite oppressed poor arundels modesty with his applauses it was now in vain to think of stemming the torrent for the harmonious rage had seized louisa as much as it had her father and our young musician sorely against his will was made to accompany her in two of her best songs which i must own he did with so much delicacy of expression as to make even me for the time almost as imprudent as my lord but at the conclusion of the second air having snapt one of his strings as i verily believe by design he had not or pretended that he had not another and so concluded our concert to the great mortification of my lord and the fortunate rescue of louisas exhausted spirits  this morning my lord went early to town having left his young man with us till his return and being sunday and louisas health making it not advisable for her to venture to church we desired mr arundel to read the service to us at home which he did in such a manner as impressed me with regret that talents so adapted to the office he was performing should be diverted to less worthy purposes and thinking as i do of politics and all who are involved in them i pitied the fate of this unhappy victim to dependence and from my heart abhorred the mercenary motives of the father who had withdrawn him from the service of god and sacrificed him to the mammon of ambition  farewell letter iv dr arundel to francis his son son francis as it has now pleased the giver of all good things to crown my humble endeavors with success and to permit me to exalt you to a sphere where your talents may have room for their display and your fortune under prudent care and caution may be finally established to the extent of my most sanguine hopes through the favor of my gracious patron and benefactor the noble earl of g it behooves me to give you such rules for your conduct as may lead your inexperienced youth in the right road to preferment and it will be your indispensable duty to observe and follow these directions faithfully and implicitly at all times and on all occasions as i shall find needful for your government and guidance in the course of life which you have now commenced  recollect child that i have now lived blessed be god to see many days and according to the computation of mans brief pilgrimage may already account myself a man full of years old age and experience are the parents of wisdom and i trust it is no vanity in me to presume i am entitled to some attention on that account having now for more than thirty years without intermission superintended the spiritual welfare of this populous parish and lived in fair repute not only with my own peculiar flock but let me add with all my neighbors round about i must therefore know something of life and i ought to know it for in this period i have looked it through and through  i have studied not only books but men and things and composed many differences and difficulties amongst my contentious brethren hard and intricate in their nature whereby i have done benefit to my fellow creatures and acquired the reputation of much wisdom and discretion to myself  let me tell you therefore in the first place that you ought on no account to have taken on yourself to reply as you did to your noble patron touching the allowance which he generously offered to you from his private purse till such time as he could better provide for you why did you not apply to me for my advice in that particular i should have given you far different and better counsel know you not rash young man that it is both your interest and your duty to refuse nothing can you not comprehend impolitic and improvident as you are that if his noble lordship had paid you from his own pocket it must in reason and the nature of things have quickened his speed to exonerate himself from the encumbrance of your stipend and what is the result of this what but a place in some branch of the revenue or perhaps the portion of a place equivalent at least if not superior in value to the amount of your private pay ah foolish boy well may i exclaim with the poet quale dedisti principium adveniens  but go back to his lordship and humble yourself in his presence peradventure he will treat it as a first offense and receive you to his forgiveness in pity of your inexperienced youth and weakness tell him that i accept this generous tender with heartfelt gratitude and devotion and when you have got it look well to the disposal of it so as i may not be called upon to supply your exceedings but manage your affairs with that economy which will be your best friend through life  i am told his lordships patronage is prodigious inform yourself well of all particulars and be careful to minute down all offices and appointments within his gift in a private book of your own according to their real value and perquisites with proper comments upon the persons of the respective incumbents viz as to age health infirmities connections etc this will be to thee the very manual of wisdom and this i am well assured is the usual practice with dependants in your situation who have any foresight and discretion  be always ready at the call nay at the very nod of your principal study his looks so as to anticipate if possible his wishes before he can give them utterance make friends with all that are of his family or connections none are to be neglected by you not even his domestics for they have much to say and many opportunities to say it in  his lordship you well know is of a lofty nature high in blood rich in honors and replete with power authority and wealth his humor therefore must be your law and in all things you must accord to it if you thwart it you are undone if you sooth it your fortune is made  the countess is a most virtuous and amiable lady respectable for her private and domestic qualities but she has little influence over his noble mind and being altogether detached from great affairs can be of little service to your views and you will do wisely to proportion your attention to her accordingly  it is not so with the young and beauteous lady louisa for she as i can witness is her fathers darling and has much to say let your devoirs to this lovely favorite be dedicated with the most profound devotion herein you will be furthered by your skill and address in music to which it seems both she and your noble patron also are much devoted  let these few maxims suffice for the present they are however though few in number well worthy your attention for their importance weigh them thoroughly in your thoughts write them on the tablet of your heart yea bind them in the spirit of the sacred metaphor as frontlets between your brows and fail not to bear in mind that i am as you deserve  your friend to serve you and your affectionate father joseph arundel  letter v countess of g to the hon mrs dormer i am not sure if i told you in my last that my lord consents to let us remain here for the sake of louisas recovery and as the spring is already so far advanced we shall go no more to town this season which i am most sincerely thankful for and as louisa acquiesces with a good grace in the measure all is well and here we are fixed for the summer  our new acquaintance has been very agreeable to us and really helped us to pass our time much pleasanter than we could otherwise have disposed of it how much did i wish for you to have been of our party for he is absolutely the very best reader i ever listened to if i may judge by the subjects he selected for our hearing he had something more in view than merely to entertain us for nothing could be better chosen and where any explanation was wanting he supplied it in a manner that made us oftentimes more indebted to the commentator than the author it is matter of astonishment to me how so young a man can have stored his mind with such a fund of learning and of so many various sorts for he seems master of all subjects that are thrown in his way but these are matters out of my depth you would be fully competent to pronounce upon his merit and to you i must refer it  we have had no music for he would never put his violin in order and i have now discovered that it was as i suspected nothing but a contrivance to give respite to louisa  this morning i took a long walk with him round our ornamented farm whilst louisa was employed in writing to lady jane from the turn of his conversation i could plainly enough discover that he is not overjoyed by the situation he is thrown into which seems to have been entirely of his fathers seeking and by no means the way of life which he would have made choice of for himself this i own affected me very sensibly and i could not forbear giving him some hints which i conceived might be useful to him in his future views and connections he listened to me very attentively and after a short silence addressed himself to me in the following words   i am much beholden to your ladyship for the kind advice you have given me which i shall not fail to bear in mind but i am afraid lord g will soon repent of the choice he has made for by what you have been pleased to hint to me i perceive there are many more arts and managements necessary in a situation of dependence than i am ever likely to learn or having learnt to carry into practice i have that opinion of his lordships delicacy that i dare say he will never require of me any other sacrifices than the spirit of a gentleman ought in reason to submit to but i am not so sure of other people who may regard even such an insignificant being as i am with an eye of jealousy and i am sensible i never shall be possessed of that convenient patience which can put up with an insult though it were no otherwise to be resented than by the total sacrifice of my interest  believe me mr arundel i replied however commendable these principles are yet as the world is now fashioned too quick a sensibility will involve you in a thousand troubles and i do sincerely wish for your sake i was possessed of those powers of persuasion which might prevail with you to be upon your guard more especially at your outset into life but i have no such powers and can only offer you my good wishes  at these words turning quickly toward me his countenance animated with the most lively blush i must be a monster exclaimed he if i could ever lose the memory of this goodness or prove insensible to the honor you confer upon me and i must beg your ladyship to be assured that there is no opinion can proceed from your lips which i shall not most implicitly adhere to that only excepted which has reference to yourself therein you must permit me very widely to dissent and if it were not too presumptuous a request to make i should account myself most happy and most honored would you suffer me in case of future difficulty provided the affair be not unfit for such a reference to throw myself upon your friendly judgment for advice i blush to make so bold a suit but indeed i am incapable of abusing your condescension and i flatter myself if i was allowed to think of you as of one to whom i was to bring my conduct to account i should never have the heart to do a deed or even meditate a thought that might dishonor my protectress  i must confess the eager manner of his utterance and the unexpected claim he made upon my confidence which to own the truth was somewhat more sudden than our acquaintance warranted and rather out of form in the manner it was introduced threw me into some confusion and i rather doubt if you will think that i deported myself altogether as i ought by assenting to a request which may possibly engage me further as a party in his fortune and affairs than in prudence i should have gone and indeed considering how little influence i have over any person or in any thing was it not in fact a kind of deceit to let him think that such a friend could be of any use to him in life if there had been the least degree of forwardness the smallest shadow of impertinence either in his look or deportment i could have drawn up and however foreign it may be to my nature to assume the great lady i should in that case perhaps have taken it upon me to put him at his distance but in this instance it would have been rank pride and ill nature to have turned a discouraging countenance upon a modest youth whose emotions were simply those of gratitude and respect and i should have abhorred myself had i been capable of attempting it  thus for the first time in my life has your friend been drawn out of that negative insignificance of character which i have so long studied to preserve and surprised into an undertaking which i am as unfit for as my pupil is for a dependant you will smile to think of me in the character of a female mentor me who have no voice in any bodys affairs and hardly dare to advise even my own child as for his connection with my lord i must look upon that as in a very precarious light for unless his violin pleads strongly in his favor i know no other chance he has to find the way to his good graces he will not flatter and he is too proud to truckle to the hangerson that swarm about the great the first scrape he falls into on that account will completely open his eyes as to my want of consequence and show him that he leans upon a broken reed for there i can afford him no help the only use i could be of to him is in difficulties which may arise from my own sex for i should tell you that this young secretary of ours is out of all comparison the handsomest young man i have ever seen and very finely formed withal so that i conclude he will have embarrassments more than enough to struggle with from that quarter but it so happens that upon the only points i could serve him in delicacy must of course prevent him from employing me  poor arundel does not your kind heart feel a pity for him mine does and yours will no less than mine when you see him and know him  farewell letter vi francis to dr arundel i am truly concerned to find you disapprove of my declining lord gs offer if any consideration could prevail with me to accept it your commands would but if i have hitherto obeyed you in all things i hope you will pardon this my first transgression as i cannot do so great a violence to my nature as to take wages from the hand of a master and sink myself to the condition of a hired servant  as to the idea of its operating as a quickener to provoke him to a more speedy provision for me by other means i confess it never entered my thoughts nor do i think i shall ever acquire so politic an attention to my own interest or that any experience will improve me in a species of wisdom which centers so exclusively and individually in myself  if the burden that may eventually fall upon you till some provision shall be found for me is amongst the motives that induce you to enjoin my compliance with the offer in question i think myself fortunate in being able to secure you against those apprehensions for some time to come by the very kind and seasonable supply which my uncles bounty has just sent me amounting to the sum of two hundred pounds and i slatter myself at the same time the manner in which i shall husband this fund will impress you with no unfavorable opinion of my economy  the lessons of humility which you are pleased to bestow upon me i shall strive to profit by i am also sensible how much my ignorance stands in need of admonition and how well qualified you are to admonish but i shall hope to find lord g too noble to demand those abject assiduities which would degrade my character and reflect no honor upon his if i can respect him for his virtue talents and integrity my devotion will go as far as any mans ought to go but if i find him wanting in these qualities i can never pay adoration to rank alone nor flatter power with the sordid view of profiting by what i despise  on all occasions i shall proportion my respect according to the merit rather than importance of the persons i may be concerned with and by this rule as far as i have yet been able to discover lady gs claim will by no means be so slight and insignificant as you seem to think it i embrace with a devoted heart the tender of your fatherly friendship and affection on the condition of my deserving it which i shall study to fulfill by approving myself at all times and on all occasions  your most dutiful and most obedient son  letter vii captain john arundel to francis portsmouth dear frank i have got a small nestegg left in the hands of my agent whose direction you will find in the enclosed order you may crack the shell my good boy and make the most of it if your stomach is not very sharp set it will help out your mess as i make no doubt but your commanding officer has stinted you to short allowance  there is but little stirring in our way or i would do more for you one lucky hit they say will heal many hard blows if ever i should stumble upon good fortune you shall fare the better for it if not you must look out for yourself and they tell me you are now in the track  i hope you dont intend to grow a flashy fellow and learn to turn up your nose at a tar jacket if that is to be your game my humble service to you but i am sure you are too honest a lad for that and so no more at present from your loving uncle  letter viii arundel to captain john arundel i have received your order for two hundred pounds at your agents office and most gratefully acknowledge your generosity to me on this and all occasions i would say much more to you on the subject if i dare but as i know you too well to venture upon professions i shall only assure you that though you have made me rich you have made me frugal as i shall scorn to dissipate the earnings of your valor in an unbecoming manner  i must own your favor reached me in a needful moment for as i had disobliged my father by refusing a stipend from lord g he had punished my pride by revenging himself upon my pocket and i find enough to dislike in my present situation without the aggravation of poverty  alas my dear uncle there is something in my blood that revolts against dependence my ancestors never yet served any master but their king and yet my father would have humbled me to the mean condition of receiving wages from lord g but in vain i would sooner have taken the first honorable grave i could find than his lordships pay and been the first arundel who so disgraced the name  if my wishes could have prevailed i had continued at cambridge where i was pursuing my studies with some little reputation but if that was not to be allowed of why was i not thrown into the army where my uncle the general would have protected me and has been so earnest to place me but you well know his offers were rejected in a manner so disobliging as to occasion such a breach between my father and the head of our family that i am peremptorily interdicted from paying the common civilities of a visit to sir francis who lives within a few doors of lord gs house in town and who i dare believe would be too noble to let me feel any part of the resentment he has conceived against my father  as for you my dear uncle it is now ten years ago since you proposed to enter me on your books and educate me under your own eye in the service which above all others i should have preferred and delighted in but you also met a rebuff and the full half of my life has been spent in regretting a disappointment which it is now too late to redeem whilst i have the cutting mortification to see the whole world in arms against my country and i remain an idle spectator of the glorious contest  what would i not have given to have stood by your side in your late gallant engagement my heart burnt within me when i read of your beating off a ship of so superior a force that she ought to have blown you out of the water had not your resolution and address balanced the disproportion of her strength i have the satisfaction however to hear your conduct applauded to the skies every body is loud in your praises and lord g tells me you are appointed to a new seventyfour and going out upon a separate cruize with an attending frigate may glory and success go with you sure i am the colors which you hoist will never strike at your command to the enemies of your oppressed country  farewell letter ix charles mortlake to arundel trin coll came i find since you my dear frank have left us i am an altered character and no longer worthy any mans acquaintance i am grown insufferably selfish and unsocial is it because i had no pleasantry no merit but what i caught from you could not you be contented with engrossing every public honor but must you strip your friends of their little private modicum of praise and cram their scraps into your wallet i am discovered to be a very dull fellow and every body flies me accordingly perhaps i am a little unreasonable in expecting all the world to love you as well as i do and have wearied out their patience with lamentations for the loss of you  and is the loss only mine is it not yours also alas alas i was in hopes i should have had nothing but the evil passion of envy to get over a little selfishness or so to conquer which i did not absolutely despair of effecting in due time but if i am to be attacked by the generous impulse of friendship if by the shifting of your fortune from happy to unhappy my heart is to endure a like transition from selfish to sympathetic feelings it is more than i can encounter i can never be reconciled to my own loss unless i could reflect that it was to be your gain  have you taken a fair measure of your lot in life have you considered it in its positive in its relative light you are a great adept in theory are you any thing of a philosopher in practice i much doubt it are you quite sure that dependence is such a bugbear is not every man in some points some periods of his time a dependant do we not serve a temporary apprenticeship to every art science and profession in life cannot you submit to go to school above once before you are made a man of what have i to look to that am an cleve of the church must not i expect to work my way through the probationary drudgery of a curacy before i can expect to lie down in the soft lap of beneficed indolence and what are you gentlemen politicians more than the rest of mankind that you alone should be exempted from going through your degrees and start up at once doctors and professors of the untaught mysteries of government happy inspiration if it were so miserable people to be governed by upstarts and empirics if it be not so  for my part i believe every mans temper is mended by dependence as vice is oftentimes corrected by sickness you perhaps will dispute the point with me and contend that he learns to be mean instead of humble to be cunning when he ought to be wise i cannot be answerable for his mistakes i cannot help a silly fellows running into byeways and crooked allies when the open street lies strait before his nose  you may remember i was a stiff antiministerialist before you commenced statesman i have now turned my coat out of compliment to you but it is a compliment that puts no great force upon my conscience for as i could never reason on either side the question from total ignorance of both i have only transferred my wishes from one party to the other without knowing where the preference lies and if you have no better advocates than me your cause will be but lamely defended heaven keep our blue gowns and square caps from the contagion of politics  i am lately become exceedingly fond of our physic garden and have commenced a course of botanical lectures thus perhaps whilst you are plucking up the weeds that overrun the political region i shall be employed upon the same task in the natural one and so by our joint labors the worlds unweeded garden in time be culled and the baneful poisons which it now abounds in made medicinal and converted into antidotes  our musical parties languish miserably for want of their leader and whilst our harmonic body is starved by your absence london which has spirited you from us is surfeited with repletion so unequally are the good things of life distributed  i have been up since daybreak and the chapel bell now sets in a summons which you never failed to obey how happy i once thought myself that i was quartered so near you i now pass year windows with a sigh take a pensive turn or two in the cloisters and then sit down to a solitary breakfast or at best with some silent companion from the dead in such society the brain will be sometimes subject to vapors and even visions will arise to delude the fancy something of this sort i have lately experienced but upon sober reflection i find that what seemed at first the visitations of the muse turned out in reality to be nothing more than the effusions of melancholy  farewell letter x arundel to charles mortlake i write to you from spring grove the charming villa of lord g about twelve miles from town  i accompanied his lordship on saturday last who left me here with the ladies for the best reason in the world because he did not know what to do with me himself and they did for their goodnature found a thousand innocent nothings to employ me in and i verily believe it is the employment i am fittest for i find my genius is exactly levelled to this tranquil state of indolence without any of those turbulent vicissitudes of pleasure and pain which agitate the current of more impetuous spirits  i have now experienced for the first time in my life that doing nothing is a very different thing from having nothing to do i perceive there is in the former not only occupation enough for a reasonable man but an art and address in the business which the fair sex whose trifling pleases and whom trifles please understand much better than we do  i have rummaged his lordships library for books i never opened before and made acquaintance with several ingenious essayists and even some novelists who have pleased me not a little these gentry who seem to have been in possession of the secret of writing made easy have taught me how to make reading so hitherto i have been used to sit down to the work as a plowman does to his dinner with a craving appetite and a voracious swallow reading these authors is in the vulgar phrase as easy as cracking nuts they set before you a dessert of various confections which are not calculated to appease your hunger but to amuse your palate if you think fit to open the bauble you discover some little motto or device within which is seldom worth the trouble of getting at it and yet curiosity draws us on from one to another i have turned over abundance of these triflers and have had the good luck always to select something tolerable to fill up an evening hour when we came in from our walk  it is now five days since lord g left us and here we have remained without the interruption of any one visitor till a certain person made his appearance this afternoon of which i shall give you the particulars byandby you will expect i should say something of the ladies i have been living with in so familiar a manner but i am in no humor to undertake it i cannot think it a fair way of proceeding when i am entertained in a family to sit down deliberately and delineate their persons and characters for the amusement of a correspondent or for the silly vanity of being ingenious at their cost how should i know any thing of the characters of these ladies in five days acquaintance i abhor such impertinent affectation and i like it the less for the surfeit i have had of descriptions in my short acquaintance with the novelists their pourtraits of beauty and their daubings of deformity are commonly so overcharged as to give me no idea of nature and i dare say if i was ridiculous enough to try my art upon these ladies after a thousand fine nomeaning flourishes about the matron beauties of the mother and the virgin graces of the blooming daughter you would be no better acquainted with one atom of their persons or manners than you are at present i shall only tell you that the world agrees that lady louisa is very handsome and without having any prejudice for the worlds opinions i believe it is pretty certain that in this particular the world is right as i am much more experienced in music than in beauty i am better able to pronounce upon her accomplishments as a vocal and instrumental performer which without exaggeration are extraordinary and if my good word goes for any thing it is no more than i ought to give her for she had not half the same excuse for the many fine compliments she paid to my scraping  you must know charles i was not half an hour in this young ladys company before i had laid down a rule in my own thoughts by which i mean to govern myself in certain particulars which i have no desire to be very explicit upon even to you and yet i must condition with you to keep sacred from all ears and eyes the little that i say now and for ever of persons more especially and even of things a scribbling telltale is a despicable character and yet i feel as if i could not totally restrain the effusions of my heart when i correspond with you if my confidence with you is ever violated i renounce mankind  for my own part i do not know what love is i never yet measured weapons with him and consequently cannot tell whether he is really that formidable champion he is said to be but as for this young lady we were speaking of though she is my junior in age i suspect she is older in experience of a certain sort i should suppose her to be a perfect mistress of her weapons by the way in which she manages them and if a man can parry the attack of her eyes he will have little to fear from any others i hope it will never be required of me to tell any other girl that she is the most beautiful creature in the world for if i do i shall belie my own senses most egregiously between lady louisa and me there is such an impassable gulf that i shall never be foolhardy enough to venture on it and thanks be to fortune it is too wide for the range of even her shot to reach me across it she is at present a little languid or so for i cannot say she is actually ill but even the languor of a fine lady and especially of such a favorite is a sufficient summons for a consultation of physicians they have very disinterestedly prescribed the air of the country and the sidesaddle and every day evinces the good sense and efficacy of their regimen i have sometimes been obliged to attend upon her on her rides but i have oftener avoided it and prefer to attach myself to lady g as the safer companion of the two with this most excellent lady i have taken many delightful walks and am so charmed with her natural unassuming character that i have no reserve in confiding to her all those sensibilities and emotions which my situation awakens in me even my awkwardnesses and apprehensions have not been disguised from her she condescends to them with the greatest patience rebukes me with gentleness or fortifies me by encouragement there are yet charms enough about her to give an inexpressible grace to every thing she says but it is beauty which interests without enflaming it conciliates the affections without agitating the passions it is lady louisa herself advanced twenty years forward in life and twenty times more soft in manner it is her meridian sun declining toward the west his beams entire their fierceness lost having been little used to the familiar society of women it is almost incredible to relate what a degree of influence this elegant friend has already over me she is to be my counselor and confidante upon all difficult occasions and i feel as if i could never suffer any spot or stain to fall upon my actions for fear they should not be delicate enough for her inspection she has been very earnest with me to instruct her in a few of the easy and most familiar topics of popular astronomy and i have been obliged to comply in return she is teaching me to play at chess but i believe she is much more likely to be a rival of sir isaac than i am ever to be a match for phillidore for i can make nothing of it and if she had not all the patience in the world she would have given me up for an incorrigible blockhead before now  you must know i am so constituted as to revolt from every thing that in the least approaches toward pedantry and cannot bear the idea of being the academic of the company i am therefore a little mortified by this task which lady g has imposed upon me and go about it very awkwardly nothing would serve but i must walk out with her last night after lady louisa had retired to show her the constellations i would fain have persuaded her she would take cold by the nightair but that fetch would not save me and i am afraid i did it with an ill grace at last i have now more objections against it than what affect her health only and i shall not repeat these lectures any more i do not think i am quite old enough nor sufficiently sage to expound the stars to the up cast eyes of a fine woman and there is something ridiculous in my setting up to be the fontenelle of lady g unless i had either the gallantry of a frenchman or the sangfroid of a philosopher  this afternoon a certain sir george revel proposed himself the pleasure of making a visit to these ladies it is astonishing with how easy an assurance a young man of fashion carries off an impropriety of this sort i do not find he is by any means an intimate of the family on the contrary i suspect his acquaintance commenced but a few days ago at a private ball where he had the honor of dancing with lady louisa but this it seems was in his opinion pretense enough for dispensing with forms and in the easy style of modern breeding he coolly rode up to the door dismounted and delivered his horse to his groom little doubting of a welcome  for once he was mistaken and very likely this may have been the first time his vanity betrayed him into a false conclusion but lady g had reconnoitred him at some distance and seemed on a sudden so extremely fluttered by his coming that i could do no less than offer myself for any message she thought fit to send him this offer she accepted and after many apologies desired i would take the trouble to make her excuses to sir george revel for declining the honor of his visit but that she and lady louisa saw no company at that place in the absence of lord g  with this commission i repaired to the hall where my gentleman was reposing himself whilst a servant was employed in wiping off the dust from his boots i addressed myself in as civil terms as i could use in delivering the message i was charged with he looked up in my face without stirring from his chair or moving the hat from his head and with a suitable air of insolence demanded who it was he was to thank for being the bearer of so very civil a message  i told him my name but for any thanks due to me as the bearer of lady gs message those i informed him had been discharged by the sender and none were either owing or expected from sir george revel on this occasion  then sir replied he since your name is arundel and i am to understand you are a gentleman be pleased to go back to lady g and tell her she has found out a very unfit office for a gentleman and that she has done me great honor in the messenger but very little in the message  stop there if you please said i my commission goes no further than to the delivery of lady gs commands i shall carry no insult to a lady nor receive one myself from any man  sir your most obedient servant answered he if your anger is so soon roused upon a very natural observation i shall take leave to suppose that my ladys words may not perhaps have been quite so peremptory as your report of them  sir george i cannot let you take leave to suppose that i am capable of varying one tittle from the truth in any case  how so sir when it is generally allowed that wits have short memories and you who seem to have the malice of a wit may very well have the memory of one too  this retort was rather more than i could bear and thereupon stepping nearer to him i observed to him in a kind of whisper that such conversation was no longer proper for the house we were in and that i must insist upon his stepping out of it with me where i would attend upon him to his horse and take that opportunity of requesting him to inform me where i might have the honor of waiting upon him in town to return the compliment he had just now been pleased to pay me  he reddened at this speech and without deigning to bestow any answer flung out of the house and called for his horse i followed him and before he mounted again desired to know where i might call upon him  what is your reason sir said he for demanding to know where i am to be met with if you want any explanation of what i have said explain to me in the first place who and what you are and satisfy me that you are qualified as a gentleman of birth and independance to call any words of mine into question till that is done i shall hold the bearer of such a message as i have here received in just suspicion and excuse my vanity if i observe to you mr arundel that you must be very young indeed in the world not to know where sir george revel is to be met with but as i leave no tickets of my abode with people whom i dont know and who dont know me you may make your enquiries of my servant here or ask the waiters at the st jamess coffeehouse where i may chance to be as i have a palace guard tomorrow  part of this proud speech was delivered from his horses back and i had only time to tell him he should hear from me when he wheeled about and set off upon the spur i then returned into the house and made a short report to lady g of sir george revels departure without any comment whatever upon his behavior to me  lady louisa who had not been present when i received her mothers message was now sitting with her and took very little notice of what had passed with respect to sir georges visit simply observing that mr arundel had had a very troublesome office she sat in a very thoughtful mood for some time and now and then turned her eyes upon me with a look that i cannot pretend to interpret but am not without some apprehension there might be a degree of disappointment in it and perhaps some little portion of displeasure against me for dismissing sir george though if it was so it was politely concealed for to say the truth it was a countenance more in sorrow than in anger it was not long before she retired to her chamber complaining of the headache and as she chose to be alone lady g and i were left together she pressed me to relate the particulars of what passed between sir george and me and seemed very uneasy left something unpleasant had occurred reproaching herself for having inadvertently accepted of my offer to take her message you can readily believe i omitted nothing to quiet her alarms and she concluded by saying  how could i be so indiscreet to send you to that insolent quarrelsome young man who is the terror of all companies and whose vast fortune buoys him up in all manner of outrages against decency and good manners if any thing ensues to your harm i shall never forgive myself believe me mr arundel when i assure you that i should never enjoy another peaceful moment if i was to turn his sword upon your life  i was just going to seal this letter when i recollected that it may not be amiss to postpone it till tomorrow when i shall most probably tack a codicil to it from london where i purpose to return sir georges visit and slip away before these ladies are stirring  farewell london i add a few words to my yesterdays letter to assure you the affair is settled with this silly fellow and all well you shall hear from me again very shortly  letter xi countess of g to the hon mrs dormer i write to you under the greatest agony of mind an affair has happened between young arundel and that wretch sir george revel which i improvidently gave occasion to i cannot send you particulars for my mind is too much distressed to enlarge upon the subject mr arundel is wounded whether dangerously or not is more than i know for though my lord writes word it is only a slight scratch i am far from certain that he does not conceal the truth from me as my servant davison who saw the poor young man and spoke to him tells me he was all over blood and very faint still he had the generous consideration for my ease to bid davison assure me that his wound was nothing and that he desired i would be under no alarm on his account for that he should be with me in a day or two if lord g would give him leave  now even this does not quiet my fears and i must entreat of you to call upon my lord and inform yourself of the truth which i desire you will not disguise from me but state the case without softening any one particular i would have asked my lords permission to come to town myself but that is become impossible as i am now for the first time seriously alarmed for louisa who is confined to her chamber and so very low that i dare not leave her even for an hour in the day we have carefully concealed from her this terrible fracas for to confess to you the whole sorrows of my heart i am not without my fears that this detestable sir george revel is not indifferent to her and that the great depression of spirits she is under is more the consequence of disappointment than distemper  alas my worthy friend should these suspicions be founded what a deplorable attachment has she made and what an unfortunate mother am i  lose no time i beseech you in giving me correct intelligence of mr arundels real situation when you hear the story you will not wonder at my anxiety for how can i avoid feeling for one whose sufferings i am the cause of  farewell letter xii hon mrs dormer to the countess of g i have obeyed the commands of my dear lady g and have the happiness to assure you of mr arundels safety from the very best authority  i called in grosvenorsquare this morning at an early hour hoping to find your lord at leisure to see me he was so obliging as to let me in and i had a few minutes conversation with him he was very quick in discovering that i had been sent upon enquiries by you and said that though he knew i was a spy he should treat me as an honorable one and give me all the information i was in search of he then briefly stated the particulars of mr arundels rencontre with sir george which though i suspect his lordship to have softened in his relation of it seems to have been a very brutal and scandalous affair at the best  i am sorry to observe to you that lord g disapproves of your message to sir george and thinks he ought to have been admitted i hold it right to give you this hint that you may not be taken by surprise if he should happen to launch out as he is too apt to do when any thing occurs to thwart his wishes  he cannot in his real opinion find fault with the prudence of your proceeding nay he must think it highly becoming but i am afraid his eyes are wilfully shut against the glaring impropriety of sir george revels visit by considerations that do him no honor in my opinion it is clear to me that his lordship would have no objection to a proposal from that quarter the politics of sir george at present are hostile to administration and his parliamentary influence as you must have heard is very considerable so indeed is his property the man in short has every recommendation to a father who wishes to make a match of interest and form and fashion enough about him at the same time to catch the attention of any young lady who chooses her lover by the eye such i should hope will never be the choice of my dear lady louisa surely she will never be the dupe of outward appearances nor submit herself to be sacrificed to ambition and the love of riches her beauty rank and fortune leave her without any plea for precipitation in the affair of marriage and though her youth and extreme susceptibility may seem to lay her open to danger yet she has a kind and faithful friend for ever at her ear whose maternal vigilance will guard her from surprise  when lord g had given me a short account of the affair with sir george revel and made his own observations upon it he called a servant and sent him up to mr arundel to know if it would be convenient to him to receive a visit from a friend of lady gs offering at the same time to accompany me to his apartment i rather stared at the proposal but when the servant returned with an answer from the wounded man that he was ready to receive the honor we designed him and when my lord seemed to make a point of my going with him i no longer hesitated about the matter but suffered him to introduce me to mr arundel who had just been dressed by his surgeon and was lying on a couch  after a few slight enquiries my lord slipped out of the room without my observing him whilst i was in discourse with the surgeon who was desiring me to assure your ladyship that his patient was in no manner of danger and would soon be well i then availed myself of the privilege of an old woman by entering into conversation with mr arundel and i must take the same privilege for telling you that i never yet in my experience saw the person male or female old or young who impressed my heart with so strong and so favorable a prepossession as this amiable protege of your ladyships i recollect in one of your letters that you say in a kind of parenthesis that he is a fine young man whereas if i was to describe him to you it must be as a model of perfection for my part i am no dealer in descriptions because i think they never describe any person or any thing but yet i pretend to be a better judge of human beauty than all the younger and more empassioned beholders of it can be because i can now contemplate it with a most philosophical eye in perfect tranquillity of soul i can look at arundel as an artist at the statue of antinous i am glad i did not think of the dying gladiator for that comparison might have appeared ominous especially as his wound is described to me as being in the selfsame place but i understand it to be a glance with the edge of a cutting sword and not a stab with the point  i thought it necessary to tell him as an excuse for my visit that i came at your request to inform myself truly and exactly of the state of his wound on which account you were under much uncertainty and alarm but i flatter myself added i that i can now set her mind at rest in that particular and i hope you will commission me to tell her at the same time that there are no other consequences to be apprehended from the difference with sir george revel  i confess this was going a little too far and perhaps he thought so for he parried my curiosity in a way that seemed to indicate he was not very well pleased with it telling me that if i thought it worth my while to write upon so trifling a subject as his difference with sir george revel he hoped i would not magnify it into any thing that could give you uneasiness or represent it otherwise than as a thing not worth a second thought of yours i have had the honor added he to enjoy a few days only of lady gs society but in those few have received so many marks of her condescension and kindness that nothing will ever deter me from obeying her commands and asserting the delicacy of her behavior in the affair you allude to in the face of any man who dares to arraign it  this was so palpable an evasion of my enquiry that i could not venture upon pressing it any further and now a visitor being announced i was obliged to cut short my visit and take leave  farewell letter xiii arundel to charles mortlake being now more at ease than when i wrote the short postscript to my last letter i shall satisfy your curiosity as to my fracas with sir george revel which has made some noise and cannot fail to reach your ears as the public prints have got hold of it and are circulating a very lame and erroneous account of a transaction which is even worse than they describe it  i left spring grove in the morning before the family were stirring and repaired to the coffeehouse where sir george informed me he was to be found i recollected he said he was to be upon guard and therefore determined not to go armed to the meeting as i knew his hands were or at least ought to be tied up by the duty he was upon as the occasion of our difference was of so delicate a nature i thought it best to go alone and indeed if i had been disposed to take a friend with me i had none to apply to having put up my horse in the haymarket i walked directly to the coffeehouse and enquiring for sir george sent in my name and desired to speak with him in a private room here i staid a considerable time before the waiter returned and reported to me that sir george revel was at breakfast in the public room and bade him tell me if i had any thing to say to him i might say it there it did not suit him to come out  as i was very unwilling to come to an explanation with so uncivil a man in a public coffeeroom where it was to be apprehended certain names would be used that i was determined should not get out if i could avoid it i wrote him a short note entreating him for obvious reasons to let me see him in private assuring him that i was no otherwise equipt than in my ridingdress unprovided with any means and void of any wish to provoke him to a hostile discussion the impropriety of which i was perfectly apprised of at the present moment as i knew he was upon guard and understood the delicacy of his situation  this note was carried to him and answer brought back that he knew nothing of the writer and should enter into no correspondence with me i might come in or not as i saw fit the master of the coffeeroom now came to me and desired i would not make his house the scene of any further altercation i felt the justice of this requisition and assuring him i would not peaceably walked out still i kept my station before the door expecting when this warrior would bolt nor was it long before he made his appearance leaning on the arms of two officers in their full uniform between whom he had entrenched himself  i immediately accosted him taking off my hat at the same time and desiring he would indulge me with a few minutes private conversation  i will indulge you sir with no private conversation cried he till i am better certified of your pretensions to converse with me at all these gentlemen are my friends and in their hearing you must speak if you have any thing to say to me  sir george revel you have no right to question my pretensions recollecting as you must do in what family we met when you thought fit to put an affront upon me  then go back to your lord and if you are in his service let your master certify for you i shall pay no more regard to what my lady says in your behalf than i do to the affronting message which you brought me on here is  he had now turned the corner of saint jamess place when stepping round and presenting myself in front as he still kept walking on i brought him and his party to a stop on the foot pavement harkye sir said i this language makes all further explanation needless if you do not instantly name a place of meeting where i may have satisfaction for this insult as soon as your guard is over i will protest you for a coward to all the world  coward exclaimed he and instantly drawing his sword made a stroke at me with great violence which passing between my arm and my body opened my side with the blade and beat me on one knee to the ground his execrations were horrid and his passion so enflamed that if his brother officers had not caught hold of his arm i am persuaded he would have followed his blow which in the posture i then was would probably have been fatal my wound bled profusely and a sudden faintness came over me when fortunately an eminent surgeon took me into his house close to which the accident happened a crowd of people instantly collected and the word being passed amongst them that an unarmed man had been cut down by an officer upon guard it was with some difficulty sir george and his companions got into the same house with me  i believe the assassin began now to be very thoroughly alarmed but i saw nothing of him whilst the surgeon was using means to staunch the bleeding as soon as he assured me it was not mortal which from my own inspection i was sufficiently persuaded of i desired to speak with the officers who were in company with sir george and witnesses of the transaction  i have reason to believe they are both men of strict honor and humanity and shall always be forward to render justice to their behavior and expressions on the occasion they lamented that it had not been in their power to stop the perpetration of so base a deed that they were both as much taken by surprise as i myself was that as it was their unlucky chance to be present at the scene it would be their unpleasant task to report the proceeding faithfully as it passed and they feared it must be such a report as would for ever blast the reputation of sir george revel whom they could no longer consider as a brother of the corpse  i told them it was my earnest wish this might be prevented and that the redress i looked for from sir george should affect his person only not his profession i could not pretend to say what the rules of their corpse might require but if any saving could be made of his character without prejudice to mine i was content to give him a chance for preserving the name of a gentleman if it were for no other reason than that he might still be worthy to render satisfaction to a gentleman  the surgeon now interposing i was forbidden to converse with them any longer and having told them where i was to be found they left me with every cordial wish for my speedy recovery and in truth they could not have left me in any hands more likely to cooperate with those wishes  and now my dearest charles as i full well know your ardent soul has wings to carry you to the assistance of a friend i must condition with you in the most serious manner to abide where you are if my life was in danger you are of all men on earth he in whose presence there would be most comfort and in whose friendly arms i could with most serenity resign my breath but there is no danger in my case as for what must follow with regard to my assassin it is not in your line to help me and you are the last person i should wish to converse with on such a subject whilst it hangs in suspense i conjure you therefore as you value my repose not to stir a step toward me but as much as possible to preserve that calm serenity of soul that diffuses peace on all who approach you and makes a sphere of happiness around you of which your glowing and benevolent heart is the center beware how you fix your thoughts too anxiously upon one who is entering upon a turbulent and unquiet world the votary of religion should not too closely attach himself to the dependant on fortune our harmony was uninterrupted whilst we lived together from our childhood we have been inseparable i am taken away and you are left hard indeed would be your condition were your sympathetic heart still to take a share in all the tumults and turmoils that i perhaps am doomed to meet dear charles if it be possible think of me only in those tranquil hours that will give you pleasure to reflect upon and if the story of my life shall prove a tragic one proceed no further than to the opening scenes of the drama and drop the curtain of oblivion over the catastrophe  your temper was the model that i studied yet i could never bring my passions to so mild a quality as yours still your example your society your interchange of soul softened and meliorated my imperfect nature that charming dream is now dissolved the band is broken that tied down my passions and i am let loose upon the world with all my feelings and with all my faults if the sword of sir george revel when it struck at my heart had been permitted to reach it perhaps it might have cut out of the catalogue many a disgraceful item which your generous friendship may hereafter blush to read  i confess to you i feel myself at this moment in an exigency where i want the advice of a friend well practiced in the rules of honor and yet i have none such at hand to resort to my uncle john the hero of our name is not within reach and the brave old general sir francis is not amicus curiae at least i dare not consider him as such for my father  alas for me in the very sadness of my soul i utter it  my father has disgraced himself with me for ever oh charles such a letter such lessons of servility such systematic meanness  but let this secret die with you where he found it how came by it and what stuff it is made of i know not but so it has come to pass that in the series of a family coaeval with the monarchy so noted for a high patrician spirit as the arundels have been there is one link in the chain found of baser metal than the rest and out of that i am tempered  woe for me if you my gallant uncles have not communicated some of your blood you have i feel it in my veins  farewell letter xiv arundel to mortlake one of the officers who was present when i received my wound has been here and informs me that sir george revel has given in his commission and it is thought he will be allowed to resign this he did to stop the enquiries that must else have been made into his behavior and particularly as the transaction passed upon guard consequences might have been serious to him this young officer who is married to one of the most lovely and accomplished women of the age seems a very honorable and amiable character he spoke of my affair with all the just abhorrence that belongs to it he wished to know what i had written to sir george in the note i sent into the coffeeroom and when i repeated the contents which i have transcribed in my yesterdays letter to you he observed that such a conciliating message was a heinous aggravation of the act which followed it that he had been publicly called upon by his brother officers to state all the proceedings but that he had hitherto declined entering into particulars till he had conversed with me and was apprised not only of my present wishes but likewise of my future purposes  i did not hesitate to reply that my future purposes could be such only as were necessary for a man of honor to take and which i presumed need not be pointed out to him  he then said that he felt himself bound in honor to convince me that he was no assessor of sir georges in so scandalous an affair and therefore though he felt a repugnance against urging any man to an act of resentment and had always made it his study to keep out of personal affairs yet if i was not better provided and thought fit to accept his services for obtaining satisfaction of the aggressor either in a peaceable manner if that could be done or by the last extremity if it could not he was heart and hand at my service adding that he owned he should not be sorry to mark to the world his abhorrence of such scandalous proceedings which had roused the resentment of the whole corpse and his more immediately as a party present  in what he had now said he spoke the sense also of the other officer who was in the like misfortune with himself  the modest unaffected air with which he delivered himself and the genuine glow of sensibility and true courage which showed itself in his countenance whilst he addressed himself to me won my heart upon the instant and henceforth i honor him as my friend  but i will never consent to his proposal nor will i rack the feelings of a beloved wife by exposing her husband to danger i accordingly declined the honor he did me and i hope in a manner that expressed my sense of his generosity without wounding it assuring him at the same time that i should take the most public and explicit means of clearing his conduct and that of his brother officer from all possibility of misconstruction  he said he did not expect sir george revel would make any concessions or offer at atonement that he was a man of a ferocious haughty spirit elated with the influence which an overgrown estate gave him and pluming himself on his extraordinary skill and address in the science of the sword he had heard him talk very lavishly of lady louisas charms and throw out very broad hints as if he was secure of being favorably received by her lady g was his aversion but as his parliamentary weight was considerable having two boroughs under his command he made little doubt of his proposals being acceptable to the father of the young lady who knew the importance of his support and the turn which such an alliance would give to his politics in fine this friendly officer advised me if the affair must come to a hostile issue to draw him out upon foreign ground and secure myself from consequences that might under certain circumstances throw me into a very dangerous predicament  with this caution he left me and i need not tell you that we parted with many acknowledgments on my side and repeated good wishes on his  i told you in my last that i had not ventured upon resorting to my uncle sir francis arundel nor did i presume upon the liberty of writing a line to him in consequence of my present situation even his person was not known to me for i believe i had never seen him since i was six years old  judge what my surprise must have been when a servant announcing him by name ushered in a majestic martial figure in the uniform of a general i rose with some difficulty from my couch and as he tendered me his hand pressed it respectfully to my lips  child child cried he return to your couch consult your situation and when you are recovered from the surprise of this unexpected meeting i will speak to you he led me back by the hand assisted in arranging my posture and then with great state and deliberation seated himself at some distance in a chair after a short silence i began to attempt at expressing my sense of the honor and kindness he conferred upon me  why yes nephew cried he methinks it is something more than your neglect of me deserved but i am willing to ascribe it to your diffidence nay i can well suppose you acted under influence of your fathers foolish counsel from whom i have long since and for ever withdrawn my countenance and protection but sir you are now to know that francis arundel will support the honor of his name though it descends upon the son of a brother he has renounced i have beeen told of your affair i see you are wounded and so far the fact is verified report gives it forth that you was unarmed and the act if that be so was the act of an assassin how stands the truth sir let me hear it from your own lips and recollect yourself do you mind me call to mind before whom you speak and do not disguise or qualify your conduct in the minutest particular  with this injunction i immediately complied by giving him a circumstantial detail of the whole transaction from first to last which he heard throughout with the greatest attention  when i had concluded he delivered himself as follows  nephew francis you have been very ill used and at the same time i see nothing in your conduct to disapprove of on the contrary you seem to have deported yourself so far as your account goes as becomes a man of honor what have you now resolved upon as your next step  i then opened to him what my purpose was which i told him i submitted to his better judgment and should gladly be directed by him in any steps he would recommend who so well knew what honor required and what was due to the dignity of a name and family which i hoped i was not born ever to disgrace  whilst i was uttering these words his countenance brightened with joy and starting up from his chair he exclaimed with an oath that i was a boy after his own heart and if i was not wounded he would hug me in his arms that it was not for his age and rank in the army to turn out against such a whipster as sir george revel neither would it become so near a relation as an uncle to go into the field with his own nephew but i should not want a second a gallant fellow one of my own age and as it was a family affair one of my own name and kindred  in short he should introduce his son to me in that capacity who was captain of a troop of light horse and now luckily at leisure for such an expedition we shall then see if this cowardly assassin shall escape unpunished for his insult in the mean time my brave lad take care of yourself and get your skin whole as fast as you can  so saying he got up as if to depart but seeming to recollect himself  harkye frank says he i had like to have forgot part of my errand  perhaps you are unfurnished for this job and i suppose you are not too proud to accept a present from your uncle  on the contrary i replied i shall be justly proud of any favor you are pleased to show me but in point of money i am provided by the bounty of my uncle john  no matter for that said he a few hundreds will not overburthen you nor impoverish me besides you have stepped into a new situation here and though i think we have some claim upon lord g for the support i and my son have always given him in parliament i shall not choose that your appearance in his family shall be that of a needy dependant here my boy take this throwing down three bank notes of a hundred each as an earnest of my good will do yourself justice and you shall never want a friend whilst you and i are alive  with these words he hastened out of the room and was gone before i could make reply or raise myself from my couch to pay him the respect that was due to him  and now my dear charles i have been repeating to you a conversation which in tenderness to your friendly feelings i should not have done had it not been contrasted by one which followed it in so opposite style that you may very well expect a more peaceable termination of this affair than the preceding intelligence seems to threaten  lord g has just been with me to say that at sir george revels request he had an interview with him early this morning in which he had debated the circumstances which gave the first occasion to our quarrel and though he must acknowledge my delicacy in not speaking of them to him and held himself obliged to me for my attention to lady gs desires yet he should have been exceedingly glad that no such rebuff had been given on her part to sir georges visit who though he may not be altogether so agreeable to her ladyship would perhaps have been no unwelcome visitor to others of his family at all events it seemed contrary to good policy as well as good manners to put any affront upon a person of his great fortune influence and connections as for his assault upon me it was an act of violence which though committed under a sudden impulse of passion nothing could justify sir george himself did not attempt to justify it yet he thought it would admit of some allowances for where was the man of spirit who could endure to hear himself called coward and yet keep his sword in the scabbard that he had already shown his disposition toward atonement by putting himself out of his profession and it was now with his lordship to say what else should be done toward the party aggrieved  here i was about to make reply when his lordship stopped me by resuming his discourse in the words which follow  when i state to you that sir george was willing to refer himself to me as a mediator i should not disguise from you that it was implied conditionally in case i should take up his cause upon the first grounds of the quarrel by giving my sanction to the pretensions which carried him to my house you will readily understand where this points  now though i dont pretend to decide upon my daughters inclinations i am free to say that no father be his ambition what it may can object to the fortune rank or family of sir george revel his estate i know to be a vast one and he must have been left exceeding rich in ready money he has two boroughs which are absolutely his own and represents the county he lives in so that his parliamentary influence which has hitherto gone against us is no small object as you must confess in short he is a match for the first lady in the kingdom i am candid with you therefore in saying that if your matter can be accommodated i can have no hesitation in using my influence over lady louisa in sir georges favor upon this condition he is willing to come to terms with you and submits the mediation to me i will never suppose you are so little the friend of me and my family or by nature and principle so devoted to desperate and resentful measures as to withstand a proper and gentlemanly atonement when you may be assured i will never consent to any thing that shall put a force upon your feelings or leave a stain upon your honor you see mr arundel how confidentially i deal with you in this affair you see where my interest political as well as domestic points and it is now in your power by facilitating an accommodation not only to save yourself from almost inevitable destruction but to establish such a merit with me as will render me your effectual friend for life  there is no occasion to tell you all my answer to this you see enough of lord gs wishes to conclude that every thing will be done on his part to terminate this affair amicably and you know enough of me to believe that i am not of a resentful and bloody disposition and would it not be a savage act in me to blast the happiness of so lovely a creature as lady louisa by sacrificing her lover and the man she loves to my vengeance you will also recollect lady gs words when she declared her terrors about the consequences that might ensue she should never taste another peaceful moment in her life  can i destroy the peace of the best of human beings you are sure i cannot  set your mind at rest therefore about my future safety and dream no more of duels  i am and shall continue to be yours  letter xv charles mortlake to arundel ah my friend do you deal fairly with me and can you think me so shallowsighted as not to detect your effort at deceiving me is the last paragraph of your letter the real language of your heart it is not why did you suppress your answer to lord gs harangue about amicable satisfaction why but because that answer would have cut up the false delusive hopes which his discourse is intended to convey but you are mistaken it conveys no hopes to me i know you too well to believe he has any interest to divert your mind from the most rigid adherence to those sanguinary laws which honor that moloch of the worlds idolatry has imposed upon its votaries how often have you and i disputed this point of duelling and how little have i ever gained upon your mind by those conversations you have now introduced a new character on the scene your uncle the general who seems a master of the art a professor of modern honor and i perceive the malady is in your blood a kind of family disease not to be eradicated by my lords feeble emollients no my dear frank you throw a very thin cover upon the real purpose of you heart when you affect to ask if it would not be a savage act to blast the character of lady louisa this is not your natural language truth makes no parade and your understanding would not stoop to such trite unmeaning questions if you was as willing to do as you are competent to discern what is right but that your question insincere as it is may not stand unanswered by me i do say that it is a savage act to blast the happiness even of a person who has so small a share of your acquaintance as lady louisa how much more of one who loves you as lady g and yet i am apt to believe there is a heart in which the wound will sink still deeper than in here is a heart which at this very moment throbs with agony whilst it reflects upon the horrid purpose you are meditating  do you suppose i cannot now account for all the time and pains you have devoted to the science of the sword why was you for ever at the practice with your fencingmaster not for the reason you gave me because it was a wholesome exercise a graceful relaxation in the intervals of study you providently made yourself perfect in the theory well knowing that the time was in advance when you must carry it into practice  but i have done what i have said is enough for lamentation nothing that i could add would suffice for conviction and therefore my beloved friend to the protection of providence and the government of your own invincible spirit i commit you may that art you have studied be your defense may that honor you pursue be your reward and may the wound you now suffer be the only one you shall ever receive from the hand of the same murderous assassin  i know nothing of the world you live with their rules and opinions cannot be controverted by me for i have neither age experience rank or pretensions to oppose to their authority i take for granted the assault is such as in the language of honor excludes apology and that the only possible atonement sir george revel can make for attempting to kill you is by giving you a chance of killing him be it so if so the law stands those who acknowledge the law must obey the law at the same time with humble deference to the lawmakers i must observe it is extremely favorable to the assassin as it offers him a second chance of doing that of which he has been once disappointed and when the die of fate is to be thrown gives him two casts to your one  i have hitherto supposed that the laws of our country gave us redress against assaults but when men of principle lovers of justice and who has nobler principles who loves justice more than yourself do not apply to those laws how can i suppose any such are in existence duelling it seems then is the only band of society the safeguard of our personal rights our sole preservative against violence strange paradox this inexplicable to my dull apprehension who cannot for the soul of me discover how that which breaks the peace can preserve the peace how that can defend me from danger which exposes me to death your better knowledge of the world can no doubt expound this riddle and reconcile these seeming contradictions  you forbid me coming to you i will obey you for though nothing would prevent me from flying to your misfortunes i should be an unwilling witness of your errors nor could the world present to me a more afflicting spectacle than a friend endowed by nature with a spirit of benevolence perverted by a compliance with the fashions of the world to a principle of revenge and thinking no atonement complete till the wrong is expiated with the blood of the offender  letter xvi arundel to charles mortlake if the fashions and opinions of mankind were amenable to the laws of reason and religion i admit with you that no such practice as that of duelling could exist perhaps the sword itself might be a weapon out of use or at most be carried peaceably before the chief magistrate of the state or hung up in terrorem as an emblem of justice and not brandished as now by the hand of the warrior as an instrument of human slaughter  but it is one thing to confute the worlds opinions by argument another thing to oppose them by practice now it must be owned that there is something in the term coward so hateful to our ears that it is more than human nature can put up with to submit to the reproach the stigma is so terrible that it is not enough to be conscious of not deserving it the infamy annexed to it is so general that it reduces a man to a state of solitude drives him out of all the comforts all the societies of life and renders him the object of universal contempt if then the world will not hear my reason for refusing a challenge if it will not credit me for those conscientious motives upon which i decline a duel but with one voice and one mind will rise up against me and hiss my scruples out of countenance what shall i do shall i retire to the woods and the groves and shrink from the face of my friends quitting the cheerful haunts of men to feast upon my own meditations in retirement and triumph in the martyrdom of honor at the altar of religion who will do this or grant that there was virtue found in man sufficient for the task will his example profit or reform the world certainly it will not because the world will never impute it to the true principle but universally ascribe it to the mean motives of fear and selfpreservation now if all examples are given us for edification and none can possibly be drawn from mine to what good purpose is my honor sacrificed why am i to separate myself from the great bulk of mankind and seceding upon principle join those who have deserted from cowardice whereby my virtue will be melted into the dregs of their infamy and the good and the bad be made one common mass without use or benefit to any living creature  without controverting any one of your arguments let me ask you if i francis arundel a new and unknown being drawn out of obscurity heaven knows how unwillingly and just stepping forth into the world if i am the one dauntless individual to stem the tyranny of an universal fashion i may retreat you will tell me to my primitive obscurity and hide my head in the oziers on the banks of came but i shall retreat with ignominy i shall grow loathsome to myself i shall lose that conscious pride which is the very soul of energy even my books will be no longer a resource for their authors will rise up in judgment against me every hero will frown upon me as i peruse his annals and every page will strike the blush of shame into my cheeks last of all as the completion of my misery you my dear charles even you the very author and adviser of my undoing you will fall from me and the friend of my life will be ashamed any longer to acknowledge his own melancholy convert  but shall i only plead prescription in defense of what i am doing will not the subject bear the test of argument i am assaulted by a gentleman at the point of his sword wounded struck and publicly insulted as a despicable fellow who has no right to be heard no pretensions to remonstrate upon equal terms of discussion the spirit of a quaker would rise against such an insult what then am i to do patiently bind up my wounds and make him a present of that blood which is nobler than any his veins contain who drew it from me or shall i prosecute for assault and battery and present an indictment upon oath that i was put in bodily fear i tell you charles i will not be perjured by the forms of law when i can be righted by the laws of honor  it is well for society under correction of religion let me speak it it is happy for the order the repose and good manners of the world that they are not left to the regulations of the law alone if i am to put up with every affront that does not break my bones i must divest my heart of every feeling toward truth humanity and candor every sense of justice toward the character of an absent friend every tenderness for my own before i commit myself to a company of my fellow creatures whose offenses could no otherwise be corrected but as they were actionable whilst there is any distinction to be made between a breach of the peace and a breach of good manners something must be found to reach those trespasses which the judge upon the bench can take no cognizance of who will be the protector of the fair sex where will be the shelter for their delicacy what will stop the mouth of obscenity neither judge nor jury what would become of all those misshapen and imperfect beings natures neglected offspring whose infirmities and distortions would make them the butts and buffoons of the rude and boisterous sons of health and vigor if there was not a resort open to them which levels the strongest to the weakest and thanks to that invention which has armed the feeble family of decrepitude with an instrument that can awe the insolence of the bully and can carry death into the breast of the giant from the hand of the pigmy  tell me how many virtues are compounded in your general definition of true politeness and i will prove to you that every one of those component virtues are indebted to the resource of duelling for their place in society let speculation calculate the frays the litigations the disputes the brutal violences that would overthrow society and then compute if the peace order and happiness of mankind would not suffer infinitely more interruption from them than from all our duels which on an average do not rob the community of more than two or three members in the year even morality is interested in the continuance of this check upon the passions and excesses of mankind it is a curb in the mouth of the drunkard for the man who is quarrelsome in his cups learns to restrain his propensity from apprehension of the consequences there are many who will not suffer decency to be too grossly violated none will endure the defamer of female reputation and though the servants of religion are the sons of peace there are some loyal spirits who do not wear the livery of the altar yet will not suffer the god they love and adore to be blasphemed nor the faith into which they are enlisted to be made the topic of ridicule and the butt of ribaldry are there penalties in our statutes for all these various descriptions of offense can attorneys settle all the decencies the decorums of society will a jury find damages for my nerves and can i prosecute for assault and battery upon the sensibility of my heart  read your public prints peruse the bloody page where the vital reputation of your friend is dissected before your eyes for your morning recreation the villain is without the law it cannot reach him the printer defies you it is no libel the author is anonymous why does he conceal his name not because he fears the law but because the coward dare not face your resentment for the lie he has forged and were there no personal resentment to dread the scurrilities of a newspaper would become the talk of the table and the dastardly defamer who now stabs you in a paragraph would insult you face to face and unless there was a lawyer in company you would never know where to lay your damages  take notice i have nothing to say to the gentlemen who fight duels for fames sake is law of no benefit to society because men will resort to it from a litigious spirit personal satisfaction is not to be demanded till peaceable satisfaction is refused and then only when the injury is of a sort which according to the established modes of honor cannot be referred to the law or if referred cannot be properly redressed now it so happens that personal injuries and affronts are generally such as are either too undefineable for the notice of law or too great for its due correction of the former sort the lie flatly given is what no mans spirit can put up with yet there is no legal redress for it whatever of the latter sort a blow is indeed a breach of the peace but the insult does not consist in the violence with which one gentleman strikes another and yet the law will take that only into contemplation which in the sense of honor is no aggravation of the injury on the contrary the very reverse obtains for as in the case of my wound that which injures the person most may very possibly affect the honor least  one more remark your patience will indulge me in with respect to my proficiency in the art of fencing when i professed to study it as an athletic and salutary exercise i did not foresee any other uses i was ever likely to apply it to at all events i had no purposes in contemplation but defensive ones and in that light i must consider it as a happy circumstance that i am possessed of an art which in all probability will enable me to guard my own vitals from an adversarys sword and guide mine where the stroke shall not be mortal  farewell letter xvii lady louisa to lady jane s i am sick my dear jane sick at heart and these silly doctors give me medicines for the body when the malady is in my soul i will take no more potions i can counterfeit no longer their trifling teizes me i will dismiss them and resort to you but tell me first and reflect before you tell me is your friendship for me of that pitch as not to suffer a decline when i have confided to you my weakness will you persist to love me even though i cease to merit your love and when i have degraded myself in your judgment are you incapable of despising me above all things is your nature strong enough to bear the weight that i shall cast upon it when all my present sorrows all that future time may add to my accumulated load shall be deposited with you and you alone remember also that as my case admits of no cure i will admit of no prescriptions when i shall impart it it will not be for the assistance you can give by your advice but merely for the comfort i shall receive in my complaining so far from offering to oppose the poison i shall require of you to feed it to provoke it to inflame it the time for antidotes is past and every vein is saturated with the infection  adieu letter xviii lady g to the hon mrs dormer i am brought to town by the following mandate from my lord   madam you will remove lady louisa to town and come with her yourself the confusion you have thrown me and my family into by the affront you chose to put upon sir george revel at spring grove makes your longer residence in that place unadviseable had you sent your message by a servant i could have turned the blame upon him and in some degree saved you but when you thought fit to employ mr arundel on your errands and gratified your pride by turning my secretary into your footman you took an effectual step for blasting my measures and have made yourself responsible not only for the blood which has already been shed but for all the fatal consequences that may ensue  g   this is a husbands letter to a wife who is and ever has been  let your impartial pen fill up the sentence and describe what how humble how obedient must i add how injured and was it to gratify my pride i employed mr arundel is that the passion i am actuated with toward him alas alas i almost wish it were i have blasted his measures i am responsible for the blood which is and all that shall be shed the former reflection i can survive the latter rends my heart in pieces  well my beloved friend i have done you shall not be wearied with my complaints i will submit and be silent i am devoted to misery the victim of paternal ambition i am lifted up in life to a painful preeminence my heart was never wedded to lord g you know it was not nor his to me for he chose me by the eye it was a match of passion on his part and of splendid unhappiness on mine  no more of this i am in london i have removed lady louisa and have surrendered up my charge so far i have bettered my situation forasmuch as i was distressed in the extreme about her i know not what it is that ails her there is no describing to you the strange appearances her disorder puts on and the variety of changes it undergoes sometimes her dejection is of the most alarming nature she is silent sullen loathes her food and is totally insensible to every thing that is done for her at other times she is feverish wandering her pulse high and rapid and all her motions quick and violent i need not conceal from you how irritable her feelings are and i begin to tremble lest her senses should give way i dare say you have already anticipated my suspicion of the real cause of her disorder love in lady louisas case will be all tumult tempest madness itself and i am by circumstances persuaded she is in love with that assassin sir george unhappy girl to be caught by the glittering exterior of a specious villain as incapable of true love as he is destitute of true courage i noted his behavior at the ball where he first met her danced with her and behaved as i think would revolt a woman of delicacy insensible licentious wretch he knows not what true love should be love should be pure harmless as pilgrims kiffes on the shrines of virgin martyrs holy as the thoughts of dying saints when angles hover over them harmonious gentle soft such love should be the zephyr not the whirlwind of the soul but i tell you again with this wretch she is in love with the direst enemy of my peace with the object of my eternal hatred terror and aversion is the child of my affection fatally in love miserable mother that i am what have i suffered what am i not yet to suffer for her sake i have had an interview with my lord in which he has not only thrown all patience out of sight but distanced every thing that ever went before for violence and rage when i tell you that he did not strike me i tell you the only insult he abstained from tears apologies entreaties had no effect upon him when his overbearing cruelty had lowered me to a state of humiliation which no human creature should be reduced to by another recollection seized me my nature revolted against such meanness and i recovered so much understanding of my own dignity as to break forth into the following expostulation  my lord you bear so hard upon me and press a wounded spirit with such unremitting cruelty that i should be unworthy of the name and character you have honored me with i should be your slave and not your wife if i was any longer to submit myself to your reproaches as i perceive it is impossible to mollisy your heart there is nothing left for me but to attempt to harden mine to an insensibility of your unkindness  with these words i left him and indeed he did not offer at a reply i believe he was a good deal startled to see the trampled worm retort upon its oppressor he is now gone to pay his court to his sovereign to smile and bow and soften his ferocious features into the timid air of flattery and submission whilst i remain at home a silent sufferer under his domestic tyranny  as soon as he was gone i hastened to offer my apologies where they were really due but how different was my reception there he who might justly have complained of his sufferings for my sake would not permit me even to condole with him on the misfortunes which i had brought upon him ah my dear but imprudent friend why would you even touch upon so dangerous a subject as the description of his person loss of blood and the discipline consequential of his wound have indeed diminished the luster but not impaired the sensibility of his countenance the languor that has possessed itself of his features makes them only more interesting than they were i was to blame for not taking more time to compose myself before i saw him for he immediately discovered that i had been in tears nay i am afraid the very tears betrayed themselves for you need not be told how very soon the heart is melted into pity when it has been previously subdued by sorrow and surely it was a touching spectacle to see him stretched upon a couch his body swathed with wrappers his eyes red with pain and his active limbs deprived of their motion he noticed the disorder i was in and in truth it could not be concealed after fixing his eyes upon me some time with the most compassionate and tender respect he shook his head and in a faint tone demanded if this could be the way to cure him of his wound by transplanting it into my own bosom  would it lessen your pain then i replied if i were so insensible as not to participate in what you suffer for my sake  twas an unguarded question he cast down his eyes in silence and no sooner did i see the blood mounting in his cheeks than i felt mine kindle at the recollection of what i said in this moment i had no resource present to my thoughts but to confess i had been in tears before i entered his room my lord had been chiding me severely my unhappiness on finding myself the improvident author of his misfortunes was great enough without any reproaches to aggravate it beyond what i could bear indeed indeed said i he is too cruel to me he oppresses my weak spirits without mercy and i can no longer support it  reproach me not too seriously for this indiscreet confession of what i could no longer suppress and which nothing but the dilemma i was in could have drawn from my lips it is too late to recall it and there is a balm in pity so healing to a wounded mind that i scarce can bring myself to repent of having thus unburthened my heart assured as i am of the honor and discretion of this excellent young man besides you will recollect i told you we had exchanged a promise of mutual confidence when we conversed together in the country he had imparted to me all his feelings upon the first reception he met with from my lord he owned to me that it had given him no flattering impressions of the comforts of his situation and it was plain enough to see he had already taken a pretty fair measure of his lordships character  it is not necessary to relate to you how tenderly he sympathized in my sufferings i confess it drew me on to a more explicit discussion of all the various particulars of my unhappy story as well those which preceded my connection with lord g as all that have since followed what could i do was i to blame for giving vent to my sorrows and how can the human heart support itself without the consolation of some friendly spirit to sympathize with it in it is sufferings if indeed i were not of an age so distant from his and so far out of all danger or even possibility of folly it might be rash and inexcusable to encourage such a connection but i who am nearly old enough to be his mother i who have neither charms to excite desires nor propensity to feel them what have i to apprehend either for him or myself and why should i affect to lay myself under a restraint in his company which would only serve to expose my own ridiculous vanity and give him just occasion to despise me for an old coquette i am determined therefore to treat him with that open confidence which my age and character may safely commit themselves to with one of his modesty and merit and indulge myself without scruple in that pure and maternal affection which my heart has truly conceived for him these and only these are the sensations which my attachment to this amiable youth inspires me with and he in return seems to meet me with the most spiritualized and even filial devotion his attentions to me are of the most delicate and respectful sort his eyes express the mildest benevolence and every sentiment is dictated by a heart replete with honor purity and generosity his emotions are such as can only proceed from a soul warmed by gratitude and melted by pity surely he is sent to me by the indulgence of heaven as a kind of guardian spirit to support and comfort me in this extremity to fill your place my beloved friend and to supply those resources of which i am deprived whilst you are at a distance from me  when i repeated to him all the cruel things my lord had said to me though i could easily discover the effect they had upon him by the changes which his countenance underwent still he did not suffer a single word of aggravation to escape him but suggested every thing he could devise that was soothing and conciliatory observing to me that there must be a variety of incidents of which i was not apprized but to which my lord by his situation was exposed that might ruffle and disturb his temper and that allowances should be made for all men involved as he was in difficult and intricate affairs  perhaps added he lord g had adopted other thoughts and opinions with respect to sir george revels attachment to lady louisa than you had and as his pretensions of a certain sort are as high as any mans it is not unlikely but my lord may be disposed to his alliance which indeed in point of policy there can be no objection to neither is there perhaps any disinclination to be apprehended on the part of the young lady herself  there answered i you touch upon a point that gives me very serious alarm for i can foresee nothing but inevitable misery to my daughter with such a man and yet i fear she is attached to him too seriously to be diverted from it by any thing i might venture to oppose in the way of caution  but alas what influence have i or if i had how dare i to exert it in defiance of my lords authority to the contrary  and yet can i submit to see my daughter married to the wretch who villanously attempted to assassinate my friend there is but one way in the nature of things my dear mr arundel by which i can in any degree be reconciled to such a deplorable connection and that depends altogether upon you if you can forgive him if your generous spirit can admit of his atonement and pass this action over as the mere action of a mad man without premeditation or malice i could acquiesce with some patience especially when i reflected that it was the means of rescuing you from further danger and prevented consequences that may otherwise plunge me into misery insupportable the very thought of which fills my mind with horror  i cannot doubt but i accompanied these words with more emotion of voice and utterance than i am now aware of for i perceived they had a very sensible effect upon him i can recollect that i had his hand in mine whilst i was delivering them though i cannot call to mind at what precise moment nor exactly in what manner i had taken it i suppose it was by one of those involuntary actions which escape us in the ferment of the soul when it is agitated beyond the powers of recollection but i can well remember that he regarded me with great sensibility and respect so that i was under less alarm on that account when i recollected the attitude i was in and therefore thought i would not wound his feelings which in his weak condition are alive to the smallest tokens of unkindness by withdrawing my hand disdainfully and hastily on the contrary observing that he was fallen into deep and silent meditation upon what i had been saying to him i recalled him to attention by a sudden yet gentle compressure of my singers as if to awaken him and then demanded  if he could have the heart to leave me exposed to all the reproaches of an enraged husband by pursuing his revenge in which perhaps he might rush upon death and by loading my conscience with his blood drive me to madness  his reply was such as fills me with alarm i confess to you said he that lord g has already moved me to an accommodation with sir george revel and offered his mediation for that purpose toward him i found it prudent to observe some finesse but from you madam i can never hold back any portion of the truth for you command my heart in every honorable sense of the word i will not say that the injury i have received though as deep as can well be is such as absolutely to preclude accommodation for i have no thirst for his blood though it seems he has had for mine but i must fairly confess i have little expectation that sir george revel has magnanimity enough to make that ample submission which may satisfy my honor nor am i quite assured that my lord has all those feelings for my situation which should urge him to exact a proper and sufficient reparation besides this i have put myself into the hands of my uncle sir francis arundel whose resentment on the occasion runs high and whose family spirit will not be atoned by common satisfaction  believe me madam i am penetrated to the heart with the words you have now uttered to defeat the views which your lords ambition may have formed cannot be indifferent to me and to deprive the lovely lady louisa of the object of her wishes if that object were deserving of her would be painful in the extreme but what is shocking to my thoughts above measure worse than death itself and more terrible than all things but dishonor and the stamp of ignominy upon my name and character is to feel myself the author of misery and unmerited reproach to the best and most amiable of her sex to a suffering wife in whose heart unkindness has already planted its thorns oh lady g what would i not endure rather than give occasion of unhappiness and pain to you believe me madam i shall carry the impression of the sentiments which i feel at this moment to the latest hour of my life and so zealous am i to approve the gratitude the veneration i entertain for you that there can be no commands of yours which it is possible for me to disobey but such as would expose me to a contempt that would render me unworthy of a friendship which i value above life itself  pity me my generous my indulgent friend pity me i conjure you for my conduct at this touching crisis and condemn me not if i wanted fortitude to repress the effusions of a bursting heart i had no longer any command over my tears they forced their way and fell in showers exhausted nature sunk under the discharge and if he had not caught and supported me in his arms i should have dropped upon the floor i shudder to think what pain this effort must have given to his wound for when i recovered sight enough to cast my eyes upon him he was very pale and as i thought in danger of fainting my agonies were now all directed to his present danger i trembled for the mischief i had done i even expected to see the blood start from his wound and pictured to myself all the horrors of his immediate death before my eyes it was too much for human nature to support  i know not what i said i know not what i did nature must answer for it her impulse governed me i was but a machine in her hands he saw my situation and is too noble not to allow for it too pure too virtuous too respectful to presume upon it i will trust his honor for the fairest interpretation and i rest it on your candor to confirm it  no more   farewell letter xix hon mrs dormer to the countess of g what a variety of passions has your letter excited in a bosom which if time had done its duty would before this have been deadened and benumbed by years but it has been the sport the victim of your pen never more will i keep any terms with your unfeeling lord when i had seated you in the full possession of my heart i wished to have reserved a corner of it for him but he is for ever thrust out and excluded let ambition take him in he is not fit for the society of benevolence let pride adopt him let him take refuge in his politics to the angry spirit of party to the tides and tempests of a contentious world i turn him over with disdain whilst he meanly truckles in the presence of princes he is a monster of cruelty in the sacred privacy of domestic virtue oh that you should be destined to call him husband and i not permitted to regard him as a friend  what a contrast have you displayed in the picture of that wounded youth what a revolution do you make in the sensations of my heart when you shift the scene to the chamber of my beloved arundel yes my gentle friend i call him my beloved for i will struggle with you even to animosity for some share in his regards what tell you me of being old enough to be his mother it is no such thing but i am more than old enough to be yours and therefore if age is to be the test of our pretensions the prize to struggle for the plea for friendship how much stronger is my claim than yours fear me not however i shall not be formidable to you a man may not marry his grandmother i shall be contented with a little plain good will you are mistress of his affections  do not start my dear i have not yet said he is master of yours  if arundel will only hear me talk it is all i require of him vanity never totally wears itself out in old age it only shifts its ground mine is as lively as ever but it has been long since driven out of the strong post of beauty and now maintains a kind of dying combat on the field of understanding we chatter nonsense all our youth through and lisp out feeble efforts at wit in our old age now i have a mighty prepossession that arundel will allow me all the charms that i have any chance of being flattered for i intend to make him own that i am a very charming old woman the best teteatete in england and the way that i shall take to make him so fond of my conversation will be by dedicating the whole of it to a delineation of your character yes my most beloved lady i shall be your faithful historian i have known you from your cradle you are all but my own child the modest sensibility of your nature which shrinks back from vulgar observation the inborn virtues of your soul which a husbands overbearing tyranny awes into silence and frights from their propriety are all known and familiar to me  set in a notebook learned and cannd by rote and now what think you of your friend and me shall not arundel and i be good company together which of all the bluestockings will rival me in wit the hags will have no share in him we shall divide him between us you will possess his heart and i shall engross his ear  do you think i do not know to whom i am talking and of what i am talking yes i am talking of the purest passion which the human heart can entertain to a woman of the purest principles i am speaking of love to lady g  but love is prohibited to a wife  did nature make that law will nature obey that law happiness may be prohibited the light of heaven may be forbidden but it must be the edict of a tyrant not the voice of justice which violates the common rights of human kind  who gave the heart those generous feelings which answer to the names of benevolence sympathy compassion generosity gratitude and the whole family of human charities who but the same gracious being who compounding all these several qualities into one essence called it love and then invited all creation to participate of the blessing with this celestial essence thy clay my dearest lady is most liberally tempered to your husband you tendered the first oblations he spurned them from him insensible man but did he therefore extinguish them it was not in his power he crushed the blossoms but he could not kill the root  i trust nobody will tell me that love though rejected shall still be love because it is sanctified by the rites of marriage there must be some mighty conjuration in those rites to overrule the principles of nature before this can be effected but though this will not bear a dispute and it must be on all hands allowed that love cannot be called nor recalled by any form of words yet how many will tell us that a wife though she cannot love her husband ought not to love any other man i shall much sooner be brought to confess the danger of such love than the crime of it but to whom does the danger apply to the weak the vain the unprincipled to them it is danger not because the passion which draws them into danger is love in its true and virtuous character but because it is the counterfeit of love composed of false and vicious propensities why then preach to you whose nature of itself revolts from all impurity is virtue only amiable to us in our own sex shall not courage generosity and other manly qualities have their claim upon our hearts because i am wedded to cruelty shall i love cruelty shall i not prefer and admire the character where gentleness benevolence pity are to be found and if these virtuous attributes chance to be inmates of a heart which the divine artificer has enclosed in a fair and comely mould shall i start aside and call it danger because it approaches me in the shape and likeness of a man no i will embrace and cherish it without fear or hesitation convinced that virtue is of an essence so spiritualized as not to admit of the distinctions of either sex or age and is wherever it resides in its own shape how lovely certain it is that in a fairer tenement than the person of arundel virtue never was or will be lodged it is a rich jewel in a splendid setting and for my part i am not one that affect to be enamoured of those rough diamonds which are only to be known by their hardness not by their luster  by their property of cutting every thing they are tried upon and admitting no impression to be made upon themselves  having thus pleaded for the rights of nature and argued the point with you as her candid advocate let me speak a word on the part of prudence  you certainly should have allowed yourself more time for recollection between your interviews when you passed without any interval from a scene which must have shown your husband in a light so unfavorable to say no worse of it to one which displayed a contrast so advantageous to arundel you certainly did not consult your usual discretion for you came with all the impulses of a bleeding heart fresh and in full force resentment had brokendown your defenses sorrow had undermined them even pity in those moments so soft in itself becomes by circumstance a formidable assailant whilst the angry glances of an insulting tyrant have not yet abated of their impression and the nerves which he had racked are still quivring with the torture how sweet is it to behold the eyes of love glistening with compassion to press the hand of affection reached forth for our relief it is a crisis in which virtue throws away her armor and may she then encounter love in no other form but that of innocence can i wonder that you melted into tears that you sunk upon his neck with tenderness and gratitude that you know not what you said and what you did i cannot wonder if the spirit when it is gone out from the body no longer knows what passes in the prison it has escaped from a thief may steal into the habitation it has deserted and rifle it at pleasure but heaven be thanked arundel is no thief your virtue is reinstated in its citadel the bars and bolts are again made fast and prudence its sentinel is returned to her post  another word or two my lovely pupil by the way of caution  do not tell me of your maternal affection there is hypocrisy on the face of it you have no maternal affection for arundel you can have none have not i the reckoning of your age did not your last birthday number thirty and five years consult your lookingglass think as humbly as you please whilst you survey that face and form which it will reflect upon you and then say to me if you dare that grace and beauty are not present to your view in their tenderest their most touching period the glare of complexion the effervescence of youth are gone by beauty has withdrawn her more brilliant tints from the portrait but sensibility has added ten thousand interesting touches which speak more to the heart than the fresher hus once did to the eye they may indeed awaken less admiration but they inspire more love a shade of sorrow thrown upon the finest features in nature a pensive cast which rather menaces than marks decay only show that time has begun to put his pencil to the canvass not maliciously but feelingly not with an intent to deface it but to soften down its hardnesses and make it is harmony more sweet and mellow  i will tell you another thing which perhaps you are not aware of and this it is  a very young man whose taste is not vitiated by sensuality and whose mind is of the sentimental and pathetic cast will be more captivated by a woman of your ladyships age and style of beauty than by all the florid charms of a girl though she were as attractive as your own daughter apply this to arrundel and you will perceive he is the very man to feel those impressions and yourself the very woman to inspire them talk no more therefore either of your maternal or his filial affections for you cannot deceive me and you ought not to deceive yourself use a plainer language call it love speak without disguise when you speak to me confide to me the most secret movements of your heart tell me every thing unequivocally as it passes not to gratify my curiosity but to relieve your own thoughts to satisfy your doubts to strengthen your resolution to guard and support your virtue  you see i am no stern monitress i can caution you without accusing i can moralize without pedantry i repose entire confidence in your discretion you may with equal security rely upon my honor  farewell letter xx lady louisa g to lady jane s thanks to you my dear jane my best thanks you have banished all my scruples your letter is your heart and your heart is truth itself you are the very comforter i wish for in your friendship i shall find the only cordial that can relieve me  you have heard the sad fracas that has happened as i may say in our family for the quarrel was first started in our house at springgrove all the world says that sir george revel was shockingly in fault but all the world believes i dont think so you was with me at the duchesss ball when i danced with him and can witness how conspicuous his attentions were to me do i call them his attentions sir george revels selfpresumption is much too great to descend to any thing that in the most distant degree can carry an appearance of humility his own dear person is the idol of his worship and he has made it as rich in gold and precious stones as the lady of loretto he is also very fine in the fashionable sense of the word and very insolent in the plain sense of it he said very fine things to me as he might think them but as i know they were only said to display his own wit and address i cared very little about them he persuaded himself he had made a very serious impression and i was sensible he had made a very ridiculous one my father was well pleased for there is every worldly recommendation in the connection my mother was much displeased for she despises money and is insensible to ambition the rest of the good company who were uninterested lookerson and did not care which way the game went married us without loss of time as the readiest way of disposing of us  you yourself my dear jane have been in the general error till this moment when i declare to you from my heart that i scorn and detest sir george revel i look upon him with horror i cannot hear his name without shuddering he is the terror of my very dreams i would sooner leap alive into the flames than marry that most hateful of wretches  notwithstanding this prepare yourself to hear that i am about to do this very thing so much more terrible than the worst of torments oppose not that report even with a doubt give it not so much as a silent shake of your head when you meet it every body knows our intimacy and if you hesitate my hypocrisy will transpire the consequence of that will be that the duel between sir george and mr arundel must take place  ah my dear friend that fatal week at springgrove how little did i suspect when my father told us he should bring down an awkward lad from the university to be humanized in our society that my eyes were to encounter a form where every grace of mind and person every manly charm every captivating talent unite to conquer mr arundel is the son of a younger brother of sir francis arundel whom all the world knows his father is in the church and as his uncle has an heir this young man has very little else to look to but his expectations of being provided for by my father he has the character of being an incomparable scholar and my mother who has had much more of his company than i have is quite charmed with him i cannot say that he takes the way of making his court to my father for he is very highminded and will not flatter the first night of his coming we had music with some persuasion he accompanied me in a concerto to my astonishment i heard a perfect master on the violin and it was a composition he could never have seen before his performance charmed me so that though i was forbidden to sing i was determined he should accompany me in one of my best songs he did it with such delicacy of taste and supported me with so fine a symphony that his tones perfectly inspired me and i was never so much in humor with my own voice before o nature had you not done enough but art must add this accomplishment to make him irresistible  when my father went back to town he left mr arundel with us it was from thence your hapless friend must date her sorrows he was our sole companion all around us was retirement silence tranquillity and a season which conspired with love to assail my too susceptible heart what qualities what sentiments what talents did i then discover as his character unfolded itself to my observation he conversed he read  oh jane there is the very soul of harmony in his voice he walked with us he amused us with a thousand various resources he instructed us by a thousand various ways but with such modesty of nature with so pure a mind with an understanding so enlightened yet so void of pedantry with manners so refined and with a countenance  oh heavens i shall never look upon his like again  as for me seeing as i do the impassable gulf that is between us attracted by nature repelled by fate i stood gazing like a selfdevoted victim on the very brink of ruin measuring with my eye the insurmountable barrier that parted us for ever sometimes i was desperately impelled to the attempt to perish in the gulf methought would be a speedier consummation of my misery than languishing on the bank till suspense and disappointment ended me sometimes i invoked a nobler resolution to my aid i took counsel of my pride i brought into review the nobility of my birth my rank my fortune all the splendors of life that awaited and even solicited my acceptance shall i lower my ambition to take thought of a dependant shall i descend to such obscurity grant for a moment i were abject enough to stoop from such a height to such a depth how should i support the terrors of a fathers wrath how shall i face him whose mildest look never yet relaxed from its authority whose very smile awes me into submission i dare not do it be the consequences what they may i can die but i dare not disobey  fortified with these reflections and made resolute even by my fears i turned aside and sought relief in solitary meditation i confined myself to my chamber i resigned him totally to my mother who seemed no whit less enamoured than myself though doubtless not with my degree of danger not with my tumult of heart forbid it heaven not with my agony of passion  and yet  what am i saying  no she is all serenity and calmness  i am all storm and tempest the government of her soul has ever been a model of perfection orderly correct chastised and pure without a spot or blemish but mine alas my soul  to you my jane and to you only let me pour forth my feelings  what shall i say it is a whirlwind is too tame a word  ah me my poor head turns the tears gush forth my thoughts are lost i must break off and pause for recollection  i will not look back to what i have written i am very ill my dear jane read me with pity not with scorn take me as i am a creature scarce itself they tell me i must go into the south of france for the recovery of my health silly people what has south or north or any point of the compass to do with my health can the air of montpelier breathe peace into my heart is forgetfulness the growth of france can the alps smother affection can they screen me from the vision of arundel yet i will go into the south of france to the farthest land upon the globe i will gladly go rather than meet him again  i never see him now though we are under the same roof for he is wounded and i am wounded and neither of us can rise from our couches oh execrable monster sir george revel the murderer to strike his sword into the breast of a defenseless man assassin coward where was his heart when he meditated the blow where were his eyes when he directed it could not the radiancy of an angel dazzle him could not the express image of virtue overawe his impious rage the guardian spirit of innocence turned aside the point of his weapon it glanced upon the side of arundel and blood  such as angels shed  followed the stroke  i am ill again my brain whirls and i run into mere rhapsody i have done for the present my dear jane adieu love me spare me pity me forget my folly but remember my affection believe that whilst i am myself i am yours  farewell letter xxi lady louisa g to lady jane s soon after i had closed my last letter i was seized with a profuse bleeding at the nose it frightened these good people but it relieved me my head is better and my thoughts more collected  there is a negotiation in advance between mr arundel and that wretch my father is the mediator and the first article of the treaty conditions that i shall consent to receive proposals from sir george for you must know the monster is loving and will do justice if he is well bribed for it is it not an honest artifice to train him on in hope till he has made atonement for his murderous assault can any thing be a criminal deceit which saves the life of arundel for the monster is a duellist at all points and loves fighting so well that he will not wait till his antagonist is armed and is particularly resolute with his naked sword against a naked man till this matter is made up i will not stir when that is over  hide me ye caverns cover me ye alps montpelier as well as any other place any other place as well as montpelier  a message from arundel by my mother  he is shocked to hear i have had so violent a bleeding  yes arundel i have paid you blood for blood  your wound is healing mine rankles at my heart poor fellow he knows it not he little dreams how mere a murderer he is  he recommends a styptic with which it seems the surgeon stopped his bleeding  i begged my mother to thank him for his concern about me and assure him i had a more effectual styptic in resource it was an inconsiderate answer for my mother took the meaning instantly and burst into tears heaven preserve thee my child cried she may i never live to see thy death  and then thinking to raise my spirits she began to talk of sir george revel she flattered herself all things were now in a fair train to be accommodated mr arundel was penetrated with my situation and would strain every point with his uncle sir francis to acquiesce in the apology he had even promised if the worst ensued that he would never take a life in which my happiness was interested he would sooner sacrifice his own  mistaken generous man was this a styptic  yes it made my blood run back upon my heart  at that moment a sudden impulse seized me i forgot my resolution and would have given worlds to see him i thought my mother seemed to understand my wish or perhaps it was her own for she divides the day between us i enquired if he was recovering if he could rise from his couch without trouble if he could walk from one room to another i was then in my dressingchamber for i cannot endure the confinement of my bed i was sitting in my great chair opposite to a large glass that is placed between the windows i caught a glance of my pallid faded face my spirits sunk at the sight i could not bear that he should see me such a spectacle i suppressed the wish and said no more  my father is almost frantic with vexation at my illness he is indefatigable with sir george he has reported the affair to the king and received his majestys command to forbid their proceeding to any further extremities on pain of his displeasure i hope this will silence the old general sir francis and qualify his fiery spirit he is a most profound courtier and upon the best terms with my father he comes frequently to his nephew but i believe his visits do not promote his recovery at least my mother is of that opinion  alas my poor mother she is far from well my father bears too hard against her on account of this unhappy rupture with sir george i know he has given her very angry words though she is too considerate of me to confess it poor arundel is no less out of favor with him on the same score but as it is his interest to sooth him at this moment he affects to show him much attention  farewell my dear jane my spirits are lighter than they were a gleam of comfort comes over me and i feel a tranquillity which i have hitherto been a stranger to sleep steals upon me welcome sweet oblivion  letter xxii lady louisa g to lady jane s after two hours sleep in my chair i awoke with strength and spirits sensibly refreshed surely my guardian angel which had personated arundel in my dream had descended upon my heart with healing on his wings so strongly were the form and features of that beloved youth imprinted on my minds eye that when i awaked i looked about the room and hardly could persuade myself it was illusion his voice was yet left in my ear i listened all was silence i spoke to him i solicited a reply it was past reality of happiness is not for me oh charming vision how shall i recall thee  my mother crept softly into my room and was overjoyed to find the alteration in my countenance so much for the better she says my looks before i had the bleeding were so wild and delirious that they terrified her beyond measure she dont like to talk of arundel to me for she believes i am at bitter enmity with him on sir georges account yet she brought me good news of his recovery which she said was so far advanced thar he could walk about his chamber with tolerable ease that there was to be a meeting of the parties concerned for receiving sir george revels apology she hoped soon to congratulate me upon all differences being accommodated but this she believed would depend altogether upon mr arundels knowing what my wishes were in the case and therefore if i had no objection to a short interview with him she knew he would be very glad to say a few words to me before the parties met and in truth if i found my strength and spirits equal to the task she thought it might be a mutual benefit to both parties and prevent any further effusion of blood  oh my dear jane what a trepidation seized my heart at this moment the vision of arundel was about to be realized i took some time to recover myself and the better to divert my mothers attention from the agitation i was in pretended to adjust some little articles of my dress my face was not now so pale and languid as it was when i looked last in the glass and having settled a few other preliminaries which female vanity cannot dispense with i desired her ladyship to signify to mr arundel that i expected the favor of his visit  she accompanied him to my door but no further the moment was too much for me i was alone with arundel the beloved image i had seen in my dream whose words yet murmured in my ears whose tender caresses still impressed a melting softness on my soul was now in person before me and the shadow was converted into substance i sunk back in my chair he sprung to my assistance and gently taking my hand in his demanded if he should call lady g to me to this i replied  by no means pray sit down mr arundel and do not be alarmed for me i have been a good deal weakened by the loss of blood we are fellow sufferers in that particular but i am in all other respects much better than i have been i think myself greatly recovered within these few hours  i am overjoyed to hear it but if the honor you have now indulged me in is to cost you any sufferings by the exertion it occasions i shall never forgive myself for having made the request  i shall proceed to give you the substance of our dialogue and leave it with you to assign the parts to their respective performers  mr arundel i request you will consider your own situation and place yourself as much at your ease as if i was not present it is very flattering that you should wish to come to me as i am sure your motives cannot but be kind and friendly if one of us is to suffer by the exertion this occasions i am much afraid the misfortune will be yours for i suspect your good will to me may have brought you out of your chamber too soon for your safety  when i am in your service madam it is not possible for me to think of danger  what i wish to have now the honor of saying to you will i hope be understood by you as dictated by the sincerest respect if i seem guilty of any presumption in requesting this interview i beseech you to believe it can only spring from the interest i presume to take in your happiness i need not tell your ladyship that the inconvenience i suffer at present is the effect of an accident which took place in consequence of a certain misunderstanding that originated at spring grove accidents of this sort are so easily settled that there would not be the least occasion for the meeting which lord g has appointed here this day neither should i consent to be present at it if i were not given to understand that your ladyship has something more than general wishes for an amicable termination of all differences  i have indeed mr arundel very earnest very anxious ones  you will stop me if i proceed too far but i wish to make myself correctly understood without trespassing on your delicacy i must beg to be more particular  i have been told you are interested in the consequences that may ensue   heaven only knows how much  indeed that is strong  but i respect your sincerity i am then to conclude lady louisa from what you have been pleased to tell me that were i to pursue my resentment against sir george revel to the extremity which would naturally result from such transactions as have passed between him and me i should put a life to hazard that is dear and valuable to you  mr arundel i will not forfeit the sincerity you are pleased to commend in me i confess you would put a life to hazard was you to meet sir george revel in the field that is dear to me  it is enough madam i am satisfied  dear to me beyond expression valuable above all earthly considerations  i am fully satisfied all my resentments however just and natural are for ever buried in my bosom there they shall subside nor ever endanger the happy object you have honored with you love oh that he may prove worthy of his happiness  i now for the first time very sincerely rejoice that i was not armed when he attacked me that i had no sword in my hand to return that death upon him which he aimed at me  had you but seen his countenance whilst he spoke these words  where was his intelligence that he failed of applying to himself those equivocal answers i gave where was my resolution that i did not boldly turn upon him those awakening words  thou art the man generous arundel dull only to thine own merits blind only to a partiality in thine own favor which in no other case could have escaped thy notice  he made a pause and cast his eyes upon me with so penetrating a look that i apprehended he had made a very interesting discovery and was so thoroughly abashed that i could not utter a word in reply to the very generous speech he had made me he certainly perceived my embarassment though i had soon reason to know he had not interpreted it truly for he proceeded as follows   what honor i may leave behind me in this affair i cannot pretend to say but i shall have to reflect it is for your sake i am sacrificed and that reflection will heal every wound i can break off from the world without regret the short acquaintance i have made with it will not cost me many sighs to renounce and there are opportunities enough for my choice where i may have a chance at least of recovering my lost honor  good heavens mr arundel what can you mean what desperation is in your mind you alarm me  heaven forbid i should alarm you be assured lady louisa that whilst you are the protectress of sir george revel he is in the sanctuary of an altar that i cannot violate let him devote to gratitude the life you give him let him dedicate it to those pure and delicate attentions which may constitute your happiness if in any future time it should come to pass that to the injuries he has done to me he basely adds an injury to his benefactress in that moment my sword shall find him out and the vengeance now smothered burst with double justice on his head  oh jane i am undone in his opinion i suffered him to continue in his ignorance nay i had not power to undeceive him though i had been ever so willing for i was now in no condition to reply the tears started from my eyes i trembled with agitation i hid my face with my handkerchief and threw myself back in my chair  he rose from his seat uncertain what to do he came close to my chair as if to tender his assistance on a sudden he stopped short and turning from me said that he was afraid he had expressed himself very inconsiderately for which he begged my pardon  i assured him it was not so on the contrary i had heard nothing from him but what did honor to his sentiments perhaps added i you have mistaken me in some particulars but time will clear up all things to that i must refer you and by that i trust i shall be justified in your opinion  i hope he replied your ladyship does not suspect me capable of so much presumption as to form opinions for or against any resolutions you may think fit to adopt i should be of all men most impertinent were i to interest myself in any predilections of lady louisas further than to follow her choice with my good wishes wherever it may lead me but though i cannot prevent those wishes from springing in my mind i can and will prevent their escaping from my lips and i solemnly assure you that not a syllable of what has now passed shall ever transpire from me i am now going to receive sir george revels apology totally indifferent as to what it may be determined only to extricate your mind from its anxiety on his account  and can you not suppose that i am an enemy to duels upon general as well as particular motives is there any thing in nature so barbarous and savage so opposite to every principle of justice humanity and religion should i not be in some degree an accessory to the fatal consequences that may be expected to ensue if i failed to employ that influence for your preservation which i owe to your voluntary bounty when you kindly invest me with a power over your resentments by which i can prevent the effusion of human blood would it not be criminal in the extreme if i neglected to exert it assuredly it would and therefore mr arundel i repeat to you my most earnest entreaties to accept of the atonement which sir george revel is prepared to offer by doing which you will relieve me from unspeakable agonies and restore me to my health and spirits  is there any thing exclaimed he i would not do or suffer in such a cause from this moment sir george revel and i have no quarrel and that we never may in time to come it shall be my concern to provide against all chances of our ever meeting again so i do but hear that you are happy i cannot be an enemy to the man who makes you so  so saying he disappeared and left me to reflect upon the pious fraud i had been practicing my thoughts fluctuated alternately from pain to pleasure without observing any regular and determinate course i accused myself for suffering him to depart under an impression that must degrade me in his opinion but of this i soon acquitted myself by reflecting that but for this imposition there would have been no possibility of preventing the duel and i took credit for having now done as great a violence to my feelings for his safety as he had done to his honor for my repose  the day i hope is not far off when arundel shall know whose was the life so dear and valuable to me and for whose sake i suffered all these terrors  farewell letter xxiii countess of g to the hon mrs dormer your letter my dear friend alarmed me is my heart better known to you than to myself am i in this danger and not conscious of it am i in love with arundel  it is time indeed to recollect myself where am i on a precipice  and yet methinks if this were so your friendly voice would call me back not urge me forward as you now seem to do had i indeed descended into the vale of years where lifes passage becomes smooth and even and where no rocks nor precipices obstruct the traveller still some prudence would be necessary to avoid the traps and pits that folly digs even in that level path but if i have only turned the summit of the hill and am not yet landed at the bottom of it should not i who ascended with credit be cautious to descend without disgrace  surely then you treat me either with too much confidence or with too little care  your letter is a dangerous letter for a wife to read whose mind is actuated by resentment on one hand and by love on the other you have not only studied the french writers so closely but lived so long in their country that methinks you are become a kind of advocate for their matrimonial system and plead for the propensities of womans frail nature with as much ingenious sophistry and as little solid argument as the best of them  will you believe me when i tell you i did not see arundel for six hours after i had read your letter i passed that day in reviewing and examining the state of my heart and i began to flatter myself into a persuasion that you had decreed wrongfully against it i found a thousand natural excuses for the weakness i had given way to when i had my first interview with arundel after his wound i was then exhausted and afflicted by the reproaches of lord g louisas illness kept my spirits in continual alarm and the spectacle which arundel presented to my sight was peculiarly affecting in this manner i accounted with myself for the little command i had over my feelings at a certain crisis which i was firmly persuaded would not happen any more  elated with the issue of this selfexamination i took up your letter with an air of satisfaction and gave it a more attentive perusal than before when i had read it with timidity and a certain conscious reproach  it soothed my agitated spirits it lulled them into security and what is this fearcreated phantom said i within myself which i have raised up to alarm me why should i not indulge this pleasing partiality for a deserving object and though i may no longer call it a maternal affection yet i have the authority of a judicious friend and the testimony of a clear conscience for pronouncing it to be an innocent one  here i must break off as arundel has desired to see my daughter if her health permits before the parties meet for settling this affair with sir george revel louisa has had a long sleep and waked much refreshed by it she consents to see him i will continue my letter when their interview is over  arundel is now in conference with louisa to what purpose shall i any longer keep up a reserve and dissemble with my own heart why should i disguise from you the pleasure i received in the few moments i have now passed with arundel after the long intermission which my scruples had imposed upon me the very sight of him put all remonstrances to flight and silenced my inquietude nothing so gentle can be dangerous there was a temperate dignity in his looks that would have assured the most suspicious encouraged the most timorous he is the very soul of honor and if it is your pleasure to call my virtuous attachment by the name of love love let it be  so long as virtue is annexed to it and you approve what shall i fear i wait his return with impatience  in the mean time let me reveal to you the very inmost movements of my heart  you chided me for affecting to shelter myself under the privileges of age and at the same time reminded me of a certain date which i confess does not remove me far beyond the confines of youth i own to you i am flattered by your reproof and not very much out of humor with my lookingglass for deposing to the truth of your calculation neglected by my husband and cast off from his attentions i had ceased to consult it with any satisfaction but now since i have perceived new passions springing in my heart and have your privilege for indulging them i survey myself with conscious pleasure and am glad to discover that though mother to a fullgrown daughter i have not quite made over my whole stock of attractions but kept a residue to animate the cold respects of friendship and inspire the sensitive bosom of youth with those soft and interesting emotions which quicken all the springs of affection without disturbing the repose of virtue  like a reclaimed spendthrift i am now managing the remains of a diminished property with more economy and care than ever i bestowed upon the entire stock and i can perceive that beauty amongst many properties which have led us to compare it to a flower has this in common with all the deciduous tribe that though its principal display of vegetation is in the spring yet its energy is still reserved for what is called its midsummershoot  alas for me you can witness what a joyless spring mine was how little did he to whom my bloom was dedicated prize what he possessed and now from being careless he is become morose but let me not complain and you my friend you must not be too exact in showing me all my injuries the honor of a wife when depending on no other stay but that of duty is like a vessel riding at her single anchor which in a smooth sea may hold but if a storm assails her is but a precarious safeguard from its fury  arundel is now advancing fast in his recovery and my lord whose great ambition is to call an unprincipled assassin soninlaw labors hard for peace the vast possessions of sir george revel not forgetting the weight of his parliamentary interest are merits sufficient in his lordships balance to make his scale preponderate and my poor girl whose reason seems no less debilitated than her constitution by a round of pleasurable dissipation is as eager as her father to snatch the glittering bait insensible to the fatal the envenomed hook which is lurking under it in the mean time i who am a mere negative being without influence and without effort am fallen under my lords most unjust suspicion as being a medler in his measures and industrious to prejudice my daughters mind against the projected alliance with sir george truth is my witness that since the fatal affair at springgrove i have never once ventured upon the subject with louisa nor is it likely that i ever shall though i have more than once made these assertions to my lord i suspect they have gained no great belief for i am straightly watched and enquiries never fail to be made how often i have been with my daughter how long i staid with her and what passed between us so that i attend upon her no more than my duty naturally requires of me and on those occasions am extremely guarded how i betray the least dislike of her connection with sir george  thus discarded as i am from any interest or authority in the concerns of my own family under the displeasure of my husband and upon reserve with my daughter my sole resource is in the society of arundel with him i sit by his tender attentions i am reconciled to my situation and for the time forget how truly insignificant i am become to all the world but him he sees how totally i depend upon him and i cannot doubt but my eyes which dwell with such delight upon his countenance have told him to conviction how devotedly my heart adores him familiarized to each other he no longer treats me with that form and distance which rank exacts from our inferiors on a first acquaintance still he is the only man i ever met who knows how to be familiar with elegance tender with respect and perfectly at ease without one trace of unpoliteness good manners seem in him constitutionally inherent for they are never out of sight a single instant and through all the little services which my assiduity to assist him in his painful situation is for ever offering him not a touch a look a word beyond the limits of a modest though affectionate respect have i once experienced from him this gives me a security in his discretion and now that i have gained a confidence in myself from the encouraging explanation in your letter i have a privilege for indulging all those tender propensities which impel my heart toward the most amiable of mankind and make the moments that i pass with arundel so innocently charming with joy i have discovered his approaches advance step for step with mine he now takes my hand in his looks fondly in my eyes as they are either suffused with tears of pity for the pain he suffers or brightened by the smile of gratitude and love whilst he comforts me in my misfortunes and in the accents of an angel counsels me with the wisdom of one in these happy moments i have seen the rising color overspread his cheeks his breath fluttering and his eyes fixed ardently upon mine believe me my beloved friend there is no terror in those looks his bosom is the repository of honor his heart is tender but it is pure withal there is a dignity in his nature an inherent power within him that keeps those passions so rebellious in some breasts under perfect control in his it is then i truly venerate his character it is then i pay the tribute due to his exalted merit it is then i let him see without reserve how much i love and honor him  farewell letter xxiv countess of g to the hon mrs dormer i had scarce sealed my last letter when louisa sent to say she was alone and wished to see me mr arundel had just left her it was plain she had been in tears and her spirits seemed extremely fluttered she told me that the conversation had been very interesting he had promised her to accept of sir george revels apology so that tomorrow it is to be hoped will settle this untoward affair by the joy which she expressed on this account and the gratitude she seemed to bear to arundel for complying with her request i am afraid in is too clear that she is decidedly attached to sir george but as i am determined not to meddle in an affair which my lord takes so exclusively upon himself i was careful to avoid the subject and she did not incline to open herself to me of her own accord i was sorry to hear her say that this amiable young man is so much hurt by the proceeding and has put such a force upon his feelings by acquiescing in the proposed apology that he will quit our family and strike into another line of life though it is what i expected from his spirit i must do louisa the justice to confess that she appeared no less penetrated than myself by this intelligence and she was earnest with me to try all my influence for dissuading him from the measure she thinks he hinted at the army and as he is now upon terms with his uncle the general this is not unlikely if my lord does not withstand this by all means in his power or at least if he lets him go without some effectual mark of his favor i shall think it most ungenerous behavior  from her chamber i passed to arundels there i found him alone in a very melancholy state of mind it was evident something had passed of an unpleasant sort of which i made no enquiries but sat down close to the couch on which he had reposed himself he seemed exhausted and in pain i took his hand in mine and was beginning to count his pulse when he withdrew it gently from me and with a look of inexpressible softness said  why are you thus anxious about an insignificant being whom tomorrow you will be ashamed to acknowledge lady louisa is incurably attached to sir george revel and i am too considerate of her repose alarming as her situation seems to be not to sacrifice my resentment at her desire when i reflect that your feeling heart will be relieved by the same event that gives ease to hers how can i repent of my promise but indeed this task has been a hard one and unless i had felt for your responsibility in this affair all that man can feel for woman i could never have brought my spirit to submit to it  he turned his eyes upon me with a most touching expression there was a weariness and languor in his look that melted me to pity i could not answer him he put his hand to his side as if his wound seemed to pain him i thought his posture was uneasy and i desired he would suffer me to assist him in arranging it for this purpose i passed my arm under his neck to raise his head from the couch and whilst i was supporting it in this manner he turned his face toward me and my cheek dropped instinctively upon his what a tremor then ran to my heart he must have felt its tumult his own mean time apparently enjoyed no greater quiet for his breath fluttered and his whole frame was agitated he took his hand from his side and passing it round my waist strained me to him with a gentle pressure  whilst he held me thus in his embrace i said to him in a whisper  oh arundel let this virtuous endearment be the sacred seal of our friendship the love i bear you is as pure as your own unblemished honor reproach me not for my indiscretion if i now give way to the tenderness that overflows my heart but regard me as a grateful creature who owes every thing to your kindness and who would be miserable in the extreme if your pity did not cheer her  oh what must be the man cried he who is insensible to this excellence to these charms  as he uttered these concluding words he dropped his head upon my shoulder and pressing me more closely to him eagerly exclaimed  save me my dearest lady save yourself then extricating himself from the situation we were in he took both my hands in his and raising them devoutly to his lips  go cried he most amiable of women for the love of heaven be gone before i forfeit your esteem for ever  now what do you think of your proselyte had arundel been as well tutored in your precepts as i am what would now have been my situation o treacherous precepts to what perils have you exposed me  farewell letter xxv arundel to charles mortlake this silly duel is blown over and there remain no disputes to settle but what subsist between you and me i suppose we shall hardly adjust them at the swords point and yet i believe that is the only weapon at which i am any match for you  twas a ridiculous convention ours my lord spoke more suo with great dignity but i really cannot remember what he said and for the best reason in the world but i know a little dust thrown in the eyes of us poor mortals from the hand of majesty can do strange things aye and settle mighty feuds  hi motus animorum atque haec certamina tanta pulveris exigui jactu compressa quiescunt our good king god bless him is a good man and very considerate as his lordship gravely told us of his subjects lives and limbs but i cannot help thinking in all due deference that he will cruelly mispend his pains if he suffers himself thus to be drawn out as middle man in every hotheaded brawl that is started in his kingdom  a notable wise justice of peace whom i knew in our county used to compose squabbles between his neighbors by telling the parties at a word that if they could not settle their differences on the spot to betake themselves to the ring in his courtyard and fight it fairly out but if they were willing to agree let them go down to his cellar and shake hands over a tankard  something of this sort might pass at our cabinet for what i know a board of french marechals would probably have decided for the duel but it was thrown over without a dissenting voice in our council i dare say sir george uttered a very wellpenned apology and i make no doubt the author of it sat close at his elbow to prompt him to do him justice he had got it well by heart for he seemed to run it off pretty glibly but how it run and what it was i really cannot take upon myself to tell you as i am afraid i was then rather unpolitely engaged with a wondrous paragraph in the morning newspaper of an extraordinary genius for eating stones  thank my stars thought i here is one fellow found who has as strong a digestion as i have  as soon as the worthy baronet had closed his peroration i asked the two officers who were witnesses of the assault and now present on my part if they had attended to the words which the gentleman had been repeating they had strictly attended to them  were they such as they thought i might be satisfied with and yet retain their good opinion  they were such as would very honorably acquit me to the world  then added i there is no occasion to give the gentleman any further trouble  they asked me if i would insist upon the apology being printed  i replied that i had no ambition of being the subject or even the author of such a publication and therefore hoped it would not go to the press and now my lord made a kind of farewell speech to the court in which his majesty was again remembered with all due reverence and something very prettily brought in about the calumet of peace to our great edification the apologizing baronet made his bow i shook my friendly officers by the hand and so my dear charles there is an end of the matter  solvantur tabulae i might well have proceeded one word further in my quotation which would naturally apply to so ridiculous a consultation for healing a mans body with a few syllables but in truth my temper did not suit for laughter however well calculated the scene might be to provoke it  for you will observe i have not mentioned sir francis arundel as a party present read the following apology  dear nephew my heart is broke by the fatal event of this morning my beloved my only son has fallen a victim to honor and lost his life in a duel i conjure you therefore by all that is sacred to man follow not his steps but accept the atonement which will be offered you this morning let me not be bereft of you both you are now my last hope my heir alas and must i add my only son  fra arundel   here is a melancholy case in point for your argument against duelling i never saw my cousin but once in my life he was a fine personable young man but had an air of uncommon ferocity and haughtiness and seemed very ambitious of being employed in my affair but by no means in a pacific capacity i whispered one of the officers and found he was informed of the event he said the deceased was clearly in the fault and that it was a very frivolous affair about a common woman i find myself able to be carried to my uncles house which is not far off and shall prepare myself to make my condolances  as there is no doubt but this compromise of ours will soon bring about a marriage between lady louisa and sir george this house will no longer be an agreeable residence for me nor can i think of keeping up any connection with the fatherinlaw of such an assassin for to say the truth my dear charles  haeret lateri lethalis arundo  letter xxvi arundel to charles mortlake i have been carried to my uncles house and bore the motion of the chair much better than i expected  poor man this misfortune has broke him down i never saw a greater spectacle of se  is it an observation founded in truth that these high spirits sink under their sorrows more than men of ordinary passions i am apt to think most extremes in nature are nearer to each other than we are aware of at least they seem to hold a very good correspondence together though they reside at a distance  our meeting was very distressful he threw his arms round my neck and gave vent to the vehemence of his grief strong gusts of tears and heavy sighs by turns broke from him and at intervals his face seemed to suffer a kind of convulsive twitching that looked very alarming  he eagerly demanded if my affair was compromised and when i assured him it was he cried out  i thank god for it two victims to that cursed practice of duelling would be too many for one morning and for one sad heart to survive you see me here nephew a miserable man at the end of life bereft of my only child who has sacrificed himself to a fashion to a freak to the start of a moment he is taken from me in the prime of his days unprepared for death in the heat of passion upon a foolish quarrel for a worthless trollop what will become of me if you do not support me in my affliction and fill up the place of a son  you will naturally suppose i said every thing on this melancholy occasion which my heart could suggest for his satisfaction and relief  yes nephew continued he you must be now my francis arundel my son my sole support be kind to me be an honor to the name you bear and take example by the fate of your unhappy cousin i feel some awkward symptoms which convince me there is no time to be lost in making myself ready for my call i have sent for my lawyer and shall not sleep till i have put the last hand and seal to my will you are the only arundel of the generation under me now remaining of our branch you are therefore my natural heir and as such i shall instantly adopt you your uncle john who is now at sea has ever been a kind and loving brother to me he is a noble gallant fellow and an honor to his profession but at his time of life there can be no likelihood of his marrying therefore i shall charge your estate with such an annuity to him as in his plain way of living will supply all the comforts he can wish to enjoy of your father you must forgive me if i do not speak  i am sorry for the cause i replied and i wish it was in my power to be a mediator but i trust that time and milder sentiments on both sides will effect that reconciliation which i have not the present presumption to undertake i hope notwithstanding that you will allow me to inform my father in general terms of all which this fatal morning has produced so far at least as it affects me  do as you like cried he do as you like in that particular but do not talk to me about it i will have no concern or correspondence with him as for myself i cannot expect to last long and probably shall give you the slip upon very short notice therefore my dear boy as we have been too long estranged from each other let me hope we shall not be separated for the remainder of my days and as your fortune now places you far above dependence i suppose you will not hesitate at detaching yourself from your present situation with lord g  to this i strove to make a suitable and becoming reply acknowledging my obligations for the bounty he intended to bestow on me in grateful terms without running into any fulsome protestations i said i was both ready and desirous of attaching myself entirely to his person and service from henceforth and i hoped the period of our acquaintance to come would be much longer than he seemed to expect with respect to lord g i had such strong reasons to wish myself out of his family that i should obey his commands with the greatest pleasure and would seize the first opportunity for taking leave of his lordship and all further connections with him  i see no necessity for that said my uncle for though you will find yourself in affluence you may avail yourself of lord gs introduction for becoming a man of business by which you may be an active and useful member of the community and this leads me to remind you that by the fatal event of this morning there is a vacancy in my borough and as i believe you are just of age to take you seat i propose with your good liking to bring you into parliament  i will not take up your attention i replied at this time by giving you all my motives for wishing to detach myself from the politics and connections of lord g i flatter myself they are such as you will not condemn me for and in the same spirit of independence you will allow me to declare before you take any step for bringing me into parliament that i should hold myself as a traitor to my country and a disgrace to your name if i could consent to enter upon that trust but as a free and unbiassed member not wedded to any party or opinion no follower of lord g nay permit me to add and be not offended at my plainness not even of you my benefactor  a gleam of joy sparkled in his eyes as i said this he rose from his seat took me cordially by the hand and immediately cried out  that is right my good boy i see you are a true arundel henceforth you are my son  the gleam was momentary his features fell convulsion shook his face  ah me he cried and sunk again into his chair covering his cheeks with both hands as if to stop their motion or at least conceal it from my notice  it was a piteous sight and affected me extremely i thought it was best not to take notice to him of the disorder he was too visibly in and therefore to divert his attention i began to tell him of the match lord g was making for his daughter with sir george revel at the same time observing to him that it was impossible for me to be cordial with the fatherinlaw of a wretch who in the most dishonorable manner had attempted my life for though it was true i had made peace with him i was determined never to make acquaintance either with him or his connections  well well said my uncle take your own measures and be your own master in all respects it was so i treated my poor unfortunate son and so i shall treat you i desire you will command in this house for i shall no more concern myself with the affairs of this world when i have once completed the deed that is to put you in possession it is fit that i who am hastening out of life should retire from trouble if you are determined to have no further connection with lord g i do not wish to enquire into your reasons so long as you adopt them i am disposed to think them just  here his servant came to announce the lawyers arrival upon which he desired me to return to lord g and communicate to him as much as i thought fit of my affairs and as soon as my health permitted to take possession of his house where he should give orders for my reception consult your surgeon however added he and do nothing rashly to endanger your health  here we parted and thus have i given you the particulars of a sudden and extraordinary revolution in my fortune which changes the whole system of my life and opens a new prospect flattering indeed to my ambition but awful to a mind which foresees the trials it has to undergo and trembles for the responsibility which must accompany such unmerited good fortune  farewell letter xxvii arundel to the rev dr arundel i have the painful task of informing you that sir francis arundel had this morning the melancholy account of his sons being killed in a duel i have visited him in consequence of his misfortune and am sorry to add that the violence of his grief seems to threaten him with very alarming symptoms i submit to you whether it may not be advisable to make a journey to town upon this occasion i will flatter myself that grief will not lose its property in his instance nor fail to soften the asperity of his mind toward a brother whose nature i am assured is thoroughly disposed to peace and reconciliation no efforts on my part shall be omitted to prepare my uncles heart with those healing impressions which may dispose it for the happy return of brotherly love and affection  sir francis has been pleased to signify his intention of making me his heir and proposes my immediate succession to the vacancy in his borough which the unhappy event of this day has occasioned these favors have been accompanied with a request that i will live with him in future which will of course incapacitate me from any longer attendance upon lord g these commands i am now preparing to obey and shall very soon take leave of my present situation  i have been some time confined by an accidental hurt upon one of my ribs but am so well recovered of it that i expect in a few days to be out again i hope you continue to enjoy your health that you long may is the sincere prayer of  your most dutiful son and devoted servant  letter xxviii dr arundel to francis arundel what may be those properties of grief which you are so well acquainted with i am not studious to learn nor overeager to experience if you mean me to believe that grief will melt the marble of your uncles heart they must be miraculous properties indeed and a great deal more than i shall put my trust in as for a journey to london upon the mere expectation of seeing this mighty miracle performed upon your uncle you must excuse me if i do not hold it quire so advisable as you seem to think it nor is it altogether so easy and perfunctory a matter for me to undertake at my time of life persuaded moreover as i am that miracles have ceased  i am obliged to you for the offer of your interest with sir francis in the way of reconcilement but are you sure i seek that reconcilement are you so well satisfied with your own great powers of persuasion that you can by the charms of your rhetoric convert the hard rock into the springing well is there no delicacy previously to be observed toward my honor which perhaps may not willingly condescend to owe that reconcilement to the influence of a third person which my own merits could not command you may inherit your uncles property mr arundel but i envy you it not if you take his pride into the bargain and with it any portion of that insensibility toward my feelings which with his other possessions seems in this instance to have devolved upon you  though you may in time be found the heir of his estate remember at the same moment i if living am the heir of his title where is the provision to support it am i to crouch to you like the descendants of the aged eli to the child samuel for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread and shall i say like them put me i pray thee into one of the priests offices that i may eat a piece of bread no sir i am a priest already and have just enough to purchase that poor diet without your help and sir joseph arundel if ever that shall be my title shall still toil on in the humble office of a parish priest nor crouch for a single morsel of those rich endowments which have passed over his hoary hairs to fall upon the giddy head of youth  but i must revoke that word when you take your seat amongst the senators and elders of the state happy nation to be so wisely governed and thrice happy constituents who are to consign their interests to so grave so competent so experienced a representative  you are pleased to tell me that your uncle has desired you to live with him and abandon the situation in which my interest placed you with a noble and powerful patron and you have obeyed his commands obeyed them without reference to me joined with my worst enemy deserted my best friend and this by the commands of your uncle if my commands go for nothing might you not have paid some little attention to my wishes might you not have stopped to hear them to enquire of them to know at least what it is your father wishes and then it would have been time enough to obey what your uncle commands  you say you have been confined by an accidental hurt upon one of your ribs my information is that you have been fighting a duel you can best tell which is the truth you may have had your uncles commands for this also he has been a man of war from his youth and dearly he abides the passion he has always had for blood the judgment has fallen upon his own house he that smiles with the sword shall perish by the sword in this as in the relinquishment of your patron you have not waited even for my wishes for it is not likely that i should recommend a practice which though stamped with the specious name of honor violates the laws of god as well as man if then i am founded in my fact and this hurt on your ribs which you lightly term accidental is in truth a wound you have received from the sword of a duellist i can only remark that you have taken a very convenient way of throwing your faults upon chance which being but a slender carrier will i am afraid in time be so much overloaded by you as to fall under his burden  letter xxix lady louisa g to lady jane s i have now the happiness to inform my dear jane that this horrible suspense is over and mr arundel has accepted sir george revels apology but think not that my fears are over my sorrows at rest no they are of the hydra generation and seem even to multiply by amputation in the first place my impatient father has opened upon me already and in this style he has discoursed   well louisa i have at last brought this young man of ours to reason our friend sir george revel has condescended to make him a very handsome apology and he with a great deal of very haughty indifference has condescended to accept of it i believe in my conscience the fellows head is turned by the situation i have raised him to but i shall take his pride down a peg or two before long  i have never been able to discover any pride in mr arundel  pooh what signifies whether you have discovered it or not i tell you these academics when they have stuffed a little greek and latin under their caps are as vain as peacocks but i shall pluck some of his fine feathers i can tell him it will be some years before i shall stand in need of the fathers services again and it will not be much sooner that the son will ever be the better for mine  that must be as your lordship pleases but suppose we choose some subject more agreeable to talk upon  well recollected my dear and what subject can be more agreeable than the affair we have in view respecting sir george revel you see what a fine gallant fellow he is elegant in his figure manners and address quite a man of the world a finished gentleman traveled speaks the languages dresses well entertains well dances well gives the fashion splendid in his equipage worshipped by all the fine women about town and incontestably the first match in point of fortune now in the kingdom  i am told indeed he is very rich  rich child there is no end to his property in land and money then his boroughs  i verily believe he has interest if well managed to command eight votes in parliament at the lowest computation sir george revels political weight is exclusive of all other considerations a very great thing hitherto it has been thrown into the opposing scale and if he and his members had not very handsomely seceded from the division of yesterday we of the ministry should have lost the question so nearly were we balanced these louisa are only the first fruits of his attachment the prospect of an alliance with my family has already made him neutral there only wants another step to convert him into a friend you see my dear how the father is indebted to the daughters charms and therefore taking all these considerations into my view i find so many things conspire to recommend him to my good liking that high as i hold your pretensions i not only give you my consent to pursue your inclinations by marrying sir george revel but must fairly confess it is become the warmest wish of my heart that you should do so  being ill prepared on the sudden to evade this pointed attack i very imprudently answered that i believed my mother did not think so favorably of sir george revel as his lordship did  your mother think cried he starting up in a rage  your mother think not so favorably of sir george what right has she to think at all about him do you suppose your mothers opinions are to weigh with me who is your mother that she should think for me and who am i did i raise the daughter of a plain country gentleman to the rank of a countess to fill her head with notions that she is to direct the interests the alliances of my family i shall soon teach her a better understanding of her duty and i desire you will not pay the least regard to what she thinks in disfavor of sir george revel when i peremptorily and definitively declare for him  i was now so much alarmed for the mischief i had done and for the storm of passion and reproach which i had unadvisedly drawn down upon my poor suffering mother that i was debating with myself in what words to declare to him my own fixed and determined aversion from the match he proposed but his looks were so furious that they frightened me from my purpose and i did not venture upon any thing more than to beseech him in the most earnest manner not to let my mother suffer his displeasure for what i had said i solemnly assured him she had never spoke a word in sir georges dispraise since his lordships anger about the affair at spring grove on the contrary i protested and i with truth that she had always held a language entirely conformable to his lordships wishes ever since she had known what those wishes were and that it would make me the most miserable of beings to bring trouble and reproach upon her only because i supposed that she possibly might not have altered her opinion of the man though she had changed her way of speaking of him  he had scarce patience to hear me thus far when he cut me short and in a tone very little softened by all i had been saying thus resumed his invectives  i know what your mother has done full well and i know what she is now doing caballing with that arundel against me and sir george revel i should not have been at all surprised if she had gone the length of pressing him into the duel had not the chastisement he has already met with cooled his courage was ever such an affront offered to a man of sir georges sort was ever such an insolent message sent by such an insosolent messenger thank my stars he has smarted for it he has been pretty well punished and had not he stopped where he did he would have been completely provided for but sir georges life was of too much consequence to be pitted against a beggar i will keep no such fellow in my family warm no such snake in my bosom though he is a wounded one he is venomous and i will dispatch him let us send this instant for your mother and her accomplice into the room and you shall hear me give him his dismission before her face  he was actually going in his rage to ring the bell when i just summoned strength of voice enough to cry out  for heavens sake my lord stop your hand my spirits are so exhausted that if you proceed any further i shall faint he paused looked at me saw the situation i was in and in great haste called my servant my mother herself was in a moment at the door and ran to my assistance my father walked out of the room i had just time before my servant came to me to say in a low voice to lady g alas madam i have undesignedly set my father in a rage against you my heart bleeds for you oh that i might die and be no longer the unhappy cause of all your sufferings  my dear dear child said she be under no pain about me your fathers rage has no longer any terrors i shall meet it with perfect composure  i scarce know what followed after some time she left me to the care of my woman and went out of the room in tears  strengthen my brain kind heaven it is very weak it shakes it wanders support it i implore thee in that moment when to the face of my enraged father i shall resolutely denounce scorn and rejection to that wretch sir george and vindicate an unoffending injured mother  farewell letter xxx the hon mrs dormer to the countess of g you are not half so angry with me as i am with myself for writing you so inconsiderate a letter the subject seized me in an unfortunate moment you know the warmth of my resentments and can make some allowances for an imagination at all times perhaps too volatile but when heated by such indignities as your unfeeling lord had cast upon the favorite of my heart not likely to be restrained within the bounds of prudence  i am a foolish old woman who am apt to speak what i think and write as i feel i am therefore always employed with my friends and correspondents either in committing errors or atoning for them your conduct has been so uniform that i have fallen into fewer scrapes of this sort with you than any body else you are not familiar with my absurdities and therefore it was that this appeared so great to you some of my more experienced intimates would only have said  this is so like dormer  and thought no more of it  you must know in the first place i am in love with arundel myself  in the next place i am furious against lord g  but no more of this folly i am relapsing into it again  now if i had ever learnt the art to blot i would strike out this nonsensical paragraph but i go beyond ben jonson in my love of shakespeare for i do not stop on this side of idolatry i idolize even his errors and like alexanders wrynecked courtiers copy the inaccuracy because i cannot reach the sublimity of his genius  do you think i have lived single all my days only because i could not find a husband no my dear lady in good queen besss golden days or something later perhaps i made some noise in the world and had offers in plenty some tolerable some intolerable but as arundel was not then born and i could find no man entirely to my mind i knew my temper too well to trust it to any one mans keeping for life when it could hardly hold out for a day there were two things my spirit was never proof against it could resist neither kindness nor unkindness therefore i argued with myself thus  as it is the nature of those insidious animals called lovers to be most alluringly kind and as it has sometimes happened that those tiresome creatures called husbands will be most provokingly unkind i shall infallibly pass myself over from one to the other and probably forget to carry my reputation with me for this reason i thought it best to have nothing to say to either one or the other and thus it has come to pass that with some hard struggles and now and then a hairbreadth escape with a great deal of reasoning and a good deal of repugnance here i am at your command as veritable an old maid as most are at seventy years end how much longer i shall hold out in this humor i will not pretend to say for i am coming up to london in all my charms and if my spectacles should have the property of archimedess glasses and set the tender heart of arundel on fire it is all over with me i shall be found in the likeness of hogarths old bride at the altar i may as well step into the frame at once and take my post in the printshops for every body will know me  and now to be serious  the conclusion of your interview with arundel threw me into a trembling much as i love tender scenes i do not wish my real friends to be the performers of them it is too like vaulting on the rope a pastime i was never fond of a false step breaks the vaulters neck thank the fates you are fairly on your feet again we old gossips in whom the heyday of the blood is over do as much mischief with our prattle as trumpeters in a battle by their clamor when they set folks a fighting and themselves keep clear of the fray  i shall be heartily glad to hear that arundel is well of his wound and that wicked couch out of his chamber it will not then be incumbent upon you to nurse him any longer there is not a more ticklish office in nature than to be settling and arranging a young mans posture on these charitable occasions and adjusting his head upon a pillow when he cannot do it for himself i would as soon handle a wounded wasp they seem dying but they have strength to sting  i remember to have been in the same predicament with a lover of my own near a century ago the poor man had been in the hundreds of essex where he had caught the malady du pays and was chattering and shivering in as complete an aguefit as ever came out of the fens my foolish pity persuaded me to visit him i thought i could not have done it at a less dangerous moment he was as unpromising and harmless a lover as you ever beheld for my part i thought him dying and began to be so full of commiseration and kindness that i charmed away his ague so effectually that i was very near conjuring up a worse enemy in its place in short my dear lady i learnt enough by the danger i escaped never to go a nursing sick lovers any more  farewell letter xxxi the countess of g to the hon mrs dormer it is impossible to be angry with you long because you will not let me be serious yet serious i must strive to be for i have a melancholy matter to relate  my lord and i are upon the point of separation i have had an interview with him of which i must give you the particulars as it is probably the last i shall have to relate you will be more ready to excuse the length and dullness of the relation  my dear louisa had rather unadvisedly let fall a hint to his lordship that i was not of the same way of thinking with himself in regard to sir george revel this made him furious and all she could say to allay his anger and convince him that i had not practiced upon her mind was to no purpose  in this temper i found him alone in his dressing room when he instantly welcomed me with the ensuing salutation   by what right madam do you presume to oppose my authority in this family how is it that you take upon yourself knowing as you do that sir george revel has my approbation and full consent to marry my daughter how is it i say that you take upon yourself to hinder and obstruct that match by seizing every secret underhand opportunity of decrying that gentlemans character and person in her hearing i would have you know madam that these insidious practices against me shall no longer be put up with i will not sacrifice my daughters interest and happiness to your whim and caprice nor because a paltry collegeboy whom i have too goodnaturedly received as a dependant into my house and family has been instigated to affront a man of fortune and fashion and been properly chastised for it will i suffer him to carry on a cabal under my very roof and effect that revenge by secret means which he wanted spirit to pursue in a more open manner  here his passion coming to a stop i calmly answered   if your lordship is now at leisure to hear my answer i will make it but if you have any more charges against me i will wait your time and then reply to the whole  i could perceive the firm and deliberate manner in which i addressed him was what he did not expect he pretended however to pass it off with a contemptuous sneer and told me i might do as i liked whether i answered him or answered him not was of very little consequence he had made up his mind  if your lordship has made up your mind against conviction i replied there is indeed but little use in my speaking at all but if there are such things as truth and honor in existence i call them to witness that i have never once opposed your wishes for an alliance with sir george revel since the affair at your villa for which i underwent your displeasure so severely i repeat to you my lord in the most solemn manner that i have never insinuated to louisa even in the most distant degree any thing to that gentlemans disadvantage  then pray madam what is your opinion of that gentleman i desire to know your real sentiments of sir george revel  no my lord there you must excuse me i have strictly done my duty in not opposing the person you approve of but so long as my thoughts do not offend against your commands i conceive i have a right to keep them within my own breast and it must be something more than inquisitorial torture that shall force them from me  upon my word you are grown very lofty on a sudden but as i know your thoughts full well there needs no inquisition to extort them from you yes madam i know your thoughts and i know your counsels i know your enmity against sir george and i know the fomenter of that enmity a dependant i can easily dismiss out of my sight but i would have you also to know lady g that i will not suffer even a wife to remain under this roof who is secretly plotting with an upstart creature of her own training to poison the affections and counteract the welfare of my daughter in the most essential concern of her life  my lord g when you are pleased to dismiss me from this roof you will add very little aggravation to the cruelty i have too often experienced under it  then leave it today tomorrow the next day  as soon as you please  where is it your pleasure that i should go  i care not any where but to spring grove and for mr arundel your confidante i desire you will be present whilst i give him his dismission  having so said he rung the bell and a servant attending bade him tell mr arundel if he was able to leave his chamber he desired to see him immediately as soon as the servant was gone he said to me i desire lady g you will not leave the room i made no reply and a silence ensued till mr arundel entered leaning on the servants arm  there is something awful in the human countenance where courage and integrity reside but when these virtues are set off with manly beauty such as arundel displayed upon his entrance the swelling heart of pride will shrink before it and the tyrant feel himself a coward  it was evidently so with my insulting lord whose storm so loud before a woman lowered itself into a small still voice which opened with an apology for bringing him out of his chamber when the motion seemed so painful to him  my lord replied arundel i must be much worse before i should excuse myself from obeying your commands  his lordship was hampered and i dare say heartily repented of his undertaking but his dread of betraying himself in my presence pushed him on the stage and he began very lamely to open the scene as follows   mr arundel i have a negotiation now going on in my family in which sir george revel is a party very intimately concerned and though peace is now established between you yet considering all that has passed i think your longer residence in this family can neither be agreeable to yourself nor altogether convenient to sir george or me  your lordship judges with great delicacy of my feelings as far as your motives for wishing my departure arise from your consideration for me only but my lord from the urgency of your message and these commands following so close upon my acquiescence in sir georges apology i should presume you have other motives more pressing than my convenience which now induce you to lay those commands upon me  i told you so sir i gave you other reasons i said it would not be agreeable nor convenient to sir george  i dare say it would not my lord but give me leave to ask if there was not another person named for whose approbation i have much more deference than for sir georges  yes i do not deny it i did say and i say it again that it will not be suitable or agreeable to me  i humbly thank your lordship for this early proof of your sincerity but i must also appeal to your justice and as it is known to my friends that i have had the honor of being admitted into your lordships family i beg to know whether i have your leave and commission to tell them that i go out of it with equal honor  i shall not commit my reasons to your report sir i shall give them myself to your father and your uncle sir francis which are all the friends of yours that i am acquainted with as for you i have only to recommend it to you to return back to your studies at cambridge and pursue a line of life that you are more fit for it is not for a dependant to enter into cabals against his patrons connections and interfere in the concerns of the noble family he is allowed to live in the prudence and circumspection necessary for such a station your books it seems have not instructed you in and nothing but experience of the world can teach the situation i had intended to place you in is a post of confidence and private trust it is through your own fault that these kind intentions do not take place and it would be only leading you into disappointments if i were to let you build any hopes of favor or promotion from me  i watched the countenance of arundel whilst this was passing and saw his eyes sparkle with fire at some expressions that touched him and need not be pointed out to your notice the struggle he had within himself to repress his immediate resentment was apparent but after a short pause when my lord had done speaking he made him this reply  my lord i relinquish all hopes of favor or promotion from you without suffering the least disappointment and should cheerfully quit a situation which is now become incompatible with my present views in life if it was not accompanied with a charge against my character of a very serious nature and which i am very sure i do not deserve from your lordship you accuse me of entering into cabals against your connections and interfering in the concerns of your family what connections of yours have i caballed against what family concerns have i interfered in i am entitled to my defense my lord and therefore i desire you will state my guilt  the connection i allude to sir is that which i have in contemplation to enter into with sir george revel that as i take it is a very serious concern and i have too good grounds for belief not to be warranted in saying that you have been very hostile to sir george nay that you are so still and have taken every means in your power jointly with the lady present to raise prejudices against him in that bosom where least of all they ought to take place  i shall answer very plainly to every part of your lordships charge and first that i have been hostile to sir george revel it is something extraordinary when your lordship sees me here before you carrying the marks of that mans brutal attack upon me at a time i had no arms to defend myself with that you accuse me of hostility especially when i have refrained from taking either personal or legal vengeance for the injury my lord when i called upon sir george revel to explain some very insolent expressions he had treated me with under the protection of your roof i went to him in a peaceable manner in my riding dress as i had dismounted from my horse without any weapon whatever and this i did from delicacy to his situation knowing he was then upon guard and for the very purpose that he might not be tempted to a violation of his duty or myself exposed to the imputation of provoking an officer under those restrictions by the hostility of my appearance had i gone armed to the meeting was this a symptom of enmity or is this wound which still disables me the proof on which your lordship grounds your charge is the issue of this mornings meeting at which you yourself condescended to be present any mark of a resentful hostile spirit in me a man indeed may pardon through fear what his heart would prompt him to resent but as i will not suppose your lordship means to impute my acquiescence in sir georges apology to cowardice i do not see how you can with any justice derive an act of forgiveness from a spirit of enmity  the second part of your charge is that i am still hostile to this gentleman my lord if i am to regard sir george revel as one whom you are disposed to honor by your alliance i shall not so far forget the respect due to your lordship as to say any thing more in your presence than simply to assure you that without bearing any hostility to him i have no desire of any acquaintance with him  the last and most serious part of your lordships charge against me is that i have endeavored to sow prejudices in that bosom which i join with you in thinking ought to be kept sacred and which i do from my heart both hope and believe is truly sacred not only from the taint you allude to but from all others of whatever description no my lord this charge i deny in the most peremptory manner and whoever dared to abuse your ear with the base insinuation is as false as hell itself can make a human creature i have not that meddling nature in me neither have i presumption to arrogate to myself any influence over the lady i am accused of having tampered with once and only once i have had the honor of seeing her since i received my wound and those few minutes she will bear me witness were otherwise employed than in prejudicing her mind against sir george revel it was because i would not point my sword against the man on whom her future happiness may probably depend that in those few minutes i gave up a resentment which with shame i confess it years would not else have extinguished i can only say i could have wished you to hear this from lady louisa rather than from me but the injustice of your accusation must be the apology for my vanity  i must trespass on your lordships patience with one word or two more there is a lady present whom you have thought fit to associate with me in this part of your charge i should suppose my lord when you honor me with such an associate you cannot mean to couple guilt with purity that would be a most unnatural league indeed a guilty man with the most perfect of her sex an incendiary in your family with her who is the blessing of it here then my lord i offer no defense for joined with lady g i can commit no crime nor does your lordship when you bring her virtues into the same association mean to impute any to me i receive it as an acquittal of the whole as the highest honor you can confer upon me and am infinitely bound to you for it  you are very ingenious truly sir and have given me a sufficient specimen of the logic of your schools but i have heard enough of it and do not wish you to put your imagination to any further efforts i shall write to your father and as your uncle is my very good friend i mean to call upon him very shortly at present you will excuse me as i have rather more important business on my hands than to listen to your rhapsodies  mr arundel upon this rose from his seat and without a word more left the room oh what an expressive contrast is that countenance capable of the look he fixed upon my lord what a look it was whilst my heart thrilled as he turned his eyes on me such pity such benevolence beamed forth i never shall forget it whilst my senses last they will never lose that impression i became insensible to lord gs cruelty in short my friend i thoroughly despised him and seeing him stand confounded swelling with rage and shame irresolute abashed and not knowing what next to do i was willing to retire from so mortifying a sight and humbly demanded if he had any further commands for me  nothing to trouble me with  had he resolved upon the place of my destination stay madam cried he and at that instant a servant delivered him a letter he opened it and as he read it his color changed he seemed perplexed and after a considerable time he said did you know of this madam was you informed of this event in sir francis arundels family the letter is from him  i assured him i knew of no event in sir franciss family i had had no manner of conversation with mr arundel that day  it is strange said he your friend should not impart to you such good news such a revolution in his fortune sir francis writes me word he has lost his only son in a duel that he has adopted his nephew who has just left us and in very civil terms requests of me to release him for a time at least as he means to bring him into parliament upon the vacancy in his borough this is a very unexpected event i wish i had known it a little sooner sir francis has always been my very good friend but i always understood he was at enmity with that branch of his family which mr arundel belongs to and had no conception this young man was in his good graces  oh my dear friend what was then my transport my exultation  equalled by nothing unless by my lord gs remorse and vexation  i am astonished arundel did not mention this to me continued my lord talking to himself because he would not deign to address himself to me though it was plain he wished to be answered i cannot think why he would conceal a thing of this sort it would have altered the case very widely i should have held a very different language to him sir francis is the last man in england i would wish to offend his support is very necessary to us at this pinch i have pledged myself for him and his other member to the cabinet ten to one but this angry young man will turn the tables upon me perhaps he will be a speaker by the sample he has given me i should expect it  he was now thoroughly weary of his soliloquy and therefore concluded by demanding of me if i did not think mr arundel had talents to make an orator  so strange a question showed the incoherence of his thoughts and i really knew not how to help him out by any answer i could give i therefore simply observed that i was no judge of mr arundels talents but i had the highest opinion of his principles and made no doubt he would do himself credit in any station of life  my lord now applied himself to the bell and bade the servant who attended go up to mr arundels room and say that he would call upon him the answer was that mr arundel had left the house and was just gone out in a chair  this was a fresh blow to my lord and i think i have seldom seen him so disconcerted i now made a second effort to go but he again stopped me for even my company was now i suppose some relief to his own at least i served him as a butt to vent his illhumour upon and divert it in some degree from himself  and pray madam says he how does your ladyship account for this young mans not informing me of his cousins death and the great fortune that so unexpectedly devolves upon him for sir francis let me tell you is extremely wealthy  i suppose my lord replied i as this event was no part of his defense he did not think it necessary to state it  in my opinion now it would have been the very best part of his defense  perhaps he was in hopes his integrity would have been sufficient for that purpose and did not choose to be indebted for his exculpation to interest when he had innocence to plead and the merit of a sacrifice to the repose of your lordships family which i have no doubt cost him dear to make in that light i regard his silence as one amongst many instances of the great delicacy of his way of thinking  your ladyship owes him a good turn and i perceive you are resolved to be as stout an advocate for him as he is for you  here our conversation broke off abruptly enough his lordship set out for his office and i went up to my daughter  farewell letter xxxii lady louisa g to lady jane s one of those unexpected events which seems as if it was the fabricated incident of a novel has just happened and mr arundel is of a sudden become heir to sir francis arundels great estate by the melancholy catastrophe of a duel in which his cousin a very fine young man was shot through the lungs and died upon the ground  oh my jane what agonies have i escaped by the peaceable conclusion of this terrifying affair with sir george revel to you alone is the secret revealed for whose sake those agonies were endured had then my eyes no language in them when arundel in the benevolence of his heart made a sacrifice of his reluctant spirit to the preservation of my health and peace alas alas is it not too plain he does not think of me had he been a lover he could not have wanted intuition to spy out the secret workings of my soul and it now wounds me to the quick when i reflect upon this proof of his indifference nor is this all proof rises upon proof for had his heart but felt the slightest touch of love he never would have put his resentment aside to clear the passage for a rival no where love is in the case jealousy will inflame even a coward against his competitor and arundels courage wants nothing to animate it  oh jane how these reflections humble me how false and foolish is the worlds flattery what avails it me that i have been the butt and gazingstock of all the staring vacant eyes in every public place perhaps there is some catching quaint caprice about my form some garish shewy ornament that nature has embroidered on it which silly coxcombs are trapped with but which men of taste turn away from with disgust i can never be brought to think i have any attractions but such as i ought to blush for when i could draw to me only such a wretch as sir george revel and repel arundel it is plain that virtue flies me while vice for its own loathsome ends pursues i must renounce either myself or arundel i must believe i am unworthy of his pure regards or hold him for insensible and blind he thinks no doubt that he made a mighty sacrifice for my sake when he put by resentment alas how much more have i done for him when to preserve his life from risque i suffered him to think that i was so depraved in heart as to endure the addresses of sir george whose loss then is greatest his in being robbed of his revenge or mine who am ruined in his good opinion i have deceived him into my own destruction  what is now to be done you will say perhaps a second conference may set it right  a second conference is now no longer in my reach he is gone for ever an angry separation has taken place between my father and him he has left the house never to return to it again adopted by his uncle he now lives with him and holds no further correspondence in this hostile quarter shall i write to him no if there is such a thing on earth as commendable pride if there is such an obligation existing as duty to a parent i am now responsible to those demands in those fetters i am chained and i would rather die than beg and be despised  there was a moment when i thought he felt some little influence at his heart from this unworthy form twas our first interview my father brought him down to us at springgrove he presented him to my lady g arundel bowed respectfully and addressed some words to her i know not what but proper no doubt they were and becoming he ushered him next to me and then methought his eye bespoke a sudden sensibility the color came and went upon his cheek and he was silent but his look was eloquent and my responsive heart held converse in the same mute language with him i was not then as now a spectacle so pale and sickly it was languor not disease and such a languor only as disposed my heart to every soft impression it was evening a soft and tender gloom threw his fine form into that happy shade which gives the features a pathetic tint in harmony with all the melting passions of the soul  oh jane that moment was my fate he then exchanged a look with me that sunk into my heart it was then i found there is no metaphor in what the poets tell of love i felt that he has real arrows my father called for music why did he so it is the food of love and mine had stomach for it all i sung it was my favorite cantabile of sacchini it was love again love in its most expressive language arundels accompanyment inspired me to acquit myself better than ever i performed before his tones were pitched with so much delicacy they were the very echo of my voice my father was enraptured and i confess i never was in such humor with myself  but i am grown childish and prattle the same rhapsody over again which i have pestered you with in a former letter bear with my weakness gentle jane  the next day took my lord to town and arundel remained with us but night and sad reflection had intervened reason had now conjured up a powerful and gloomy antagonist in the person of despair who was able to contest the point with love and represented to my mind a numerous train of impossibilities ranged in dreadful array against the hopeless passion that was taking possession of me alarmed at the danger of my situation i no longer invited opportunities of conversing with arundel i even avoided his eyes as much as i was able i saw with pleasure that my mother began to engross him wholly and i never was a party in their evening walks i dreaded the fascinating powers of music and he conceiving that the exertion was too great for my strength never prompted me to sing much of the day he passed out of doors with my lady in visiting her conservatory and in other rural occupations which she takes much delight in our amusement within doors chiefly consisted in his reading to us and at those times i took care to employ myself with my needle bestowing no more than the attention of one sense upon him but even that sense was made an avenue to love love could even there plant eyes and though at one entrance quite shut out shone inward he gave us the pathetic novel of lady julia mandeville what weakness tempted me to select it for his reading the story was too apposite the catastrophe too touching could he want a key to the fable when my tears were so plain a comment to point out the application where was his intelligence if it escaped him  and now my dearest jane i have lost sight of him perhaps for ever now then is the moment to begin a noble effort and found a resolution that shall repair the ruins of my peace i will forget him  stop let me not promise too much i will not attempt impossibilities i will forget to love him convinced as i now am that he does not entertain a thought of me i will call home those slighted affections whose forward tenders have been repulsed with scorn i have a pride of nature that is the very palladium of my heart i will summon every passion to its aid and it will be hard if such an army of allies shall not be a match for one single unsupported propensity however strong assist me at this crisis my beloved friend encourage me with your applause second me with your counsels say every thing for me but on your allegiance breathe not a word for sir george  and above all things if you love me and would wish to preserve my senses utter not a syllable in profane dispraise of arundel  farewell letter xxxiii lady louisa g to lady jane s when i wrote to you last i was not aware that matters had gone to such lengths between my father and mother as to make a separation necessary ever since that unhappy affair at spring grove my lord has harbored such resentment in his mind and been so obstinately resolved to believe that she has been industrious to prejudice me against sir george revel that i am persuaded nothing but an absolute acquiescence on my part could have undeceived him i must have made a total sacrifice of my happiness to have preserved any tolerable harmony between my parents but even this would have been a very precarious reconciliation for the essentials of love are wanting and though my fathers views might have been served by the match i have reason to know that my mother would have been rendered infinitely more miserable by such a fatal measure than by what has now befallen her which though painful for the present will save her from many sufferings hereafter  you may think perhaps that i might have quashed the dispute at once by peremptorily refusing sir george and taking it entirely on myself but believe me that would never have done nor would my mother hear of the proposal when i stated it assuring me that it would only make my father more outrageous against her with the further bad consequence of reviving the affair between arundel and sir george who was only led to make an apology by the hopes held out to him by my father  i have however confided to her my intentions with respect to that gentleman and the joy and comfort which it gave her alleviated the pains of parting she beseeched me to temporize some time longer as well on her own account as to prevent an immediate rupture between the parties so newly reconciled this you will allow is a delicate and difficult part for me to act but this i have nevertheless promised to undertake  you will be curious to know if i opened to her on the subject of arundel i did not and without giving you all my reasons for being silent i shall only say that if ever i find it necessary to communicate with her on the state of my heart toward that person it will be best done by letter after a time and in absence from each other i know the strength of her mind and the solidity of her understanding retirement and solitude so formidable to some spirits will to here is be salutary and restorative then will be the time if reason cannot expel this hopeless passion to confide it to her  alas to what purpose even then  i have not seen arundel since he left us i believe he gives up his time almost entirely to his uncle with whom he lives and who is said to be in a very declining state i am ashamed to say that my father did himself no honor by the manner in which he treated him at parting and what makes it worse he at that time was not informed of the change in his fortune but talked to him as to an absolute dependant and menaced him with stirring up his fathers displeasure against him no sooner had he left the house than a letter from sir francis revealed the affair of the duel and of arundels adoption in consequence of it then it seems my lord was mortified in the extreme and repented of his behavior and of such consequence is it to his politics to preserve a good understanding with sir francis that i have reason to believe if my mother would have undertaken to have made his peace with arundel she might have made her own at the same time this i know for certain that my father has bestirred himself very assiduously in hopes of healing the breach and has been with the general and no doubt with arundel himself for that purpose how he has succeeded in conciliating matters i cannot pretend to say but he hinted to me that he had obtained a respectable situation for arundel if he chose to accept it  my opinion goes with my fears that the thing is irretrievable and the more so from the unjust and cruel measures which have been taken toward my unoffending mother  what i suffered upon parting from her no words of mine can describe her spirits thank heaven were greatly supported in those painful moments by the assurances i gave her with regard to sir george revel she is for the present gone to spring grove where she will pass only a few days till preparations can be made for her removal to a greater distance and a place provided for her which she has chosen for her retirement and for which she is now in negotiation  my father has invited mrs courtenhall to be with me in my mothers absence what a substitute sir george revel dines here today en famille and i am to endure his hateful presence  farewell letter xxxiv arundel to charles mortlake i will not relate to you the manner in which lord g and i parted as it refers to matters of a domestic nature which i never troubled you with and probably never shall the man is altogether so contemptible that it is impossible for me to be upon any terms with him though he makes strong solicitation for it my whole time is dedicated to my uncle whose love and kindness to me increase with every hour he now talks of his son with a tender regret but not with those passionate gusts of sorrow which for some days he gave way to in the mean time his health declines daily he has certainly had a paralytic stroke for his mouth is visibly drawn aside and his speech affected though we do not take any notice of it to him  wait till you see whether i deserve your congratulations before you offer them in good truth my friend there is so sudden a revolution in my fortune and the world breaks in upon me with such a torrent that it will be well if i can stem it with any tolerable steadiness if fate had sent me back again to those beloved scenes on which my memory dwells with fondness and where tranquillity and you inhabit my lot would probably have been happier than it is likely to prove how shall i preserve my integrity amidst the corruptions of the world my understanding in the din of folly or my religion in the company of the profane be thou my guardian genius and from thy untainted bosom convey the sympathetic spark to mine which may awaken conscience before too deep a sleep invades it  but how is this to be done if we are to remain in such distant separation from each other my selfish spirit has been at work to devise the means of drawing you to me and i please myself with the hope that i have at last struck upon a project that will effect it my uncle has a living in his gift the incumbent of which is now dropping into his grave with age and infirmities the family mansion stands in the parish and the premises of the parsonage communicate with arundel park it is in the finest part of the county of kent upon the banks of the medway in a healthful spot a good house and a charming little garden what do you think of it does it sound as if it would tempt you if so i have already secured the reversion of it at your service we shall be near neighbors if i live to succeed to the possession of arundel house where i mean to fix my staff your parish is but small so that your human flock will not be more than the shepherd of their souls can watch over with his own eye it is enough for me to remind you they are kentishmen and worthy all the care you can bestow upon them dont attempt to take their batts from them and i flatter myself you may prevail with them to relinquish the brandy bottle were it not for this foreign enemy to their health and morals the fatal consequence of illicit trade what a people would they be a race distinguishable above all their fellow subjects for the beauty of their persons the dignity of their sentiments the courage of their hearts and the elegance of their manners  i am only afraid you will grow too rich upon your income for it is beyond your simplicity but why do i fear this when charity is at hand to take off all your superfluities and who can tell charles but some naiad of the medway may tempt you to the rash unphilosophical act of matrimony if that takes place prepare yourself for a family that shall vie with the patriarchs for they have an hereditary gift of breeding and fulfill the primaeval blessing in its utmost extent  this shall be a separate letter unmixt with baser matter for this is a subject which involves a great share of the happiness which i have now to expect in life and i shall anxiously wait your answer  i have other things to talk of which are merely matter of communication and them you will receive in a separate packet by the same conveyance  farewell letter xxxv arundel to charles mortlake i think i told you in the early part of our correspondence that i was not fond of writing about family matters and telling long uninteresting stories of persons and things which you are not concerned with and which i have no right over i am not however scrupulous to inform you that lady g has been compelled to a separation by the illtreatment of her lord who is pressing on a match with sir george revel and lady louisa and is pleased without any grounds to conclude that his wishes have been traversed by her ladyship with whom he has also done me the unmerited honor to suppose that i have been in league for the same purpose  this ridiculous man who has not a trace in his mind that resembles justice unless obstinacy be one had the absurdity to charge me with this to my face and in the presence also of his lady my part of the charge was easily settled for i was soon out of his power but it was not so with lady g she has been obliged to take refuge from his tyranny by retiring from her family which she actually put into effect the same evening and is now seeking that repose in solitude which in his society it was not possible for her to enjoy  for that excellent lady my heart will ever retain the warmest gratitude and it gives me unspeakable pain to be no longer in a capacity of paying her those attentions from which she used to derive no small degree of consolation i have taken every means in my power since her departure of making known to her how deeply i am impressed with the remembrance of her kindness and condescension and how ardently i shall seize every opportunity of manifesting the truth of my professions but i have not thought it advisable in the present state of affairs to write to her though i am vain enough to think it may be what she wishes at the present moment her situation is extremely critical and i am under great anxiety on her account if her difficulties increase and this injurious man continues to persecute her with fresh insults i shall break through the reserve i have for the present imposed upon myself and attempt whatever honor gratitude and friendship can suggest for her service  lady louisas match with sir george revel is i suppose in a train to take place and probably only waits the reestablishment of her health report is circulating it as a thing decided but in that i do not place absolute faith if it must be so may i be deceived in the prejudice i have taken up against the man of her choice i know not how to think there can be any generous sentiments in that heart which seems engrossed with pride and arrogance at the same time i am loath to suppose her capable of overlooking character in the choice of a husband and of following either the mere impulse of the eye or the meaner motives which the greatness of his fortune may appear to suggest this i am sure can never operate upon a nature so liberal and so noble as here is and accordingly i must believe she discerns some qualities in her lover which have not fallen under my observation and to own the truth this may well be as i have only contemplated him in the unfavorable moments of insolence and anger  the day before i quitted the family i had a conversation with lady louisa which was very interesting and if i had been disposed to put my own meaning upon certain passages and expressions which were equivocal enough to encourage such an idle interpretation i might have made a fine fool of myself truly yet if all that anxiety to prevent our duel was the sole result of her fears for the safety of sir george any man who was a witness to what she suffered might have safely sworn that the first moment of his release would have been the first of his happiness also instead of which many days have passed and i have no reason to believe he is yet in possession of her absolute consent  surely charles it is fair arguing to conclude that if he was indeed the object of her love i who in that interview appeared before her as his antagonist ought to have been the object of her aversion yet this did not seem to be the case it is true she had a point to carry and that might lead her to use soothing words in conversing with me but had there been that abhorrence in her heart it is less possible with her than with any body i ever met with to disguise her looks and counterfeit a complacency she does not feel on the contrary i beheld nothing but the sweetest countenance mixed with the most affecting sadness at all times there was a most expressive tenderness in her eyes and once she gave a loose to her tears covering her beautiful face to conceal from me the disorder she was in  these words in particular made an impression upon me at the time she uttered them and i have frequently revolved them in my thoughts since as something too mysterious for me even to guess at  perhaps said she you have mistaken me in some particulars but time will clear up all things to time i must refer you and by that i shall be justified in your opinion  if time that is to be the interpreter of this mystery should show me that sir george is all this while following a false clue through the labyrinth of disappointment  oh charles  but i will not indulge the idea  she must be his and i will detach my thoughts from her and fly the sight of her when sacrificed to that wretch as i would avoid the contemplation of a noble mind when deprived of its reason  these ladies mother and daughter might almost pass for sisters there is a striking similitude in their features and an expression of the same passions and affections in their eyes only at different periods of life and in different degrees of sensibility in the mother it is visible that sorrow has conspired with time to soften down those fires which nobody who looks upon the daughter can behold unmoved the soul of lady g is of that pensive and feeling cast which leans to retirement and those tranquil scenes of life to which humble unassuming virtue delights to resort from the tumult of the world the country is her passion and in a private condition she might have tasted that serenity which her elevated rank only helps to deprive her of fortune seemed to have destined her to those views for which nature had fitted her disposition but an uncommon share of beauty and the extreme elegance of her figure in a luckless hour caught the eyes of lord g and the ambition of her parents devoted her to his arms oh charles how you would be charmed with her society how curiously has nature mixed up the elements in her that the contagious sphere in which she has moved could never fix a spot which even the microscopic eye of envy could spy out and say  here is a blemish  lord g who treated me with very little delicacy when he looked upon me as a dependant now sees me with different eyes and an event which does not raise me one atom in my own esteem adds cubits to my stature in his way of measuring mankind in a time like this when parties are so nearly balanced the proprietor of a borough may expect a very low bow from a tottering minister and his lordship who probably feels himself in that predicament seems to think a little management may be necessary to bring me back to my allegiance and make me still the creature of his purposes  with this wise end in view he called upon my uncle and began to round him with many fine speeches feeling his way cautiously to discover how much i had imparted to him of what passed between us upon our last conversation he affected to be shocked when the general told him i considered myself as dismissed in the most peremptory manner and desired to apologize to me in person for any misunderstanding that had taken place protesting that his intentions had ever been most friendly toward me he hoped we should always be upon good terms and as he had been honored with my uncles support flattered himself he might depend upon mine  to all this sir francis coldly replied that he must refer his lordship to me he had discharged his mind of all those matters and left me entirely to my own discretion  this produced an interview between his lordship and me he addressed me in a fine speech crammed with many courtly flourishes in which there was a mighty deal of condescension abundance of flattery some apology many professions and no truth it was pride that licked the dust  i answered him in as civil terms as i could use without committing myself in such a manner as might lead him to believe i was imposed upon by his professions i took care to remind him for my future justification that i had happily for myself never been in those confidential habits with his lordship as to tie me down from any measures or opinions i might think fit to adopt hereafter and i begged leave to assure him that if i had not felt myself my own master in those respects i would never have consented to come into parliament  he now tried a new experiment by proposing to me a situation in the corpse diplomatique where he could make an opening for me at ratisbon which he warmly recommended as a first step in the line and for which he was pleased to assure me that i was peculiarly well qualified both by nature and acquirements  to this i shortly answered that as i had his lordships own authority to refer to for expecting no favors from him so i had formed my own resolution to receive none he must therefore excuse me if i declined any offers he could make me  thus we parted and thus i conclude  farewell letter xxxvi dr arundel to francis arundel every thing that i hear of your proceedings astonishes me more and more  by a letter which i have been honored with from the earl of g i am informed of the haughty and disdainful manner in which you have quitted his family and when he condescended to court your acceptance of a situation that his interest had provided for you and to which your proudest ambition would not have ventured to aspire awhile ago you rejected his favors with contempt  is this the use you make of your new fortune is this your gratitude to providence  i suppose you will again tell me you are obeying the commands of your uncle to him who has adopted you i commit you i blush whilst i subscribe myself  your father joseph arundel  letter xxxvii francis arundel to dr arundel if you will credit the protestations of a son who never yet approached his father with a falsehood you will believe me when i assure you that i am as innocent of the charge contained in your last letter as i am of the duel which you imputed to me in your preceding one  i cannot enter into a more particular defense of myself as the charge consists of assertions which can only be opposed by counterassertions  i certainly did decline lord gs offer and though it was of a sort entirely incompatible with my present views yet i am free to own that if it had been in all other respects desirable yet as coming from his lordship i could in no case have accepted it  i am etc  letter xxxviii the countess of g to the hon mrs dormer spring grove i have now advanced one stage toward my exile and am preparing to set out in a few days for the place of my final destination  there is a little village on the coast of kent which i have fixed upon for my retreat it has been a favorite spot with me from my childhood being about three miles from my fathers house where i was born it was part of his estate but being entailed upon the male heir now belongs to my first cousin who has very readily accommodated me with the hire of it  this will be my asylum from a tyranny no longer supportable  the bitterness of parting from my louisa was greatly softened by the comforting expressions with which she cheared my sinking spirits in those painful moments  oh my beloved mother said the generous girl the cruel treatment you unjustly suffer on my account cuts me to the soul submit to it however with patience for a time resign yourself to the will of god and he will support you perhaps it is a dispensation that will prove a blessing to you in the end and even now you should forbear to lament it as it withdraws you from a scene replete with sorrows and from an oppression you can no longer endure the virtues of your heart and the strength of your understanding will supply you with resources in your solitude and it shall be my grateful task to relieve it by a continual intercourse of letters in which i will give you a faithful journal of my time i trust my fathers animosity will not forbid my continuing to you these proofs of duty and affection without which our separation would be intolerable to me  i leave you my dear child i replied with a bleeding heart comforted however by these dutiful expressions and penetrated by the generous and tender proofs of your affection i leave you in a painful perilous moment in the very crisis of your fate but i am driven from my duty i do not desert it if you marry sir george revel because your heart is with him and your judgment approves of his character i hope god will bless you in your choice and that i shall find myself in an error but if you take him upon any other motives if your fathers commands overruled you if the splendour of fortune allures you and the cry of the world provokes your vanity to be the richest bride in england i tremble for the consequences i protest against the deed  to this she replied  how i shall regret you words cannot describe but if ever it is my lot to marry it shall be the first object of my liberty to fly to your arms and be assured i will never unite myself to any man whom you could not love and who would not love you this reason alone would have been decisive against sir george revel had he been in all other respects as much to be approved of as i now think he is justly to be abhorred  what cried i what is it i hear does my louisa mean to say that she will not marry sir george revel  never she replied nor force nor persuasion shall prevail with me i will die before i will do it this has been my fixed determination from the first but i would not impart it to my dear mother whilst she was asserting in her defense to my father that she had not communicated with me on the subject  generous creature said i then i am comforted indeed this sweetens the bitterest moment of my life now i can part from my child with some fortitude and so saying i enfolded her in my arms and shed a shower of grateful tears upon her neck  thus was i consoled by this amiable creature and amidst the agonies i feel in separation from her i support myself by reflecting that a young woman of her uncommon attractions with great fortune and high rank to set them off cannot long remain single and then my lost happiness will be recovered in the mean time as my interference in the choice of a husband for her would only draw resentment upon me and probably opposition to her wishes from my unfriendly lord it may be well for me to be absent at this crisis  and now my dear animated friend do not let this secret of louisas determination against sir george revel escape from your lips do not so much as endanger it by a hint for it is necessary to temporize a little longer  will you visit me in my hermitage i am sure you will your friendship is not of that holiday sort which can only show itself in the sunshine of fortune you will not fly from the house of mourning but will cheer your widowed friend in her affliction  but remember my good soul there is one subject that cannot cheer me any longer let the name of arundel be proscribed in our correspondence henceforward sport not with the feelings of your friend nor let your roving imagination lead me any more over rocks and precipices like a deceitful meteor in the night i fly to conquer i sink into solitude that i may teach myself to forget  since he left our house i have never once set eyes upon him nor has he written one farewell line to me it is well he refines upon propriety he points me out the road which i must take he is at once my preceptor and my model  i have the happiness to hear he is recovered of his wound the old general by the way has had a paralytic stroke and is thought to be near his end arundel will then be master of a noble fortune he takes his seat in parliament as soon as the writ can be made out and i cannot doubt but he will do himself much honor in the senate for he has genius knowledge and elocution with every exterior grace of person  how captivating a voice so exquisitely tuned to persuasion that the ear which listens to its harmony of force surrenders up the soul of every one that hears it his eyes characterize each passion as it shifts within him they beam with benevolence they melt with love they flash with anger they penetrate the heart who can resist them  i will risque a prediction that his artillery will be pointed at my lord personally at his party collectively and though i am not curious after politics i cannot avoid hearing from all sides that our cabinet totters be it so i believe the best wish i can bestow upon my despot is that of a speedy dissolution to his power small minds are not made for great stations they are intoxicated by authority that virtuous ambition which should inspire them to advance the glory of their country beats not in their bosoms the passion they feel is spurious and illegitimate it has the name of ambition perhaps but it inherits not its dignity nor property the servant of the public should have the diligence fidelity and punctuality of a servant in humble degree a person destined by his office to refuse multitudes where he gratifies one should above all things study the art of denying with a good grace this demands an attribute which my unhappy lord is wholly destitute of suavity of manners i even question if he is often lucky enough to gain a friend where he bestows a favor i suspect that he will fall unpitied and deserted when that hour comes reflection may come with it and if he then brings his past conduct under strict review the future may very probably fare the better for it  heaven grant it may  i have sometimes turned my thoughts toward a companion in my retirement some quiet gentle soul who will sympathize with my feelings read work walk with me by turns and wile away the languid hours in harmless conversation but alas it is in vain to look for such a being a gentlewoman she must be and i have such pity for decayed gentlewomen in the character of dependants that i should be a sufferer by her society and instead of finding comfort from her be obliged to find it for her i therefore give up that idea altogether and determine to take with me only one young woman who is at present an underling in my family and seems a sensible goodhumoured girl she shall be my lady of the bedchamber for my own madam is too fine for the service and has besides an attachment which i cannot propose to remove her from a housemaid and a cook i shall hire in the country as better for my humble purposes than those of a town education one manservant i shall also take of rural stock and a gardener this will be my establishment my pinmoney will be my revenue and so   farewell to all my greatness adieu letter xxxix charles mortlake to arundel quick transitions of fortune act upon the mind as sudden changes of climate do upon the constitution the stamina must be strong that can bear them  you are scarce entered upon lifes drama when mark how full of incidents it is become whilst you are stepping on the stage the supreme director of its movements draws off the scene before you and you find yourself in a new situation in a new character  prepare yourself therefore for an active part that will try all your powers but above all things my dear arundel let me recommend to you to consult the spirit and sense of your author enter into his designs be the faithful representative of his mind and dont lay out for the false and flattering plaudits of the theater by outstepping nature and violating the chaste simplicity of truth  with all due submission to the mock majesty of honor who is the great manager that now seems to pitch the tone for all our young performers i cannot say that the disciples of his training are to my taste i think it is a false style of acting and though his school is in such high vogue it is not there i would wish a friend of mine to form and fashion himself  i am mistaken if there is not a much better master and guide one whose instructions point to the heart who can draw out the whole soul of the actor into the part he performs and secure him an applause when the drama closes and the curtain drops from that tribunal in whose judgment there is no error let the current of prejudice run as it will in favor of honor may my friend ever be found in that happy minority which adheres to the precepts of religion  no more then of sir george revel i applaud your forbearance may he profit by it and be convinced by your example that true courage does not consist in ferocity he probably is indebted for his life to your magnanimity and so farewell to all my fears shall i be frighted when a madman stares with your duel ends my dispute a fatal instance is too near at hand to escape your notice and i would not wish to enforce my argument by referring to it  will nobody convince that lord g that a proud man is the most contemptible being in nature is it not hard this obvious truth is known to all the world but those whom it applies to i now perceive he is a very blundering politician the man is not fit for the trade he follows who would pretend to set up in his business without brains and where must they have been when he overlooked your talents and did not see the weapons of an orator till he felt them in his vitals is this fellow qualified to be the steersman of the state who has not the wit to take in his sails till the hurricane surprises him away with such a sleepy palinurus i am turned over once more to my old side and feel myself more comfortable in my opposition quarters  we read your maiden speech in our coffeehouse club and took every word for granted as the papers gave it though perhaps you would tell us it is no more like your speech than i to hercules i want no better proof of his lordships unhandsome dealings with you than this evidence of your unmerciful dealings with him and i am sure if you had ever been let into his heart as a friend nothing would have tempted you to lay it open as a foe ridiculous inconsiderate man nobody would have required of him as a politician to act from the heart but every one will condemn him for want of common skill and contrivance it is plain he has not studied even the first principles of his profession i shall not wonder if he is hooted out of the cabinet what a miserable figure will he make at that work when it is notorious to all the world that his right hand has forgot its cunning  but he is also at enmity with his most excellent lady  and who can wonder at this when was folly not at war with understanding when was madness reconciled to reason he does right he follows his proper course downwards according to the true backslidings of nature who shall stop him he is fairly launched from the slip and presses headlong to the gulf that shall receive him  lend me your ear arundel and i will whisper to you a secret which is not fit for any creature but yourself to listen to  there is a certain lady who is not insensible to you how i come to discover this is no matter you may be a cautious writer but i am an inquisitive reader who this lady is what her description age and person i shall not say whether walking and conversing with you in the country or attending upon you during your confinement in town whether instructing you as a monitress or receiving instruction from you as a disciple whilst you trace out the constellations in the heavens to her uplifted eyes by night in whatever act attitude or employment i contemplate this your amiable companion i recognize a character which i cannot be mistaken in though sorrow may conspire with time to soften down those fires that are so bright in younger eyes yet they are fires which by their gentleness only lure to a nearer approach and that sorrow which softens the beholder also into pity and raises up no inconsiderable advocate in the heart  but what has a monk to do you will say with speculations of this sort certainly they are no thesis for the schools yet love has its pupils even within the walls of a college and nature can instruct without the help of a lecturer however as i am neither pupil nor professor i shall totally drop a subject i have no right to speak upon  your recovery from a dangerous wound has been followed by a sudden change of fortune which in the language of the world will be called a very singular instance of good fortune let me therefore take the worlds opinion upon trust and join your friends in felicitating you upon your late adoption why should i not the estate that will now devolve upon you is the estate of your family it has ever been in the list of contingencies and you are not taken by surprise as many are upon whom chance throws her favors and without preparation elevates the prostrate son of earth into the upstart man of consequence i give it welcome therefore as an event which affords your talents a display and enlarges the sphere of your activity i flatter myself i shall be able to appeal to one instance of a great fortune rationally enjoyed you will neither languidly submit to be the prey of servants or the dupe of sharpers you have ever lived in habits of temperance and who that has once experienced the blessings of pure simplicity will prostitute his health understanding and conscience to a life of voluptuousness you are not thank heaven in danger of being seized by the sordid rage of gaming for you cannot wish so to employ a superfluity which your taste can dispose of so much more elegantly and your spirit bestow so beneficently  that you may reap the first fruits of that generous disposition with all possible satisfaction to your feelings i accept with thankfulness the promise of your benefice in kent and assure you that it opens to me every prospect of happiness your friendly heart can wish it to be accompanied with  every circumstance about it house garden demesne the country river parish the people themselves all conspire to render it the most delectable situation to me in life and more than all its neighborhood to arundelhouse stamps a double value on the gift  i shall be ordained deacon next sunday and i have reason to believe my lord of ely will not refuse me priests orders very shortly after i certainly enter upon this office in humble hope and with a serious mind i have well reflected upon the nature of our church establishment and am resolute to abide by all its forms ordinances and articles as therein laid down without deviation for i hope i am incapable of prevaricating with an oath and entering upon these solemn engagements with an unsteady wavering allegiance no arundel i will imitate the sectaries in nothing but their diligence and industry neither will i enter the pale of peace and charity with a heart that can be hardened by a spirit of intolerance and bigotry  to be a good priest in a country parish such as you describe is the height of my wishes and if they succeed nothing shall tempt me out of my station where i fix there i will fall your kentishmen shall have me such as i am once and for ever for them i will live and amongst them i will die i am no seeker after change or preferment nor when i am the servant of god will i submit to be the slave of ambition  it appears to me that some clergymen seem to think their whole duties are comprised in the services of the seventh day but when so many instances happily occur to show the great moral advantages which may be derived to a parish from the careful superintendance of a minister who resides constantly amongst them it is a strong call upon a mans conscience to stand by his trust and consider every day in the week no less a day of duty than the seventh as to what concerns the task of preaching only my idea is that a congregation is first to be instructed in the religion they profess and that morality will spring from religion as the fruit from the tree i have therefore no partiality for those slight essays so much in vogue which seem composed for fashionable freethinkers and one would almost suppose if charity did not forbid the imputation that they were even composed by freethinkers this kind of flimsy doctrine like fairweather sailing that may be performed with any ordinary tackle is very convenient for indolent divines as it requires little labor and no depth of study preachers who court popularity from polite congregations affect to suit their language to their company and avoiding all harsh truths tell them rather what they like than what they ought to hear the crimes that cry out for correction are left untouched and the lash only applied where nobody present can be hit by it  for my part though i would with great care avoid puzzling the understandings of my rural flock yet i conceive it is very feasible in plain and easy language and by natural deductions to proceed systematically in a chain of discourses through all the necessary proofs of revealed religion if this were done in a concise intelligible manner and so methodized as the memory might retain it i should expect it would enable an attentive congregation even in a country parish to give a reason for the faith that is in them and with this view it might be proper to repeat it as occasion seemed to require upon this system once established in the mind all the moral duties of christianity might be grounded not in a vague and desultory manner but in the chain and order of their dependancies one upon another for i take it as a point admitted that teachers of all sorts must proceed by method if they mean to fix in their hearers memories what they essay to teach listen to the rambling arguments of a man who has no mathematical principles in his head and though he talks to you in the diction of tully they will be words without ideas a mere cluster of unmeaning sentences it is my purpose therefore if it ever is my lot to have a steady congregation under my care so to connect my sermons as may lead my hearers step by step through a course of chrictian doctrine as if i was solving a proposition in geometry and i will venture to pronounce that whoever analyzes the whole series and system of revelation in this manner will find his faith established by the process as clear and incontrovertible as any mathematical truth founded upon demonstration  farewell letter xl lady louisa g to lady jane s i am so haunted by sir george revel and suffer his visits with so ill a grace that i can wear the mask no longer and must positively give him a flat refusal the very next time he baits me with his odious addresses  my father begins to find he has gained nothing upon me by my mothers absence and grows very impatient he is astonished what i can discover in sir george to object to and then runs over a number of particulars every one of which he thinks the best recommendation a man can have and i think the sum total would not weigh against one grain of merit oh arundel if nature had not given me a heart to despise these vanities you would have taught me  whilst my father is for ever tutoring and tormenting me in private my disappointed lover runs bellowing up and down abusing me to all the world as the veriest coquette and jilt in nature and i have too good reason to believe that his animosity against my exiled mother provokes him to say very base and scandalous things against her i live in daily terror lest any of these reports should come round to arundels ears whose spirit would not bear a word to be said against lady g  that gentleman has made his debut in parliament by taking a decided part in opposition i should make a lame story of it if i were to attempt at giving you particulars but i can assure you the whole town rings with his applauses and what is worst of all our ministers lost their question as they call it so that i believe no question now remains but they will lose their places every one of the junto are outrageous against my poor father for letting such a genius as arundel slip through his hands and this with the affair of my mother has opened all mouths violently against him though i am persuaded he feels his error poignantly enough without any of these reproaches to aggravate his regret  the eloquence the youth the person of arundel who was known to scarce a member in the house had an astonishing effect juvenile orators have oftentimes come out with credit in a set speech rehearsed as it were by heart but this new phenomenon in parliament was two hours in his reply to one of the best speakers on the side of administration by which he established his reputation beyond all example  as his affair with sir george revel has been greatly talked of it interested the attention of the house in an extraordinary degree when that gentleman who with all his members is come over to the ministers side rose as soon as arundel had sat down and undertook to reply to him he began with some vehemence to retort upon him for the unhandsome part he was taking appealing to the candor of the house to judge if it was becoming for a man so new in his seat and one who had been so lately initiated as an humble dependant on a noble lord high in office into the privacy of his family to avail himself of the intelligence he had gleaned imperfectly as it appeared but certainly not very honorably in his service for the purpose of employing it against the very patron who had admitted him into his confidence that noble lord he could say from his own knowledge was entitled to a better return as he had shown himself no less ready to bestow favors than to forgive offenses and though his bounty had not been accepted he humbly conceived it ought not to have been forgotten  the gentleman from whose account i took down these particulars for your information said the house seemed to feel the indelicacy of sir george revels appeal considering what had lately passed and were very much disposed to interfere and call him to order but as soon as arundel took up his reply in which he conducted himself with great coolness and discretion the silence and attention were almost without precedent  in justifying himself from the charge of ingratitude and doubledealing he went through a manly yet modest detail of his own proceedings during his connection with my father and of the reasons which dissolved it these indeed he touched with great delicacy yet opened as much as sufficed very fully for his own vindication when he came to speak of the melancholy event which had wrought so great a change in his fortune and condition all eyes were turned upon the venerable old general who though in the last stage of infirmity and in deep mourning for an only son had seated himself by his side a solemn murmur ran through the house every nerve seemed to vibrate with the pathos of the scene the feeble veteran put his handkerchief to his eyes the crisis was too affecting arundels voice trembled stopped he paused awhile and then resuming his discourse with greater energy he broke forth into so fine a flow of eloquence awakened all the feelings of his hearers and struck the strings of pity with so masterly a hand that decency could scarce restrain the house from exclamations of applause twas then he turned his defense into attack and made so fierce a sally into his opponents quarters that he raised a general indignation against the very person whom he had been accused of being ungrateful to he asserted to the conviction of all that so far from betraying a benefactor he had suffered under an oppressor  that he could not abuse a confidence he had never enjoyed  and that the offer he had refused was the result of fear not favor and would have been disgraceful to accept but what was remarked particularly to his credit was that not a word of personality toward sir george revel escaped from his lips not a look that marked contempt not a syllable that breathed defiance  thus you have the whole fairly transcribed from a very correct reporter of what passed on that memorable debate which was closed with the speech above related and finished by a division in which the ruling powers were overthrown a defeat which i know enough of your politics my dear jane to believe you will not be very sorry for  farewell letter xli lady louisa g to lady jane s i have at last peremptorily broke with sir george revel and am free  no penitent ever returned from absolution so lightened in conscience as i am by what i have done i felt myself acting a part of duplicity which i must take the liberty to say was a character entirely out of my cast and of course very awkwardly performed  a fine man of sir georges sort who looks upon the whole female world as drawn out in review for him in his imperial humor to throw his handkerchief to the chosen fair brooks the insult of a repulse very ill if he had not loved himself infinitely more than he did me his disappointment would have been intolerable but as my opinion cannot lower him in his own he seemed rather to pity my bad taste than deplore his own hard fate  on the evening of the day i last wrote to you i went to the opera and sir george revel by privilege of custom came into my box he was more than commonly troublesome and as my attention was particularly engrossed by a certain person in the pit i was not in the best humor in the world to confess the truth to you that certain person was arundel who was sitting by old lady treville and as it seemed in earnest conversation with her  i had fixed my eyes upon him so attentively that sir george by following their direction soon discovered the object at which they were pointed  i perceive said he your ladyship has found out an acquaintance you are looking at our new orator but i should suppose you can find no great pleasure in contemplating ingratitude though at a distance  to this i made no answer and he proceeded  the vanity of that fellow is insufferable he comes here on purpose to be stared at but though curiosity should draw every eye upon an upstart novelty yours at least methinks should be averted from the foeprofessed and slanderer of your father  as you have had a full reply to that already i suppose you do not expect one from me  you need not put your lips to that trouble madam i understand the language of your eyes  not always sir george  when have i failed to interpret rightly  in your own case as i should think  i understand you perfectly madam i can see the passion which prevails when they are turned upon me as i can discover that which animates them whilst they are fixed upon him  hold sir george one conclusion at a time with your leave be as confident as you please in your own case but i desire you will make no conjectures for any other  in my own case then give me leave to tell you lady louisa that if i have been hitherto in a deception as to the real language of your eyes it is because you have hitherto been pleased to conceal them under a mask the instant that you condescend to take it off and let them follow where the impulse of your heart directs them i no longer think the honor of being your admirer can compensate for the disgrace of being rival to your mothers footman  so saying he flounced out of the box and left me in a state of mind in which it was hard to decide whether joy or indignation most preponderated my agitation however was so great between both that i found myself unable to sit out the opera and nobody being with me but mrs courtenhall i apologized to her for the disorder i was in and begged to go home  an embarrassment now ensued about getting up our carriage as we had no gentleman to apply to but depending upon what chance might throw in our way we went down to the lobby to give orders for our servants to be called fortune whether in malice or good will i cannot pretend to say so ordered it that we should there encounter mr arundel alone and going out of the house my distress was visible and his embarrassment no less so he bowed with all possible respect advanced retired then stopped as if uncertain what to do his natural good manners at last decided in our favor and he addressed himself to me to know if i wanted any assistance  would i command him to order up my carriage i accepted his service and he flew to fulfill it a very short time brought him back to tell me the coach was ready and my servants in waiting  may i have the honor of taking care of your ladyship or am i impertinent  that can hardly be i replied though they tell me i am in the enemys hands this i accompanied with a smile as he was in the very act i alluded to  yes lady louisa if he can be called an enemy who would die in your defense  i will not swear to you my sweet jane that whilst he spoke these words he actually did press my hand but i thought he did i felt as if he did the flutter i had been in seized me worse than ever i tottered lost my sight and scarce had power to proceed he certainly did not overlook my disorder for he supported me with the greatest care and stopping to give me time for recovery with a look expressive of the tenderest respect whispered to me  alas you are ill if enemies feel what i feel how can your friends survive it  as you have never heard his voice jane you cannot judge of its effect i will not attempt at the description of it my heart was full it was swelling with indignation against the wretch who had so late insulted my ears with his abuse it was struggling to supply some words that might convince him i did not seriously suppose he was my enemy but in the struggle words were lost tears supplied their place and i had only strength to say  for heavens sake take me to my coach i shall expose myself  he obeyed me but how i know not he conducted me through the crowd put me into the coach placed my companion by my side and we parted without another word  oh jane jane jane i love  give me some stronger word  there is none  what use for language then away with it it cannot reach my passion  i have done  letter xlii lady louisa g to lady jane s another letter i hear you say  yes another  for i must write and you must read  lady treville has been with me she is a dear old generous considerate creature a friend to love and like hope a nurse of young desire i dote upon her to distraction for i am sure she came upon an errand from arundel this morning to enquire after my health she had heard i went home ill from the opera last night  this good lady as you well know has a fine house a great fortune high birth and much vivacity she keeps a circle which is greatly frequented by the fine young men about town particularly by the leaders of that party which is termed the opposition arundel is her prime favorite and i understand is at her house most evenings she told me he had supped with her last night after the opera and i can assure your ladyship says she that though my boy for so she calls arundel is so angry with your father he says the finest things in the world of you  of me i replied methinks i should be curious to know what mr arundel is pleased to commend in me  now i dare say answered lady treville you are prepared to hear a great many compliments passed upon your beauty but i must mortify your expectations by telling you his encomiums were all directed another way which perhaps you may hold to be a great solecism in politeness  pardon me my good lady that is not my way of thinking well then said she with a smile you can well believe that busy people will be meddling with affairs they have no concern in and as a certain sir george revel whom all the ladies think so great a catch has circulated your refusal of him pretty generally there will be different ways of talking about it i believe he has been at some pains to make his own story as good as he can against you now though all the world knows my love and esteem for my dear lady louisa yet it is impossible to keep all mouths shut in a mixed company and i believe some folks take up the worst side for contradiction sake  dear madam there is no need of softening the truth to me i dare say i was soundly abused by some kind soul or other as the arrantest jilt in the kingdom  not so bad as that lady louisa enough however to draw out the handsomest defense from mr arundel i ever heard defense do i call it it was a panegyric that made every female cheek in the room burn with envy it put malice quite out of countenance i can assure you and was followed by a silence which nobody seemed hardy enough to interrupt  at last a grave old gentleman observed that it was as hopeless to convict lady louisa before such an advocate as it was to defend lord g against such an opponent  one of the company observed to me in a whisper that the young lady had probably revenged her fathers quarrel intimating that you my dear had made arundels heart atone for what lord gs had felt  now this was an observation i could neither say yea nor nay to till i had consulted you but if you will give me an answer upon your authority i will be faithful in applying it  but is it necessary i demanded that an answer should be given and if it should does it not rather rest with mr arundel than with me is not he better able to judge of the state of his own heart than i am for him if you wish to know the truth my dear lady had not you better seek it from the fountainhead  oh heavens she cried if he dared to tell me that he was in love with any woman but myself i would tear his eyes out i caught him looking at you at the opera and i sent him away with such a lecture as he will not soon forget i do not know whether i shall let him into my house this evening though i have a little private party of music and shall want his violin now i was thinking if your ladyship will honor me with your assistance at the harpsichord we will send him about his business and show him that we can do without him  i fancy i should be an unwelcome visitor upon those terms you would find me a bad substitute for so fine a performer but as i am persuaded your ladyship has no reason to fear any rival and me perhaps least of any had not you better let him in  then be it so and if he dares to look aside trust me for finding him out nothing is so sharpsighted as jealousy  but remember to come and bring all your charms with you youth beauty love and harmony if i triumph over these my glory will be great indeed  with these words she started up with all the vivacity of a girl and taking me by the hand as she left the room cried out god bless you my dear lady i adore you for your behavior to sir george revel there is but one man living who deserves you  and now my dear jane i leave you a puzzle to amuse yourself with guessing at  do i go or do i not go  that is the question  farewell letter xliii lady jane s to lady louisa g how can you be so nonsensical a chit do you go or do you not go to lady trevilles that is the question indeed no child that is not the question which i shall answer for it answers itself you will not stop at lady trevilles when you are once set agoing if i have any guess at your motions you will have a longer journey on your hands before you are much older for that promotion which we are told comes neither from the east nor from the west nor yet from the south can of course be found no where but in the north and thither you will go in search of it i have heard it said there is an old blacksmith somewhere on the borders of scotland who though but a sooty fellow is in great vogue for his workmanship and much resorted to for a particular kind of chains which i think would suit your ladyships taste to a tittle and perhaps last you to the end of your life now if your my pretty louisa would pay this same blacksmith a visit it would be realizing the old fusty fable of venus and vulcan and to prevent mistakes you may take your aeneas in your hand and let his armor be fitted upon him in the shop i warrant it will then sit close to him  well and how did my dear arundel look at lady trevilles what did he say and how did he fiddle i find he draws a strong bow as my poor lord g can witness i adore him for his politics for i am opposition mad in short my dear we of this house are poor and hungry and i do from my heart hope that arundel will help to smoke out all the hive and let us in for a share of the honey i would venture a good wager louisa that at this very time of writing you are one of us what a happy faculty these young reformers have at converting us maiden pupils to their opinions the wisdom of the aged is but loft upon us it goes for nothing  and so you have had the assurance to refuse a lover whom all the marrying world are pulling caps for and who but you could withstand being the finest gayest richest bride in england to be sure there are a few flaws in sir georges character a few trifling blemishes such as pride ill nature insolence a small propensity to the brute and no want of partiality for dear self but who stumbles at straws and every miss in the kingdom knows that if her husband will not make her happy somebody else will there is always some kindhearted creature ready to take pity upon disconsolate wives if they are willing to make their sorrows known it is my opinion then sir george will never meet a second rebuff unless he would condescend to cast the eyes of his regard upon me oh that his proud stomach would come down so low marry if a poor scottish lassie like me was to send him packing it would break the neck of his pride at once now you can only break his heart honor enough for him that he may boast of having thrown himself at your feet though he has been tossed out of window for his temerity  fie upon it where am i scrambling out of windows the thought of your dear mother meets me by the way and rebukes my idle spirit for its levity when i think of her my heavy heart is like poor king johns in the tragedy  it will not out of windows or of doors oh that i was with her in her solitude tell her i beseech you if she wants a tame creature to run about the house and be faithful to her i am at her service i can hold my tongue when she does not wish to hear me talk and i am too much my own friend not to be silent when she speaks on this side idolatry i have ever loved her more than any other woman but when she was a great lady i forbore to make my court to her as i now wish to do in the decadence of her fortune oh arundel how i love thee for thy gratitude and devotion to the charming lady g lend me but thy cestus my sweet louisa if thou have no employment for it thyself and i will level all my borrowed charms at the heart of that dear darling fellow and save him a trip to the blacksmith for there is not one of my poor kinsfolk but will toss their scotch bonnets in the air for joy at my good luck i warrant him they will set the pipes a squeaking when he comes to fergus castle in the mean time here i live without a lover or even an acquaintance except one solitary tree that stands now in my eye from the castle casement the only ornament of the prospect with whom i have made a friendship as there is a kind of sympathy in our situations being both left naked and alone in the wide world both planted in a bleak and barren soil and alike unsheltered and exposed to all the blasts of heaven i visit it every day and as i stand sighing under its branches the kind creature answers me with a melancholy murmur and rustles every leaf in token of its fellowfeeling it is the very emblem of celibacy for if i was to climb to the top of it i am sure i could not spy out a companion within the range of vision it stands like jephthas daughter bewailing its virginity upon the mountains and being of the evergreen race has the property in common with other old maids of never changing its condition if there had been a flower within a mile of me i would have treated it with a garland but alas no purplefingered hours fling rose fling odours here  within the castle walls all is not habitable that they enclose there are trophies banners and armor in the hall that bespeak the warlike dignity of the house but there is wanting that which should cover its nakedness for it is open to the sky and the bats now perch upon those casques where victory took post in times of yore at the upper end upon a platform elevated by three stone steps is a chair of state for the great lord of the mansion overhung with a canopy of played drapery which in obedience to the laws of the kingdom no longer observes any distinction of colors and woe betide the ambitious chieftain who should dare to enthrone himself under its rotten royalty on each side of this throne are two gothic arches both which in better days were complimented with doors but one only enjoys that distinction at present and this delivers you into a great chamber which we by courtesy call habitable and so it is more properly by contrast for here my venerable ancestors hang by the wall with their names and sexes very considerately told by the painter who would else have bequeathed a riddle to posterity too difficult for us to expound here also sits my living ancestor my noble grandmother in her eightieth year the mother of three earls and the widow alas of two a mournful wreck in second childishness and mere oblivion sans teeth sans eyes sans taste sans every thing and here sit i watching the last ebb of nature in the only relic time and the sword have left me save one beloved brother lord of these ruins the bravest hero and the best of men who is now bearing the english thunder over the waves of the ocean against a world in arms the god of battle giver of all victory protect him and his gallant comrade wherever they are wonder not if i adore the name of arundel when it is the brave john arundel uncle of your francis who is the gallant comrade i allude to with this veteran my brother is now cruising under him he has been trained from a child he it is who has educated fathered and befriended him under his command he is now sailing the disciple in a frigate the master in a line of battle ship by his side perhaps he is fighting arundel taught him to be a seaman heaven made him a hero  farewell letter xliv arundel to the countess of g as your ladyships great kindness has given me a claim upon you for advice in any difficulties i beg leave now to resort to you for your judgment in a case than which nothing can be more interesting to my feelings at the same time that i am doubtful how i ought to act in it with all becoming delicacy toward the party concerned  there is a lady of high rank to whom i am under the greatest obligations and for whom my heart entertains every respectful sentiment of esteem and gratitude now in a very peculiar situation having been exiled from her house and family by the tyranny of her lord and living in a retired and solitary cottage on the seacoast without a friend or companion with her and solaced only by those conscious reflections which the unblemished rectitude of her own virtuous conduct may suggest for her relief and comfort  a heart that overflows for the unmerited sufferings of this amiable exile prompts me to express to her the sensibility with which it is penetrated in her behalf and to attempt at telling her if words could tell what it feels how entirely it is devoted to her  but alas i am doubtful if i ought to do this and am afraid lest the delicacy of her soul might resent the intrusion of my officious zeal upon the sacred privacy of her retirement  you madam to whom all these fine feelings are present will inform me how to act and that you may possess yourself of the case in all its circumstances i beseech of you to put yourself in the predicament of the lady i describe and crediting me for what i profess and even more than i can profess answer as in her person and direct my doubtful judgment how to proceed  if there was a thing within the compass of my faculties to attempt if there was a service to be undertaken for her sake though it involved the sacrifice of my life i have zeal and ardor equal to the task but if this moment when i wish her most to know it is the very moment when i ought not to declare it your decision will impose silence upon me which however painful to preserve i will still persist in for let me suffer any imputation even of ingratitude rather than give occasion to the world but to hint at a suspicion that might sully her immaculate character and furnish an injurious husband with matter for retort  when i was laid up by a wound some time ago she had the tenderest commiseration for my bodily pain shall i not feel pity for her mental agonies now she is wounded in spirit by the sharp fangs of unkindness  letter xlv the countess of g to arundel a solitary being expelled from society seems ill calculated to counsel those who live in it had i possessed the art of accommodating my principles to the tempers and fashions of the world i had not now been exiled to this solitude and yet i have not so soon forgot the manner of all worldly things as to be totally without an answer to the question you put to me  if you on whom the sudden possession of a great fortune has just fallen have begun the career of pleasure as it is called which seldom fails to appertain to it the mode most consonant to the established practice of men of pleasure is to avoid pain and trouble in that case it will be totally out of character and against all rule of selfgratification to concern yourself any further about this melancholy being whose sequestered cottage by the seashore can furnish no delights to you and whose dull society will only damp the spring of pleasure which should know no relaxation or remission of activity in your bosom  on the contrary if amidst the solicitations of the senses you are still awake to the feelings of the soul if you can suppose there is a joy in bestowing comfort to the afflicted and have any taste for the delights which spring from within as well as for those which court you from without then arundel you will turn your steps from those flowery paths where pleasure leads the dance and strike into the narrow winding crag which over rocks and thorns ushers benevolence into the house of mourning you will go to that solitary cottage by the seaside you will visit your afflicted friend and if she is clothed in the armor of virtue she will not fear the shafts of malice  letter xlvi lady louisa g to lady jane s alas my dear jane the hope that gleamed upon my prospect how suddenly is it overcast  no sooner had lady treville left me than my father came into my room for some days i had scarce exchanged a word with him and whenever we met he appeared sullen dull and out of spirits i was willing to ascribe it to the derangement of his political situation and i now understand it to be decided that he is to retire from office and that there will be a total change of ministers  his countenance very sufficiently indicated that i was to encounter his displeasure but when i expected it to break forth as usual with him in some sudden gust of passion he sat deliberately down and without any elevation of voice began by telling me that my conduct toward sir george revel had at last put it out of all doubt that i was in league against him with my mother and that viper meaning arundel whom he had fostered in his bosom yes added he ungrateful child whom i have so foolishly doated on it is not in the nature of things to suppose you would have refused a match so desirable in itself and so much the object of my wishes had you not been combined with those incendiaries under my own roof in a plot against my honor happiness and interest could you be so blind as not to see your mothers glaring partiality for that fellow arundel did she not employ him as her instrument in the first place to affront sir george and when the quarrel did not terminate to her wish but her runner got chastised for his insolence she caballed with him for traversing my measures and turning your affections from their natural bent in his favor to an absolute rejection of him who but she inspired her favorite with those presumptuous notions of himself which broke out with such insolence upon our last interview in this house so that when i calmly took him to task for his officiousness in my family affairs he answered me in such a style that i was necessitated to dismiss him from my service and now when by a sudden shift of fortune he is started into consequence and been brought into parliament what but the stimulations of her resentful persecuting spirit could have provoked him to stand up against me with such personal animosity and in the bitterest strain of invective attempt to blacken and arraign my character who have been the friend that brought him into notice the moving spring of all the undeserved success that has befallen him nay i can well believe that she is capable of furnishing him with hints and heads for his abusive virulent philippic for where should he discover or invent matter for his calumny and how should a raw academic start up at once a politician and declaimer unless some such mischiefmaking meddler had been at work to tutor him in the trade reasons enough these in all conscience for the step i have taken in breaking all connection with your mother and determining upon that separation which i am now resolved shall be as rigidly observed on your part louisa as on mine for henceforward i forbid you even to write to her or correspond with her in any shape and if you dare to transgress these commands i will find means to make you rue the hour you disobey me  here i interposed by reminding him that he had promised both my mother and me upon our parting that i should be permitted to write to her  it is no matter replied he what i promised then i have upon mature reflection now determined otherwise and i see the danger of your intercourse in a stronger light than at that time it appeared to me in take notice also that you had not then declared yourself against sir george revel nay i had every reason to believe you meant to comply with his wishes and mine by giving him your hand did you not encourage this delusion and do you suppose any father can continue to repose the same confidence or affection in a daughter who repays his kindness and betrays his trust by seizing the very first occasion for thwarting all his hopes and projects for her happiness no louisa you have cured me of my partiality and have nothing now to expect from me but justice and a strict attention to prevent your remaining in the hands of those insidious counselors who have already been but too successful in perverting your natural good qualities your judgment your duty who can tell what chimeras may have sprung in your mothers projecting brain since her favorite arundel is become so much the favorite of fortune also both his protectresses are blind alike and you child who have been egregiously blind in one instance may be so in another and with the help of her treacherous instigations for aught i know be trepanned into a passion for that despicable fellow and complete the ruin of my peace for ever  here he cast his eyes upon me and seeing me in confusion exclaimed yes yes you may well be overwhelmed with shame and confusion but remember what i tell you madam were i certain at this moment that you had ever meditated an act of that desperation i would confine you starve you annihilate you sooner than you should so disgrace yourself and combine against your father with his bitterest enemy therefore if you are disposed at once to put my heart to rest and leave it clear from this and every other suspicion comply with my advice gratify me by revoking what has passed with sir george and allow him to renew his addresses to you  here he paused and seemed to expect my answer but finding me silent he proceeded in a milder tone   do this louisa and be again the beloved of my soul be free as air ask what you will and my fondness shall consent to it visit your mother when you will where you will nay if that is your desire bring her home restore her to her family my arms shall then be open to receive and welcome her  but if you will not if you will not do this but still persist in obstinately opposing my desire i exact your solemn vow upon the spot never henceforward to exchange a thought word or look with that villain arundel at any time or upon any occasion and at the same time i forbid all future correspondence with your mother  now take your choice i wait for your reply  ah sir said i whilst the tears gushed from my eyes what an agonizing alternative have you now forced upon my choice are there no means left for appeasing your displeasure but by sacrificing my own happiness no hope of reconciling you to my unhappy mother but by devoting myself before the altar with lying lips and a revolting heart must i never embrace a beloved parent till i join hands with him who is of all men my aversion never be permitted to speak comfort to her affliction till i pronounce the fatal word that sentences me to misery perhaps to guilt for ever is this my choice of horrors are these the allotted portions of wretchedness from which i am now commanded to elect my doom for life  he paused awhile and looked me sternly in the face  then recollecting himself tauntingly replied  your imagination madam may fill both sides of the picture with horrors i conceive they exist only on the reverse of that which it is your duty to choose i am satisfied i propose a gentleman who will make you happy you may have a wretch in your eye whom i hold in my aversion therefore it behooves me to be peremptory i dont wish to be amused by eloquence and declamation i desire only to be answered with sincerity and truth  then my lord i resign into your hands that life which under god you gave me i devote myself to death the last resource of human misery when you have thus disposed of my mother and myself you will have executed the full powers of a husband and a father  whether he was alarmed at the agony with which i uttered these words or awakened by some stings of conscience at the conclusion of them i cannot pretend to determine but he took me gently by the hand and in a low voice said  be comforted louisa i am your father still and cannot forget to love you but regard me as a father and enable me to fulfill the promise by which i have bound myself to sir george revel do not compel me to break the word which i have given him that he shall at least be admitted to renew his addresses to you if i cannot prevail with my child to give him her consent give him at least a hearing at my request surely you will not refuse that to a father and in the mean time i trust you will pledge your honor to me not to converse correspond with or if that can be prevented even to see mr arundel are these unreasonable requisitions louisa will you not grant this moderate request to your father  i were inexcusable if i did not promise you to fulfill every one of these conditions most religiously  then retire to your chamber my dear he replied compose your spirits and be assured i have no other wish in life but to make you happy  thus ended a conversation painful through its whole progress though the violence it commenced with was in some degree softened at the conclusion  these irksome conditions must be observed i shall send an apology to lady treville  oh my jane if i were now standing under thy solitary tree in the bleakest wind that ever shook its weatherbeaten branches i could so arundel were by my side smile on the tempest and enjoy the storm  farewell letter xlvii arundel to charles mortlake it is now in my power to inform you that the old incumbent of packington is dead and the presentation to that living waits your acceptance you will not be in any haste to remove till i have taken a survey of the premises and put things in comfortable order for your reception as you tell me you are resolved to build your nest for life i would fain have it made fit for a tenure which i hope in god will last long and be happy they tell me every thing is in decent repair but be this as it may we will have no talk about dilapidations for i cannot endure to see a parson raking in the ashes of his predecessors and wringing from the hands of widows or of orphans their vile trash let that task devolve upon the patron let the gratification of preparing an asylum for the friend of my life be mine upon this delightful errand i am now setting out and you may depend upon it i shall not let the work sleep in my hands when i am on the spot i will inform you of particulars till then adieu  p s not another word upon the subject of lady g if you have any regard for my peace lady louisa has actually refused sir george revel  divine angelic girl how i adore her i can now for the first time say my wound is healed i am whole again i am just now setting off for lady trevilles where i shall meet her this evening my eyes my ears will be blessed  oh hope my heart embraces thee  tantum   letter xlviii the countess of g to the hon mrs dormer when i was beginning to feel something like a dawn of peace my spirits have been agitated afresh by a letter from arundel guarded indeed respectful and somewhat obscure in its manner but my foolish heart caught at the lure and eagerly embraced the distant offer of a visit  i am at once delighted and alarmed with the idea i reproached yet could not command myself i am sensible i have done wrong i know he ought not to come hither put aside vain and foolish talking and for once give me your sober and sound judgment shall i revoke the invitation i am resolute to obey if you advise it  farewell letter xlix the hon mrs dormer to the countess of g london by no means my ever honored and beloved lady admit the visit of arundel  events have come to pass in your family which perhaps you are not yet apprized of lady louisa has absolutely discarded sir george revel she has had a casual interview with arundel at the opera this i learn from gossip report alias old lady treville i am going to her party this night i am to take up your daughter in my way and i also know that arundel will be there  music is the pretense but take my word for it love is at the bottom of it it is creeping into the world nay it has already crept  need i add another word it would be an insult to your delicacy to your discretion to your maternal feeling i leave it with your own excellent heart to decide  farewell may heaven protect and bless you letter l the countess of g to the hon mrs dormer not for the earth would i admit of a visit from arundel i will put that mischief beyond the reach of chance or temptation i will leave the kingdom immediately  strange as it may appear yet i give you my honor it is true that until i came to this place i did not know sir francis arundel has a family seat in this country and as i am now informed not many miles from the house i am in whether this would or would not have been a motive with me for coming hither when i had a retirement to choose is a question i will not ask of myself let it suffice that it is now become no question at all but downright fate and necessity that i must fly from it forthwith  oh horrible what terrors rush upon my mind of dangers narrowly escaped temptations rashly encountered deliverances providentially vouchsafed  you have now redeemed all former errors your last letter has enclosed an antidote for the poison which your first contained the operation has been severe but the cure is radical the caustic has penetrated to my heart but the canker which would have consumed it is itself consumed you have saved me you have saved yourself and atoned to virtue  why did not my louisa confide to me the very first approaches of her passion how was it that i did not discover them where was my intuition  ah where indeed diverted misapplied engrossed by treacherous propensities blind leaders of the blind  the affair of sir george revel is not new to me what relates to arundel is unexpected but when i recall past circumstances to my memory i see clearly many things by retrospection which escaped unnoticed at the time and i am convinced that the impression was given and has been deepening from their very first interview  oh my louisa my child what a scene of difficulties is now opening upon thee what fury will thou have to encounter from my lord what malice what resentment from sir george now who shall prevent a mortal encounter between arundel and his rival  can you wonder if i fly from the world if i hide myself from these approaching terrors helpless as i am and alike incapable either to prevent them coming or meet them when they come no my good friend let me sink into oblivious solitude let me steer my feeble bark out of the stream of this overwhelming torrent may heaven direct preserve and bless my child may she be happy in the arms of arundel may i repose myself in secrecy and retirement  i have formed my plan and shall not lose a moment in preparing for it when i am arrived at the place of my destination i shall write to you but as i mean to keep it private from all but you even from my daughter herself and arundel above all i must conjure you in the most solemn manner never to divulge my secret  time may bring all things round if providence befriends my child and she is happy with her arundel then i will come forth and claim participation in the blessing if not death is my asylum i sink unnoticed into the forgetful grave  farewell end of the first volume
