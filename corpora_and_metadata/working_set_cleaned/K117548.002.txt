the connoisseur  by mr town critic and censorgeneral  vol ii   non de villis domibusve alienis nec male necne lepos saltet sed quod magis ad nos pertinet et nescire malum est agitamus hor london printed for r baldwin at the rose in paternoster row mdcclvi  the connoisseur by mr town critic and censorgeneral number lxxi thursday june        est brevitate opus ut currat sententia neu se impediat verbis lassas onerantibus aures et sermon opus est modo tristi saepe jocoso hor among the several degrees of authors there are none perhaps who have more obstacles to surmount at their setting out than the writers of periodical essays talk with a modern critic and he will tell you that to set up a new paper is a vain attempt after the inimitable spectators and others that the subjects are already preoccupied and that it is equally impossible to find out a new field for observation as to discover a new world with these prejudices the public are prepared to receive us and while they expect to be cloyed with the stale repetition of the same fare though tossed up in a different manner they have but little relish for the entertainment  that the spectator first led the way must undoubtedly be acknowledged but that his followers must for that reason be always supposed to tread in his steps can by no means be allowed in the high road of life there are several extensive walks as well as byepaths which we may strike into without the necessity of keeping the same beaten track with those that have gone before us new objects for ridicule will continually present themselves and even the same characters will appear different by being differently disposed as in the same pack of cards though ever so often shuffled there will never be two hands exactly alike  after this introduction i hope to be pardoned if i indulge myself in speaking a word or two concerning my own endeavors to entertain the public which i imagine i could never do with so good a grace as at the beginning of my second volume and first whatever objections the reader may have had to the subjects of my papers i shall make no apology for the manner in which i have chose to treat them the dread of falling into what they are pleased to call colloquial barbarisms has induced some unskilful writers to swell their bloated diction with uncouth phrases and the affected jargon of pedants for my own part i never go out of the common way of expression merely for the sake of introducing a more sounding word with a latin termination the english language is sufficiently copious and expressive without any further adoption of new terms and the native words seem to me to have far more force than any foreign auxiliaries however pompously ushered in as british soldiers fight our battles better than the troops taken into our pay  the subjects of my essays have been chiefly such as i thought might recommend themselves to the public notice by being new and uncommon for this reason i purposely avoided the worn out practice of retailing scraps of morality and affecting to dogmatize on the common duties of life in this point indeed the spectator is inimitable nor could i hope to say any thing new upon these topics after so many excellent moral and religious essays which are the principal ornament of his work i have therefore contented myself with exposing vice and folly by painting the actors in their natural colors without assuming the rigidness of a preacher or the moroseness of a philosopher i have oftener chose to undermine our fashionable excesses by secret sapping than to storm them by open assaults in a word upon all occasions i have endeavored to laugh people into a better behavior as i am convinced that the sting of reproof is not less sharp for being concealed and advice never comes with a better face than when it comes with a laughing one  there are some points in the course of this work which perhaps might have been treated of with a more serious air i have thought it my duty to take every opportunity of exposing the absurd tenets of our modern freethinkers and enthusiasts the enthusiast is indeed much more difficult to cure than the freethinker because the latter with all his bravery cannot but be conscious that he is wrong whereas the former has perhaps deceived himself into a belief that he is certainly in the right and the more he is opposed the more he considers himself as patiently suffering for the truths sake ignorance is too stubborn to yield to conviction and on the other hand those whom a little learning has made mad are too proud and selfsufficient to hearken to the sober voice of reason the only way left us therefore is to root out superstition by making its followers ashamed of themselves and as for our freethinkers it is but right to turn their boasted weapons of ridicule against them and as they themselves endeavor to banter all others out of their serious and virtuous notions we too in the language of the psalmist should laugh them to scorn and have them in derision  but whatever merit i may assume to myself from my writings i must at the same time confess myself indebted to several correspondents for many excellent pieces and more particularly to the gentlemen who have signed themselves a b and g k as i know not the real names of any of my correspondents i am not without some hopes that i have been honored by an earl or a right honorable at least for to say the truth i cannot at present apply to myself the known boast of terence  homines nobiles eum adjutare assidueque una scribere   it is with infinite pleasure that i find myself so much encouraged to continue my labors by the kind reception which they have hitherto met with from the public and mr baldwin with no less pleasure informs me that as there are but few numbers left of the present edition he intends to collect them into two pocket volumes the reader cannot conceive how much i already pride myself on the charming figure which my works will make in this new form and i shall endeavor to render these volumes as complete as i possibly can by several considerable additions and amendments though contracted into the small space of a twelves volume i still hope to maintain my former dignity like the devils in miltons pandaemonium who  to smallest forms reduced their shapes immense and were at large   the spectator has very elegantly compared his single papers as they came out to cherries on a stick of the dearness of which the purchasers cannot complain who are willing to gratify their taste with choice fruit at its earliest production i have considered my own papers as so many flowers which joined together would make up a pretty nosegay and though each of them singly taken may not be equally admired for their odours they may receive an additional fragrance by an happy union of their sweets  custom has lately introduced a new fashion among essaywriters of giving translations of the mottos for the benefit of the ladies but as denham has remarked of translation in general the spirit of the original is evaporated in the transfusion and nothing is left behind but a mere caput mortuum translations however must be given and it has been the usual way to copy them promiscuously from dryden or francis though they are generally very wide of the intended sense of the original and not unfrequently nothing to the purpose for this reason i design to give new translations or rather imitations of all the mottos and quotations adapted to the present times some of these will admit of epigrammatic turns and many of them will afford room for lively and picturesque allusions to modern manners in this dress they will at least appear more of a piece with the essays themselves and not like the patchwork of random translations  in the mean time i shall only add that if any nobleman gentleman or rich citizen is ambitious to have his name prefixed to either of these volumes he is desired to send in proposals together with a list of his virtues and good qualities to the publisher and the dedications shall be disposed of to the best bidder  none but principals will be treated with  the connoisseur by mr

possible are not content with laying out beautiful walks and providing an excellent band of music but are also at much expense to amuse us with the old english entertainment of balladsinging for this end they not only retain the best voices that can be procured but each of them also has a poet in ordinary who is allowed a stated salary and the run of the gardens the productions of these petty laureats naturally come within my notice as critic and indeed whether i am at vauxhall ranelagh marybone or even sadlers wells i indulge myself in many remarks on the poetry of the place and am as attentive to the songs as to the cascade the fireworks or miss isabella wilkinson  ballads seem peculiarly adapted to the genius of our people and are a species of composition in which we are superior to all other nations many of our old english songs have in them an affecting simplicity and it is remarkable that our best writers have not been ashamed to cultivate this branch of poetry cowley waller rofcommon row gay prior and many others have left behind them very elegant ballads but it must be confessed to the honor of the present age that it was reserved for our modern writers to bring this kind of poetry to perfection songwriting is now reduced to certain rules of art and the balladmaker goes to work by a method as regular and mechanical as a carpenter or a blacksmith  swift in his voyage to laputa describes a machine to write books in all arts and sciences i have also read of a mill to make verses and remember to have seen a curious table by the assistance of which the most illiterate might amuse themselves in composing hexameters and pentameters in latin inventions wonderfully calculated for the promotion of literature whatever gentlemen of grubstreet or others are ambitious to inlist themselves as hackney sonetteers are desired to attend to the following rules drawn from the practice of our modern songwriters a set of geniusses excellent in their manner and who will probably be hereafter as much known and admired as gardenpoets as the celebrated tailor is now famous under the denomination of waterpoet  i must beg leave possitively to contradict any reports insinuating that our balladmakers are in possession of such a machine mill or table as abovementioned and believe it to be equally false that it is their practice to hustle certain quaint terms and phrases together in a hat and take them out at random it has indeed been asserted on some just ground that their productions are totally void of sense and expression that they have little rhyme and less reason and that they are from beginning to end nothing more than nonsensical rhapsodies to a new tune this charge i do not mean to deny though i cannot but lament the deplorable want of taste that mentions it as a fault for it is this very circumstance which i who am professedly a connoisseur particularly admire it is a received maxim with all composers of music that nothing is so melodious as nonsense manly sense is too harsh and stubborn to go through the numberless divisions and subdivisions of modern music and to be trilled forth in crotchets and demiquavers for this reason thought is so cautiously sprinkled over a modern song which it is the business of the singer to warble into harmony and sentiment  our balladmakers for the most part slide into the familiar style and affect that easy manner of writing which according to wycherley is easily written seeing the dangerous consequence of meaning in words adapted to music they are very frugal of sentiment and indeed they husband it so well that the same thoughts are adapted to every song the only variation requisite in twenty ballads is that the last line of the stanza be different in this ingenious line the wit of the whole song consists and the author whether he shall die if he has not the lass of the mill or deserves to be reckoned an ass turns over his dictionary of rhymes for words of a similar sound and every verse jingles to the same word with all the agreeable variety of a set of bells eternally ringing the same peal  the authors of lovesongs formerly wasted a great deal of poetry in illustrating their own passion and the beauty of their mistress but our modern poets content themselves with falling in love with her name there cannot be a greater misfortune to one of these rhymers than a mistress with a hard name such a misfortune sends them all over the world and makes them run through all arts sciences and languages for correspondent terms and after all perhaps the name is so harsh and untractable that our poet has as much difficulty to bring it into verse as the celebraters of the duke of marlborough were puzzled to reduce to rhyme the uncouth names of the dutch towns taken in queen annes wars valentine in love for love when he talks of turning poet orders jeremy to get the maids together of an evening to crambo no contemptible hint to our balladmakers and which if properly made use of would be of as much service to them as byshes art of poetry  fearing lest this method of songwriting should one day grow obsolete in order to preserve to posterity some idea of it i have put together the following dialogue as a specimen of the modern manner i must however be ingenuous enough to confess that i can claim no farther merit in this elegant piece than that of a compiler it is a canto from our most celebrated new songs from which i have carefully culled all the sweetest flowers of poetry and bound them up together for the delight and wonder of the world as all the lines are taken from different songs set to different tunes i would humbly propose that this curious performance should be sung jointly by all the best voices in the manner of a dutch concert where every man sings his own tune i had once some thoughts of affixing marginal references to each line to inform the reader by note at what place the song whence it is taken was first sung but i shall spare myself that trouble by desiring the reader to look on the whole piece as arising from a coalition of our most eminent songwriters at vauxhall ranelagh marybone and sadlers wells assuring him that this short dialogue contains the pith and marrow or rather to borrow an expression from the fine lady in lethe the quinsetence and emptity of all our modern songs  a pastoral dialogue between corydon and sarah sar ah whither so fast would my corydon go step in you have nothing else to do cor they say i am in love but i answer no no so i wish i may die if i do once my heart played a tune that went pity

secernere sacra profanis hor walking the other day in westminster abbey among the many oftentatious monuments erected to kings and warriors i could not help observing a little stone on which was this pompous inscription  aeternae memoriae sacrum  sacred to the eternal memory of  the name of the person to whom immortality was thus secured is almost obliterated and perhaps when alive he was little known and as soon forgot by the small circle of his friends and acquaintance  i have been used to look upon epitaphs as a kind of flattering dedications to the dead in which is set down a long catalogue of virtues that nobody knew they were possessed of while living and not a word of their vices or follies the veracity of these posthumous encomiums may indeed be fairly suspected as we are generally told that the disconsolate widow or weeping son erected the monument in testimony of their affliction for the loss of the kindest husband or most affectionate father but what dowager who gets a comfortable jointure by her good mans decease would refuse to set her hand to it on his tombstone that he was the best of husbands though perhaps they had parted beds or what heir would be so base and ungrateful as not to give a few good words to a crabbed parent after his death in return for his estate  by the extravagant praises which are indiscriminately lavished on the ashes of every person alike we entirely pervert the original intent of epitaphs which were contrived to do honor and justice to the virtuous and the good but by the present practice the reputations of men are equally confounded with their dust in the grave where there is no distinction between the good and the bad the law has appointed searchers to enquire when any one dies into the cause of his death in the same manner i could wish that searchers were appointed to examine into his way of living before a character be given of him upon the tombstone  the flatteries that are paid to the deceased are undoubtedly owing to the pride of their survivors which is the same among the lowest as the highest set of people when an obscure grocer or tallowchandler dies at his lodgings at islington the newspapers are stuffed with the same parade of his virtues and good qualities as when a duke goes out of the world and the petty overseer of a little hamlet has a painted board with the initials of his name stuck up at the end of his wickerd turf while the noblemen reposes under a grand mausoleum erected to his memory with a long list of his titles and heroic deeds  the great indeed have found means to separate themselves even in their graves from the vulgar by having their ashes deposited in churches and cathedrals and covered by the most superb monuments in my late visit to westminster abbey i could not but remark the difference of taste which has prevailed in setting up these edifices for the dead in former times we find that they were content to clap up the bust or statue of the deceased set round perhaps with the emblems of his merits his employment or station of life if any person was remarkable for his virtue and piety it was pointed out by two or three little chubbyfaced cherubims who were crying for his death or holding a crown over his head the warrior was spread along at full length in a complete suit of armor with the trophies of war hung round about him and the bishop was laid flat upon his back with his coifed head resting on a stone bible and his hands joined together in the posture of praying  if socrates or any other of the ancient philosophers could revive again and be admitted into westminster abbey he would be induced to fancy himself in a pantheon of the heathen gods the modern taste not content with introducing roman temples into our churches and representing the virtues under allegorical images has ransacked all the fabulous accounts of the heathen theology to strike out new embellishments for our christian monuments we are not in the least surprised to see mercury attending the tomb of an orator and pallas or hercules supporting that of a warrior milton has been blamed for his frequent allusions to the heathen theology in his sacred poem but surely we are more to be condemned for admitting the whole class of their fictitious deities into the house of god itself  if there is not a stop put to this taste we may soon expect to see our churches instead of being dedicated to the service of religion set apart for the reception of the heathen gods a deceased admiral will be represented like neptune with a trident in his hand drawn in a shell by dolphins preceded by tritons and followed by nereids lashing the marble waves with their tails a general will be habited like mars bearing an helmet and spear in polished stone and a celebrated toast will be stuck up naked like the venus de medicis cut in alabaster  it has been proposed on a different account to have a separate place distinct from our churches for the reception of our monuments i could wish to see such a scheme put in execution for the present absurd mixture of the several objects of pagan and christian belief as represented on the tombs lately set up in compliance of the modern taste must be shocking to every serious beholder our pious forefathers were content with exhibiting to us the usual emblems of death the hourglass the skull and the crossmarrowbones but these are not sufficient for our present more refined age the three fatal sisters mentioned in the heathen mythology must be introduced spinning drawing and cutting the thread of life could one of the last century see a winged figure blowing a trumpet on the top of a modern monument he would be apt to mistake it for an archangel and be naturally put in mind of that awful time when the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall rise but the design we are told is very different and this winged messenger is no other than the ancient personage of fame who is proclaiming the virtues of the defunct round the world  should any one propose to take down from st pauls cathedral those paintings of sir james thornhill representing the transactions of st paul and in their place to set up titians pictures of the amors of the heathen gods and goddesses every one would be shocked at the impiety of the proposal nor is the fashion of introducing heathen deities into our monuments much less absurd for while any of those are suffered to remain in our churches the reproof of our savior concerning the temple at jerusalem may perhaps become applicable to the present times  my house is an house of prayer but ye have made it a den of thieves  i hope i shall not be thought too grave or whimsical if i earnestly recommend it to the consideration of those whom it may concern whether a reformation is not necessary in our churches to purge them from these profane images which though not the objects of our idolatry have no more pretense to be set up in the temple of the living lord than those of the canonized saints of the roman catholics  modern taste is continually striking out new improvements we may therefore conclude that when our statuaries have traveled through the ancient pantheon and exhausted all the subjects of the grecian and roman mythology we shall have recourse to the superstitions of other nations for the designs of our monuments they will then probably be adorned with egyptian hieroglyphics and the tomb of some future hero may be built according to the model of the prophets tomb at mecca it is not to be doubted but that the chinese taste which has been already introduced into our gardens our buildings and our furniture will also soon find its way into our churches and how elegant must a monument appear which is erected in the chinese taste and embellished with dragons bells pagods and mandarins  the connoisseur by mr town critic and censorgeneral number lxxiv thursday june          non ita romuli praescriptum et intonsi catonis auspiciis veterumque norma hor there is no method of reproof more in vogue than the drawing invidious parallels between the present times and the past the grumbling politician rails over his coffee at the present ministry and reminds you with a sigh of the golden days of queen bess while in matters of less consequence the critic shakes his head at mr town and mentions bickerstaff but the moralists are above all others devoted to this practice these wise gentlemen are continually looking backwards and condemning what lays immediately before them by retrospect they are for ever harping on this jarring chord and have scarce more words in their mouths than the solemn sentences said to be delivered by friar bacons brazen head time is  time was  time is past  no comparisons of this sort are so frequently repeated and so much insisted on as those drawn between the ancients and moderns if an eloquent member of the house of commons is cruelly suspected of bellowing for a place nothing rings in his ears but tully and demosthenes if a gentleman or perhaps a nobleman with a heavy mortgage on his estate disencumbers it by selling his interest at a county election he is immediately upbraided with one roman that was not ashamed to follow the ploughtail and another who could refuse large bribes and content himself with a cottage and turnips if a lady makes an unfortunate slip she is told again and again of lucretia and fifty other schoolboy tales of honor and chastity in a word there is not one fashionable frailty but has some stubborn antiquated virtue set in opposition to it and our unhappy metropolis is every day threatened with destruction for its degeneracy from the rigid maxims of rome or sparta  in the midst of all these severe reflections it gives me infinite pleasure that i can with justice take notice of the incontestable superiority of the moderns in point of modesty the arrogance of the ancients was so remarkable that in their idea of a perfect character they included every public and private virtue they aimed at a strict observance of all the duties of life and if some old romans had been styled gods while living it would not have been such gross flattery as was afterward practiced in honoring the emperors with an apotheosis their inflexible honesty was their perpetual boast and their virtue was their pride this high idea of a perfect character among the ancients naturally urged them to lift themselves to an invidious superiority above the rest of the world while the modest moderns by taking all the vices instead of the virtues into their notion of a fine gentleman endeavor to let themselves down to a level with the lowest of their species and have laid the surest foundation for humility fine gentlemen are so far from being proud that they are never guilty of any thing which gives them the least reason to be so and our fine ladies have none of the disgusting haughtiness of virtue though indeed they are seldom known to be ashamed  it is impossible to devise one method of lowering the good opinion a man might possibly conceive of himself that has not been put in practice no fine gentleman ever aimed at acquiring any excellence and if any natural perfections might give some little occasion for pride the greatest pains have been taken to destroy them good parts have been often drowned in drunkenness and a strong constitution sweated away in bagnios and in the mean time learning has been totally neglected lest improvement should bring on pedantry and literary pride the most shining parts in the character of a fine gentleman are that he drinks deep dresses genteelly rides well can shoe his own horse and is possessed of some few other qualifications which nobody can ever suspect a mind the least given to ambition would ever labor to acquire for my part i am so far from agreeing with our famous satirist that love of fame is the universal passion that when i observe the behavior of our fine gentlemen i am apt to think it proceeds from the lowest and humblest turn of mind indeed their singular modesty appears to me the only means of accounting for their actions which commonly tend to place them in the meanest and most contemptible light  nothing but this invincible modesty and fear of seeming to aim at excellence could ever give rise to certain habits not only ridiculous but ungraceful good eyes for instance are universally acknowledged to give luster to the whole countenance yet fashion and humility have blinded the whole town the beau draws his eyes out of his pocket and the beauties kill us through spyingglasses it has been known to be the vogue for persons of fashion to lose the use of their legs and limp along as if they were crippled this practice i daily expect to be revived for i take it for granted that the tall staves now carried about must naturally dwindle into crutches an inarticulate lisp even now infects the delivery in polite conversation it is not at all unfashionable to pretend deafness and unless the ladies object to it i do not despair of seeing the time when the whole modish world shall affect to be dumb  this humble way of thinking has been carried so far that it has even introduced a new species of hypocrisy fine gentlemen fearing lest their good qualities should in their own despite overbalance their bad ones claim several vices to which they have no title there is something very admirable and ingenuous in this disposition among our young people who not only heartily discover all their frailties but accuse themselves of faults which they never intended to commit i know a young fellow who is almost every morning complaining of the headache and cursing the last nights champagne at the st albans when i am well assured he passed his evening very soberly with his maiden aunts in cheapside i am also acquainted with another gentleman who is very fond of confessing his intrigues and often modestly takes shame to himself for the great mischief he does among the women though i well know he is too bashful even to make love to his laundress he sometimes laments publicly the unlucky consequences of an amor and has more than once been discovered to send pillboxes and gallipots directed for himself to be left at the bar of neighboring coffeehouses the same humble turn of mind induces the frugal to appear extravagant and makes many a religious young fellow deny his principles brave his conscience and affect the character and conversation of an atheist to say the truth the generality of the gay world are arrant hypocrites in their vices and appear to be worse than they really are many of our pretended bloods are in fact no more drunkards whoremasters or infidels than a bully is a man of courage and are as sincere in their boasts of vice as statesmen or beauties in their mutual professions of friendship  that part of the female world which composes the order of fine ladies have as much humility as their counterparts the fine gentlemen there is something so charming in the fair sex that we should almost adore them if they did not lay aside all the pride of reputation and by some goodnatured familiarities reduce themselves to an equality with us it is indeed wonderful to see with what diligence our polite ladies pare off the excellencies from their characters when we see them almost as naked as the graces it is natural to suppose them as warmly devoted to venus and when we hear them talk loosely and encourage double meanings in conversation we are apt to imagine their notions of honor not very strict or severe but after all this is frequently mere hypocrisy and the effect of humility many a lady very wanton in appearance is in reality very modest and many a coquet has lost her reputation without losing her virtue i make no doubt but that several ladies of suspicious characters are not so bad as they seem and that there are honorable persons among the gayest of our women of quality  to return whence i see set out the extraordinary modesty of the moderns so averse to the arrogant pride of the ancients claiming all virtues and good qualities whatsoever is the only key to their behavior thus vice or at least the appearance of vice becomes absolutely requisite to pass through the world with tolerable decency and the character of a man of spirit as sir john brute says they were sneaking dogs and afraid of being damned in those days but we are better informed and fear nothing but the appearance of too much virtue to secure the nobility gentry and others from so shocking an imputation i shall speedily present the world with a curious piece compiled from the practice and principles of the present times entitled a new treatise on ethics or a system of immoral philosophy in this treatise i have treated at large of modern modesty shown the excellence and utility of immorality and considered drinking whoring fighting and gaming as the four cardinal vices or in other words the principal constituents of bucks bloods and fine gentlemen  the connoisseur by mr town critic and censorgeneral number lxxv thursday july        non tu corpus eras sine pectore  hor goodnature is to the mind what beauty is to the body and an agreeable disposition creates a love and esteem for us in the rest of mankind as an handsome person recommends us to the good graces of the fairsex to say the truth any little defect in point of figure is sooner overlooked than a sourness in the temper and we conceive a more lasting disgust at a morose churlishness of manners than at a humpback or a pair of bandy legs goodnature is indeed so amiable a qualification that every man would be thought to possess it and the ladies themselves would no more like to be accused of a perverse turn of mind than of an unhappy cast of features hence it proceeds that those unfortunate stale virgins usually called old maids have both these heavy censures thrown upon them and are at once condemned as ugly and illnatured  some persons are according to the strict import of the phrase itself born goodnatured these fortunate people are easy in themselves and agreeable to all about them they are as it were constitutionally pleasing and can no more fail of being affable and engaging in conversation than a hamilton or a coventry can be otherwise than beautiful and charming yet it is the duty even of these who are naturally endowed with the soft parts of conversation to be careful not to deprave or abuse them they must not rely too confidently on their native agreeableness of temper for we should no more esteem a man who discovered a negligence of pleasing than we should admire a beauty who was an intolerable slattern nor on the other hand should they let their goodnature run to an excess of compliment and extravagant civility for an engaging temper has been as often spoiled by this troublesome politeness as a fine shape has been squeezed into frightful distortions by bad stays and a fine complexion entirely ruined by paint  but if this care is requisite even in those few who are blessed with this native complacency and good humor how necessary is it for the generality of mankind to labor at rectifying the irregularities in their temper for this purpose it would be fully sufficient if they would employ half the art to cultivate their minds that is daily made use of to set off their persons to this important end not only the female delicacies of paint and essence are called in as auxiliaries to the embroidered suits and french perukes but this anxiety to supply any personal defect has set the invention of artificers to work with so much earnestness that there is scarce any external blemish which may not be removed or concealed and however unkindly nature may have dealt with you you may by their assistance be made a model for a statuary or a pattern for a painter to study if you want an inch in height your shoemaker can supply it and your hosier can furnish you with a pair of calves that may put an irishman to the blush an irregularity in your shape can be made invisible by your tailor or at least by the artist near the haymarket who daily gives notice that he makes steel stays for all those who are inclined to be crooked there are various compounds and cosmetics that will cure spots and freckles in the complexion and combs and ointments that will change red hair to the finest brown do you want an eye tailor will fill the vacant socket with as bright a piercer as the family of the pentweazles can boast or is your mouth deficient for want of teeth paul jullion to use his own phrase will rectify your head and fix a set in your gums as even and beautiful as ever adorned the mouth of a chimneysweeper these and many other inventions as curious and extraordinary have been devised and there are no operations however painful which have not been submitted to with patience to conquer personal deformities i know a gentleman who went through the agony of having his leg broke a second time because it had been set awry and i remember a lady who died of a cancer in her breast occasioned by the application of repelling plasters to keep back her milk that the beauty of her neck might not be destroyed i most heartily wish the same resolution was discovered in improving the disposition half the care that is taken of the body would have happy effects upon the temper tully in that part of his offices where he speaks of grace tells us that it is destroyed by any violent perturbations either of the body or mind it is a pity that mankind cannot be reconciled to this opinion since it is likely they would spare no pains in cultivating their minds if it tended to adorn their persons yet it is certain that a man makes a worse figure with an ignorant pate than an unpowdered peruke and that knowledge is a greater ornament to the head than a bag or a smart cocked hat that anger sets like a bloodshot in the eyes while goodnature lights them up with smiles and makes every feature in the face charming and agreeable there is a certain sweetness of disposition which is sure to procure to those who possess it the good will of their acquaintance but it is as ridiculous for a man to hope to be beloved while he neglects to be amiable as it would be in a lady who expects a multitude of admirers to appear always in a dirty dishabille  the difficulty of being convinced that we want this social turn is the grand reason that so little pains are taken to acquire and perfect it would a man once be persuaded of any irregularity in his temper he would find the blemishes of the mind more easily corrected and amended than the defects and deformities of the body but alas every man is in his own opinion sensible and goodhumored it is indeed possible to convince us that we have a bad complexion or an awkward deportment which we endeavor to amend by washes and a dancing master but when the mind is in fault selfadulation the most fatal species of flattery makes us cajole ourselves into a belief that the fault is not in our own disposition but in that of our companions as the mad inhabitants of moorfields conclude all that come to visit them out of their senses a whimsical person complains of the perverseness of his acquaintance and constantly accuses them of fancy and caprice and there never was an instance of a positive untoward man that did not continually rail at the stubbornness and obstinacy of the rest of the world a modern buck damns you for a sullen fellow if you refuse a pint bumper and looks upon you as a sneaking scoundrel if you decline entering into any of his wild pranks and do not choose to lay all night in the roundhouse it was the saying of an old philosopher that the eye sees not itself but when this blind partiality is carried so far as to make us think those guilty of the folly who make us sensible of it it is surely as absurd as to imagine that the hairlip or carbuncled nose a man sees in the glass belongs to the figure in the mirror and not to his own face this foolish flattery it is that makes us think ourselves inflexibly right while we are obstinately wrong and prevents our receiving or communicating any pleasure in society the untractable humourist while he disgusts all that are about him conceives himself to be the person affronted and laments that there is no harmony in the conversation though he is himself the only one out of tune  perfection is no more to be expected in the minds of men than in their persons natural defects and irregularities in both must be overlooked and excused all i desire at present is that they would endeavor with equal earnestness to cultivate their minds as they do to adorn their persons to this end we should examine ourselves impartially and not erect ourselves into judges and treat all the rest of mankind like criminals would it not be mighty ridiculous in a person of quality to go to court in a ruff a cloak a pair of trunk breeches and the habit worn in the days of queen elizabeth and while he strutted about in this antiquated garb to accuse all the rest of the world of being out of the fashion as we are composed of a body and mind equal attention should be paid to both and we should not be anxious to cloth the person and at the same time let the mind go naked we should be equally assiduous to obtain knowledge and virtue as to put on lace and velvet and when our minds are completely dressed we should take care that goodnature and complacency influence and direct the whole which will throw the same grace over our virtues and good qualities as fine clothes receive from being cut according to the fashion  i cannot conclude better than with a passage from swifts tale of a tub where the strict analogy between the clothing of the mind and the body is humourously pointed out man says he is a microcoat as to his body there can be no doubt but examine even the acquirements of his mind you will find them all contribute in their order toward furnishing out an exact dress to instance no more is not religion a cloak honesty a pair of shoes worn out in the dirt selflove a surtout vanity a shirt and conscience a pair of breeches which though a cover for lewdness as well as nastiness is easily slipped down for the service of both  the connoisseur by mr town critic and censorgeneral number lxxvi

of our ballad singers who are endeavoring like tyrtaeus of old to rouse their fellow countrymen to battle while all the polite world are hurrying to portsmouth to see mockfights and be regaled on

the lie of the day is artfully contrived to influence the rise and fall of the moneybarometer in changealley this is the present state of politics within the bills of mortality of which i shall now take no further notice but submit to the perusal of my readers the following letter from my cousin village on the same important subject  to mr town  june  0      dear cousin war though it has not laid our fields waste or made our cities desolate engrosses almost all the attention of this place every farmhouse swarms with politicians who lay their wise heads together for the good of the nation and at every petty chandlers shop in town while the half quarterns of tea are weighed out the balance of europe is adjusted the preparations now making by sea and land are as popular subjects as the price of hay or the broadwheelact success to our noble admirals and a speedy war are also as common toasts over a mug of ale as a good harvest though it must be owned that some selfish farmers who have not an equal share of public spirit and love of their country with their fellow rustics are somewhat apprehensive of the influence which a war may have upon the land tax  i am at present on a visit to sir politic hearty who is one of those country gentlemen that are continually athirst for news and are more anxious about the affairs of the nation than the care of their own estates sir politic is miserable three days in the week for want of fresh intelligence but his spirits revive at the sound of the posthorn when the mail brings him the lomdon evening post and a long letter of news from his nephew at the temple these sir politic himself reads after dinner to me the curate of the parish and the townapothecary whom he indulges with the run of his table for their deep insight into the proceedings of the government he makes many shrewd remarks on every paragraph and frequently takes the opinion of the two doctors for he honors both the curate and apothecary with that title on the asterisks dashes and italics he has also discovered several mysteries in his majestys visit to hanover has elected a king of the romans and laid a better plan for discharging the national debt than has ever yet been proposed by jacob henriques many of his reflections have given me great entertainment but i was never more diverted than at the following droll incident at one of our late privy councils sir politics nephew who it seems has made as great a proficiency in the study of the humbug as of the law sent him down as a serious prophecy a new pamphlet humourously foretelling the destruction of the french from ezekiel this the unsuspicious baronet read very gravely over and then turning to the curate cried out rare news doctor  come fill a bumper to old england  we have the bible of our side you see and hark ye doctor i would advise you as a friend to preach a sermon upon thou shall be desolate o mount seir  nothing at first puzzled the honest baronet and the rest of our country politicians so much as the new seat of war they were pretty tollerably acquainted with brussels ghent antwerp and the other scenes of action in flanders but virginia the ohio the lake ontario etc to use a common phrase were quite out of their latitude this difficulty was however at length surmounted by the templars transmitting to his uncle one of d anvilles maps which has enabled the baronet sometimes to delineate the progress of the french up the ohio in meanders of port winding along the table and sometimes to demolish the forts lately raised by the enemy behind pensylvania and at crown point sir politic has indeed studied monsieur d anville very thoroughly and i dare say is better acquainted with his plan of north america than with the map of his own estate  war never fails of producing several groundless and contradictory reports but if fame is a lying jade in town she is the idlest gossip that ever spoke in the country it is impossible for you cousin or any of your readers who reside constantly in london to form any tolerable idea of a country newspaper there is in this town a petty printer who sets his press to work once a week by publishing a journal which contains advices more extraordinary if not authentic than the gazette it has been his custom for some years past to raise apparitions in country churches to give accounts of battles fought in the air comets and several other preternatural phoenomena but since the rumor of a war he has dealt in nothing but skirmishes and engagements he gave the french fleet several furious broadsides before it sailed from breast and has gained us several victories in virginia though in his last journal he shot off both boscawens legs and made him fight like witherington on his stumps and it was but yesterday that sir politic on the authority of a letter from his nephew confuted this intelligence and set the admiral on his legs again  this cousin is the present state of politics at  which i think in the style of our newspapers might cause you much speculation you would be of great service if you could persuade our country statesmen that they would be better employed at their rustic occupations than in managing the affairs of the nation and that many a man would make a scurvy figure at the helm of the state who is of great use at the ploughtail as to my friend sir politic i should be very glad if he would leave the conduct of the war and the destination of our fleets and armies to the ministry who will i doubt not adjust matters as prudently as himself the curate and apothecary and i think his thoughts might be more properly exercised in contriving some method of redeeming two heavy mortgages that incumber his estate than in laying plans for the discharge of the national debt   the connoisseur by mr town critic and censorgeneral number lxxvii thursday july         cum pulchris tunicis sumet nova consilia et spes hor to mr town july         sir i read your late paper showing the close analogy which clothing the body bears to adorning the mind with great attention and am thoroughly persuaded that the generality of mankind would be as glad to embellish their minds as to set off their persons if they could procure knowledge virtue and goodnature with the same ease that they can furnish themselves with the ornaments of the body the clown in rug or duffel can at a moments warning be furnished with a complete suit of lace or embroidery from monmouthstreet his long lank greasy hair may be exchanged in middle row for a smart bag or a jemmy scratch and his clouted shoes with the rough hobnails in the heel and sole clumping at every step may be transformed into a pair of dancing pumps at the yorkshire warehouse or the old crispin in cranbourn alley the draggled street walker can rig herself with a clean smock a linen gown and a hat smartly cocked up behind and before in broad st giless or if she can afford it every pawnbroker will let out a gold watch with coronets a tissue or brocaded sack and all the paraphernalia of a countess but where mr town can these people go to cloth their minds or at what shops are retailed sense and virtue honor and honesty are not to be purchased in monmouthstreet knowledge is not infused into the head through the powderpuff and as good wine needs no bush sense is not derived from the fullbottomed periwig the woman of the town vamped up for show with paint patches plumpers and every external ornament that art can suggest knows no method to beautify her mind she cannot for any price buy chastity in broad st giless or hire honesty from the pawnbrokers  seeing therefore at one view the difficulty in obtaining the accomplishments of the mind and the exact analogy they bear to dress i have been laboring this week past to remedy that inconvenience and have at length devised a scheme which will fully answer that purpose in a word then i shall next winter open a shop or warehouse in the most public part of the town under the name of a mindand bodyclothier two trades which though never yet united are so far from being incompatible that they are in their nature inseparable i shall not only supply my friends with a suit or a single virtue but furnish them with complete habits of mind and body from head to foot and by a certain secret art in the form and texture of the things sold the required virtues shall be as inherent in them as the materials of which they are composed that such virtues may be transfused by clothes is evident from experience in the narrow extent of my reading mr town i remember to have met with an account of fortunatuss wishingcap by which he could transport himself in an instant from one place to another it is also well known that the famous jack the giantkiller possessed a sword of sharpness shoes of swiftness and a coat of invisibility why then may not i sell a suit of patriotism a sword of honor and retail modesty and chastity to fine ladies in tuckers and aprons my scheme is already in great forwardness and i shall be able to accommodate my customers by the next birthday wherefore as messieurs paris and others daily advertise in the newspapers i also choose to give the world public notice of my scheme and shall be proud to see them first apprised of it by means of your paper  no one who duly considers the natural influence which clothes commonly have upon their wearers will object to my scheme as utterly impracticable that a person can put on or throw off the internal habits of his mind together with his coat or his perriwig is plain in very numerous instances the young counselor who every morning in term time takes the measure of westminster hall with the importance of a judge upon the circuit at once divests himself of his gravity with the starched band and long robe and resumes the spirit of a buck together with the sword and bagwig in the same manner the orthodox vicar once a week wraps himself up in piety and virtue with his canonicals which qualities are as easily cast off again as his surplice and for the rest of the week he wears the dress as well as the manners of his foxhunting patron we may learn the disposition of a man by his apparel as we know the trade of a carpenter by his leathern apron or a soldier by his red coat when we see a snuffcoloured suit of ditto with the bolus buttons a metal headed cane and an enormous bushy grizzle we as readily know the wearer to be a dispenser of life and death as if we had seen him pounding a mortar or brandishing a clysterpipe the different affections of the mind have been distinguished by different colors as scarlet has been made to represent valor yellow to denote jealousy and true blue to signify integrity but we may likewise discover all the virtues and vices lurking in the different parts of the apparel when at a city feast i see the guests tucking their napkins into their shirtcollars as if they were all of them going to be shaved i very well know that their thoughts wear a different dress than in the alley and when the antiquated toast is laying on her complexion at the toilette and repairing the ruins of beauty what is she doing but patching her mind with pride and conceit in a word i can discover impudence staring from the bold cock of a kevenhuller frugality skulking in a darned stocking coquetry spread out in a hooppetticoat and soppery dangling from a shoulderknot i often please myself with thus remarking the various dresses of the mind and by the clue you have already given us i have been able to unfold the inmost linings of the heart and discover the very stuff of the thoughts  it must however be owned that in these matters the nicest penetration may be imposed on since in the present random method of dressing many persons appear in masquerade this inconvenience among many others will be remedied by my project for as whoever deals with me will at once cloth his mind and his body the whole town will be dressed in character thus if a chimneysweeper or a ploughboy put on a suit of embroidery a sword bagwig etc they will at the same time invest themselves with the internal dignity of a person of quality my ladys youngest son may buy courage with his regimentals and orthodoxy may be purchased at the same time with a gown and cassock by the young smarts from the universities my scheme also further recommends itself by laying open the only path to virtue and knowledge that the world will choose to follow and as my clothes will always be cut according to the newest and most elegant manner these qualifications of the mind inherent in them must necessarily come into fashion thus our fine gentlemen will learn morality under their valet de chamber and a young lady of fashion will acquire new accomplishments with every new ribband and become virtuous as well as beautiful at her toilette i depend on your readiness to promote my scheme but what i most earnestly entreat of you mr town is to use your utmost interest with the polite world but especially with the ladies not to discard clothes entirely as by such a resolution my scheme must be defeated and indeed it will not be in the power of man to give them virtue if they determine to go naked  as knowledge and virtue can never be sufficiently diffused my warehouse will be calculated for general use and stored with large assortments of all kinds of virtues and dresses that i may suit persons of whatever denomination physicians may be furnished from my shop with gravity and learning in the ties of a perriwig sergeants at law may be fitted with a competent knowledge of reports under a coif and young counselors may be endued with a sufficient fund of eloquence for the circuits in a smart tie between a bob and a flow contrived to cover a toupee i shall sell religion to country parsons in puddingsleeves and to young town curates just come from the university in doctors scarfs and cut grizzles i shall have some pious ejaculations whinings and groans ready cut out in leathern aprons and blue frocks for the preaching fraternity of carpenters bricklayers tallowchandlers and butchers at the tabernacle and foundery in moorfields for our military gentlemen designed to go abroad i shall have several parcels of true british courage woven in a variety of cockades and swordknots and for our fine gentlemen who stay at home i have provided a proper quantity of french bagatelle in cut velvet lace and embroidery neat as imported  as the ladies i suppose will all of them to a woman be desirous of purchasing beauty with every branch of the female apparel i am afraid i shall not be able to answer their demands but i shall have several dresses which will make up for the want of it i shall have neatness done up in a great variety of plain linen decency and discretion in several patterns for mobs hoods and nightgowns together with modesty disposed into tuckers kerchiefs for the neck stays that almost meet the chin and petticoats that touch the ground i shall also have a small portion of chastity knit into garters and laces for the stays very proper to be worn at masquerades and assemblies  i had almost forgot to mention that authors who are often in equal want of sense and clothes shall be fitted out by me with both at once on very reasonable rates as for yourself mr town i shall beg leave to present you with an entire suit of superfine wit and humor warranted to wear well and appear creditable and in which no author would be ashamed to be seen  i am sir your humble servant eutrapelus trim   the connoisseur by mr town critic and censorgeneral number lxxviii thursday july         a very uncommon though just vein of thought runs through the following letter i shall add nothing more in recommendation of it but only assure my correspondent that i shall be very glad to hear from him again  aetatis cujusque notandi sunt tibi mores hor to mr town sir nothing appears to me to be more necessary in order to wear off any particularities in our behavior or to root out any perverseness in our opinions than mixing with persons of ages and occupations different from our own whosoever confines himself entirely to the society of those who are engaged in the same persuits and whose thoughts naturally take the same turn with his own acquires a certain stiffness and pedantry of behavior which is sure to make him disagreeable except in one particular set of company instead of cramping the mind by keeping it within so narrow a circle we should endeavor to enlarge it by every worthy notion and accomplishment and temper each qualification with its opposite as the four elements are compounded in our natural frame  the necessity of this free conversation to open and improve the mind is evident from the consequences which always follow a neglect of it the employment each man follows wholly engrosses his attention and tinges the mind with a peculiar die which shows itself in all the operations of it unless prevented by natural good sense and liberal education the physician the lawyer and the tradesman will appear in company though none of those occupations are the subject of discourse and the clergyman will grow morose and severe who seldom or never converses with the laity but if no particular profession has this influence over us some darling passion or amusement gives a color to our thoughts and actions and makes us odious or at least ridiculous fine ladies for instance by despising the conversation of sensible men can talk of nothing but routes balls assemblies birthday suits and intrigues and fine gentlemen for the same reason of almost nothing at all in like manner the furious partizan who has not been weaned from a mad attachment to particular principles is weak enough to imagine every man of a different way of thinking a fool and a scoundrel and the sectary or zealot devotes to eternal damnation all those who will not go to heaven in the same road with himself under the guidance of whitefield wesley or count zinzendorff to the same cause we owe the rough country squire whose ideas are wholly bent on guns dogs horses and game and who has every thing about him of a piece with his diversions his hall must be adorned with stags heads instead of busts and statues and in the room of family pictures you will see prints of the most famous stallions and racehorses all his doors open and shut with foxes feet and even the buttons of his clothes are impressed with the figures of dogs foxes stags and horses to this absurd practice of cultivating only one set of ideas and shutting ourselves out from any intercourse with the rest of the world is owing that narrowness of mind which has infected the conversations of the polite world with insipidity made roughness and brutality the characteristics of a mere country gentleman and produced the most fatal consequences in politics and religion  but if this commerce with the generality of mankind is so necessary to remove any impressions which we may be liable to receive from any particular employment or darling amusement what precautions ought to be used in order to remedy the inconveniences naturally brought on us by the different ages of life it is not certain that a person will be engaged in any profession or given up to any peculiar kind of pleasure but the mind of every man is subject to the inclinations arising from the several stages of his existence as well as his body to chronical distempers this indeed mr town is the principal cause of my writing to you for it has often given me great concern to see the present division between the young and the old to observe elderly men forming themselves into clubs and societies that they may be more securely separated from youth and to see young men running into dissipation and debauchery rather than associate with age if each party would labor to conform to the other from such a coalition many advantages would accrue to both our youth would be instructed by the experience of age and lose much of that severity which they retain too long while at the same time the wrinkled brow of the aged would be smoothed by the sprightly cheerfulness of youth by which they might supply the want of spirits forget the loss of old friends and bear with ease all their worldly misfortunes it is remarkable that those young men are the most worthy and sensible who have kept up any intercourse with the old and that those old men are of the most cheerful and amiable disposition who have not been ashamed to converse with the young  i will not pretend to decide which party is most blameable in neglecting this necessary commerce between each other which if properly managed would be at once so beneficial and delightful but it undoubtedly arises from a certain selfishness and obstinacy in both which will not suffer them to make a mutual allowance for the natural difference of their dispositions their inclinations are indeed as different as their years yet each expects the other to comply though neither will make any advances how rarely do we see the least degree of society preserved between a father and son a shocking reflection when we consider that nature has endeavored to unite them by parental affection on one side and filial gratitude on the other yet a father and son as seldom live together with any tolerable harmony as a husband and wife and chiefly for the same reason for though they are both joined under the same yoke yet they are each tugging different ways a father might as well expect his son to be as gouty and infirm as himself as to have the disposition which he has contracted from age and a son might as reasonably desire the vigor and vivacity of five and twenty as his own love of gaiety and diversions in his father it is therefore plainly evident that a mutual endeavor of conforming to each other is absolutely requisite to keep together the cement of natural affection which the want of it so frequently dissolves or at at least if it does not disturb the affection it constantly destroys the society between father and son  this unhappy and unnatural division is often the subject of complaint in persons of both ages but is still unremedied because they neither reflect on the cause whence it proceeds old men are perpetually commenting on the extreme levity of the times and blaming the young because they do not admire and court their company which indeed is no wonder since they generally treat their youthful companions as mere children and expect such a slavish deference to their years as destoys that equality by which cheerfulness and society subsists young men do not like to be chid by an illnatured proverb or reproved by a wrinkle but though they do not choose to be corrected by their grave seniors like schoolboys they would be proud to consult them as friends which the injudicious severity of old age seldom will permit not deigning to indulge them with so great a degree of freedom and familiarity youth on the other hand shun the company of age complaining of the small regard and respect paid to them though they often act with so little reserve and such unbecoming confidence as not to deserve it suppose the old were pleased with the natural flow of spirits and lively conversation of youth still some respect may be challenged as due to them nor should the decency and sobriety of their characters ever be insulted by any improper or immodest conversation  i am an old man myself mr town and i have an only boy whose behavior to me is unexceptionable permit me therefore to dwell a moment longer on my favorite subject and i will conclude with what harmony might all parents and children live together if the father would strive to soften the rigor of age and remember that his son must naturally possess those qualities which ever accompany youth and if the son would in return endeavor to suit himself to those infirmities which his father received from old age if they would reciprocally study to be agreeable to each other the father would insensibly substitute affection in the room of authority and lose the churlish severity and peevishness incident to his years while the son would curb the unbecoming impetuosity of his youth change his reluctance to obey into a constant attention to please and remit much of his extreme gaiety in conformity to the gravity of his father wherever such a turn of mind is encouraged there must be happiness and agreeable society and the contrary qualities of youth and age thus compounded compose the surest cement of affection as colors of the most opposite tints by a skilful mixture each giving and receiving certain shades will form a picture the most heightened and exquisite in it is coloring  i am sir your most humble servant john bevill   the connoisseur by mr town critic and censorgeneral number lxxix thursday july          o te bollane cerebri felicem aiebam tacitus dum quidlibet ille garriret vicos urbem laudaret  hor to mr town sir i have been very much diverted with your observations on our honest tradesmen who make weekly excursions into the neighboring villages and i agree with you that the generality of our citizens seldom dare trust themselves out of the sight of london smoke or extend their travels further than with their wives and children in the wandsworth double postchaise or the hampton long coach but we may now and then pick up a stray citizen whom business has dragged beyond the bills of mortality as it happened to myself the other day about twenty miles from london and as i was mightily pleased with his behavior and conversation i have taken the liberty to send you an account of it  being caught in a shower upon the road i was glad to take shelter at the first inn i came to which if it had been called the new inn i should have thought from its antique appearance that it had been an house of entertainment in the time of our great grandfathers i had scarce alighted when a strange figure driven thither as i supposed on the same account with myself came soberly jogging into the yard dripping wet as he waited for the steps before he would venture to get off his horse i had the opportunity of surveying his whole appearance he was wrapped up in an old threadbare weatherbeaten surtout which i believe had once been scarlet the cape was pulled over his head and buttoned up close round his face and his hat was flapped down on each side and fastened about his ears with a list garter tied under his chin he wore upon his legs something that resembled splatterdashes which as i afterward learned were cut out of an old pair of boots but his right shoe was considerably larger than the other and had several slits in the upper leather he had spurs on indeed but without rowels and by way of whip a wormeaten cane with a bone head studded with brass pins hung from his wrist by a string of greasy black leather  i soon found i was nobody for the gentleman it seems took up the whole attention of the maid mistress and ostler who all of them got round him and with much difficulty by the assistance of the steps helped him down my landlady after the usual welcome before it was possible for her to see any part of him but his nose told him he looked brave and jolly and when she had led him into the kitchen she fetched a large glass of what she called her own water which she said would keep the cold out of his stomach all hands were now busied in drawing off his surtout which discovered underneath a fulltrimmed white coat and a black velvet waistcoat with a broad gold lace very much tarnished the surtout was hung to dry by the fire as well as his coat the place of which was supplied by a long ridinghood of my landlady and as the gentleman complained of having suffered by a loss of leather the maid was dispatched to the doctors for some diachylon the usual question now succeeded concerning dinner and as he observed i was all alone he very courteously offered me to join company which i as readily accepted  the important business of dinner being settled we adjourned into a private room when my fellowguest told me of his own accord that he lived in london that for these twenty years he had always come to the town we were now in once a year to receive money and take orders for goods and that he had always put up at this house he then run on in the praises of the landlady and tipping me a wink ay says he she has been a clever woman in her time before she bore children he added that for his part he did not like your great inns for that they never looked upon any thing under a coach and six he further informed me that he was married to his present wife in the first mayoralty of alderman parsons and in the very waistcoat he had on but says he i now wear it only on a journey because you know a bit of lace commands respect upon the road upon enquiring about his family i found he had three boys one of whom was bound prentice to himself the other was sent to sea because he was a wild one and the third he designed to make a parson of because he was grave and his playfellows at poules school used to call him bishop  all this while he had sat in my landladys ridinghood with a linen nightcap on his head tied on the top with a piece of black ribband which he told me he always rode in because it was cooler than a wig but the saddlebags were now ordered in and out of one of them he drew a large flowing grizzle carefully buckled which he combed out himself borrowing some flour from the kitchen drudger his splatterdashes were next taken off his shoes wiped with a wisp of hay and being assured by the landlady herself that his coat was dry enough to put on he completely equipped himself in order to wait on several tradesmen with whom he had dealings after dinner as this was not quite ready we took a walk to the stables to see his mare and though the beast seemed as lean and harmless as sanchos ass he assured me he had much ado to ride her she was so frisky for she had not run in the chaise these two sundays past  being summoned in to dinner we sat down to a repast of mutton chops and sheeps hearts which last he declared to be the wholsomest eating in the world he objected to wine because there was not a drop good for any thing to be got upon the road but he vastly recommended my landladys homebrewed which he affirmed to be better than hogsden ale or the thatch beer at islington our meal being ended my companion took his pipe and we laid our heads together for the good of the nation when we mauled the french terribly both by land and sea at last among other talk he happened to ask me if i lived in the city as i was desirous of hearing his remarks i answered that i had never seen london never seen it says he then you have never seen one of the finest sights in the whole world paris is but a doghole to it there luckily hung a large map of london over the chimneypiece which he immediately made me get from my chair to look at there says he there is london for you  you see it is bigger than the map of all england he then led me about with the end of his pipe through all the principal streets from hydepark to whitechapel  that says he is the river thames  there is london bridge  there my lord mayor lives  that is poules  there the monument stands and now if you was but on the top of it you might see all the houses and churches in london i expressed my astonishment at every particular but i could hardly refrain laughing when pointing out to me lincolns inn fields  there said he there all the noblemen live at last after having transported me all over the town he set me down in cheapside which he said was the biggest street in the city  and now says he i will show you where i live  that is bowchurch  and thereabouts  where my pipe is  there  just there my shop stands he concluded with a kind invitation to me to come and see him and pulling out a book of patterns from his coatpocket assured me that if i wanted any thing in his way he could afford to let me have a bargain  i promised to call upon him and the weather now clearing up after settling the balance of our reckoning with the landlady we took leave of each other but just as i had mounted my horse and was going to set forward my new acquaintance came up to me and shaking me by the hand  hearkye says he if you will be in town by the twenty fifth of this instant july i will introduce you to the cockneys feast where i assure you you will be mighty merry and hear a great many good songs   the connoisseur by mr town critic and censorgeneral number lxxx thursday august        nulla viri cura interea nec mentio fiet damnorum  juv to mr town sir if polygamy was allowed in this country i am sure i might maintain a seraglio of wives at less expense than i have brought upon myself by marrying one woman one did i say alas i find it to my cost that a wife like a polypus has the power of dividing and multiplying herself into as many bodies as she pleases you must know mr town i took a woman of small fortune and made her my own flesh and blood but i never thought that all her relations would likewise fasten on me with as little ceremony as a colony of fleas i had scarce brought her home before i was obliged to marry her mother then i was prevailed on to marry her two maiden sisters after that i married her aunts then her cousins  in short i am now married to the whole generation of them i do not exaggerate matters when i say that i am married to them all for they claim as much right to every thing that is mine as the person whom the world calls my wife they eat drink and sleep with me every room in my house is at their command except my bedchamber they borrow money of me  and since i have the whole family quartered upon me what signifies which of them takes upon her my name  my wife her sister or her twentieth cousin  o mr town i never sit down to table without the lamentable prospect of seeing as much victuals consumed as would dine a whole vestry so many mouths constantly going at my expense and then there is such variety of provisions for cousin biddy likes one dish my aunt rachel is fond of another sister molly cannot abide this and mother could never touch that  though i find they are all of them unanimous in liking the best of every thing in season besides i could entertain a set of jolly topers at a less rate than it costs me in light wines for the women one of them drinks nothing but lisbon with another nothing goes down but rhenish and spa a third swallows me an ocean of bristol milk with as little remorse as she would so much small beer my eldest aunt likes a glass of dry mountain while the other thinks nothing helps digestion so well as madeira twas but the other day that my wife expressed a desire of tasting some claret when immediately all my goodnatured relations had a mighty longing for it but with much ado i at last prevailed on them to compound with me for a chest of florence  you may imagine that my house cannot be a very small one and i assure you there are as many beds in it as in a country inn yet i have scarce room to turn myself about in it for one apartment is taken up by this relation another by that and the most distant cousin must have more respect shown her than to be clapped up in a garret with the maidservants so that poor i have no more liberty in my own house than a lodger once indeed i in vain endeavored to shake them off and took a little box in the neighborhood of town scarce big enough to hold my own family but alas they stuck as close to it as a snail to her shell and rather than not lie under the same roof with their relation they contrived to litter together like so many pigs in a stye at another time thinking to clear my house at once of these vermin i packed up my wife and mother and sent them to her uncles in the country for a month but what could i do there was no getting rid of those left behind my wife had made over to them the care of the household allotting to each of them her particular employment during her absence one was to pickle walnuts another to preserve sweetmeats another to make morella brandy all which they executed with the notableness peculiar to good housewives who spoil and waste more than they save for the satisfaction of making these things at home at last my wife returned and all that i got by her journey was the importation of two new cousins fresh out of the country who she never knew before were the least related to her  but they have been so kind as to claim kindred with me by hanging upon me ever since  one would imagine that it were sufficient for these loving relations to have the run of my table and to make my house in every respect their own but not content with this they have the cunning to oblige me in a manner to find them in clothes likewise i should not repine if any of my worthy relations were humble enough to put up with a castoff suit of my wifes but that would be robbing the maid of her just dues and would look more like a dependant than a relation not but that they will condescend now and then to take a gown before it is half worn out when they have talked my wife into a dislike of it  because it is too good for a common servant they have more spirit than to beg any thing but  if my wife has a fancy to part with it  they will wear it purely for her sake a cap an apron or an handkerchief which looks hideous upon her i always find is very becoming on any other of the family and i remember soon after we were married happening to find fault with the pattern of a silk brocade my wife had just bought one of her sisters took it from her and told me she would have it made up for herself and wear it on purpose to spite me  you must know mr town that upon my marriage i was indiscreet enough to set up my chariot and since my family has increased so prodigiously this has given them a handle to have a coach likewise and another pair of horses for them to take an airing in this also furnishes them with a pretense for running about to public diversions where i am forced to treat them all for they are so very fond of each others company that one will hardly ever stir out without the other thus at home or abroad they constantly herd together and what is still more provoking though i had rather have a route every week at my house my wife makes a merit of it that she keeps little or no company  such is the state of my family within doors and though you would think this sufficient for one man i can assure you that i have other calls on me from relations no less dear to me though i have never yet had the happiness to see them a third cousin by my wifes fathers side was set up in the country in a very good way of business but by misfortunes in trade must have gone to jail if my wife had not teized me into being bound for him and for which i was soon after arrested and obliged to pay the money another a very promising youth was just out of his time and only wanted a little sum to set him up which as soon as i had lent him he run away and is gone to sea one of the aunts who is now with me a widow lady has an only daughter a sober discreet body who lived as a companion with an old gentlewoman in the country but the poor innocent girl being drawn aside by a vile fellow that ruined her i have been forced to support the unhappy mother and child ever since to prevent any reproach falling on our family i shall say nothing of the various presents which have traveled down to my wifes uncle in return for one turkey and chine received at christmas nor shall i put to account the charge i have been at in the gossips fees and in buying corals etc for half a dozen little nephews neices and cousins to which i had the honor of standing godfather  and now mr town the mention of this last circumstance makes me reflect with an heavy heart on a new calamity which will shortly befall me my wife you must know is very near her time and they have provided as great a store of caps clouts biggens bellybands whittles and all kinds of childbedlinnen as would set up a lyingin hospital you will conclude that my family wants no further increase yet would you believe it i have just received a letter that another aunt and another cousin are coming up in the stage coach to see their relation and are resolved to stay with her the month indeed i am afraid when they have once got footing in my house they will resolve to stay with her till she has another and another child  i am sir your humble servant etc   the connoisseur by mr town critic and censorgeneral number lxxxi thursday august          genus

the bills of mortality but now every london refinement travels to the remotest corner of the kingdom and the polite families from the town duly import to their distant seats the customs and manners of pall mall and grosvenorsquare  i have been for this fortnight past at lord courtleys who for about four months in every year leads a town life at the distance of above two hundred miles from london he never rises till twelve or one oclock though indeed he often sees the sun rise but then that only happens when as the old song says he has drank down the moon drinking is the only rural amusement he persues but even that part of his diversions is conducted entirely in the london fashion he does not swill country ale but gets drunk with champagne and burgundy and every dish at his table is served up with as much elegance as at whites or ryans he has an excellent pack of hounds but i believe was never in at the death of a fox in his life yet strangers never want a chase for the hounds are out three times a week with a younger brother of lord courtleys who never saw london in his life and who if he was not indulged with a place at his lordships table might naturally be considered as his whipperin or his gamekeeper  the eveningwalk is a thing unknown and unheard of at lord courtleys for though situated in a very fine country he knows no more of the charms of purling streams and shady groves than if they never existed but in poetry or romance as soon as the daily debauch after dinner and the ceremonies of coffee and tea are over the company is conducted into a magnificent apartment illuminated with waxcandles and set but with as many cardtables as the route of a foreign ambassadors lady here faro whist brag lansquenet and every other fashionable game make up the evenings entertainment this piece of politeness has sometimes fallen heavy on some honest country gentlemen who have found dining with his lordship turn out a very dear ordinary and many a good lady has had occasion to curse the cards and her illstarred connections with persons of quality though his lordship is never at a loss for a party for as several people of fashion have seats near him he often sits down with some of his friends of the club at whites i had almost forgot to mention that her ladyship keeps a day which is sunday  this dear cousin is the genteel manner of living in the country and i cannot help observing that persons polite enough to be fond of such exquisite refinements are partly in the same case with the mechanic at his dusty villa they both indeed change their situation but neither find the least alteration in their ideas the tradesman when at his box has all the notions that employ him in his comptinghouse and the nobleman though in the farthest part of england may

it a very striking contrast to the character described in the enclosed paper i hope your readers will not do either you or me the honor to think this natural description a mere creature of the imagination the picture of the extraordinary gentleman here described is now at the seat of lord shaftsbury at st giless near cranborn in dorsetshire and this lively character of him was really and

strong and very active of a reddish flaxen hair his clothes always green cloth and never all worth when new five pounds  his house was perfectly of the old fashion in the midst of a large park well stocked with deer and near the house rabits to serve his kitchen many fishponds great store of wood and timber a bowling green in it long but narrow full of high ridges it being never levelled since it was ploughd they used round sand bowls and it had a banqueting house like a stand built in a tree  he kept all manner of sport hounds that ran buck fox hare otter and badger and hawks long and short winged he had all sorts of nets for fish he had a walk in the new forest and the manor of christchurch this last supplied him with red deer sea and river fish and indeed all his neighbors grounds and royalties were free to him who bestowed all his time on these sports but what he borrowed to caress his neighbors wives and daughters there being not a woman in all his walks of the degree of a yeomans wife or under and under the age of forty but it was extremely her fault if he was not intimately acquainted with her this made him very popular always speaking kindly to the husband brother or father who was to boat very welcome to his house whenever he came there he found beef pudding and small beer in great plenty a house not so neatly kept as to shame him or his dirty shoes the great hall strowd with marrowbones full of hawksperches hounds spaniels and terriers the upper side of the hall hung with foxskins of this and the last years kiiling here and there a polecat intermixed gamekeepers and hunters poles in great abundance  the parlour was a large room as properly furnished on a great hearth paved with brick lay some terriers and the choicest hounds and spaniels seldom but two of the great chairs had litters of young cats in them which were not to be disturbed he having always three or four attending him at dinner and a little white round stick of fourteen inches lying by his trencher that he might defend such meat as he had no mind to part with to them the windows which were very large served for places to lay his arrows crossbows stonebows and other such like accoutrements the corners of the room full of the bestchose hunting and hawking poles an oyster table at the lower end which was of constant use twice a day all the year round for he never failed to eat oysters before dinner and supper through all seasons the neighboring town of pool supplied him with them  the upper part of the room had two small tables and a desk on the one side of which was a church bible and on the other the book of martyrs on the table were hawkshoods bells and such like two or three old green hats with their crowns thrust in so as to hold ten or a dozen eggs which were of a pheasant kind of poultry he took much care of and fed himself tables dice cards and boxes were not wanting in the hole of the desk were store of tobacco pipes that had been used  on one side of this end of the room was the door of a closet wherein stood the strong beer and the wine which never came thence but in single glasses that being the rule of the house exactly observed for he never exceeded in drink or permitted it  on the other side was the door into an old chapel not used for devotion the pulpit as the safest place was never wanting of a cold chine of beef venison pasty gammon of bacon or great applepye with thick crust extremely baked  his table cost him not much though it was good to eat at his sports supplied all but beef and mutton except fridays when he had the best saltfish as well as other fish he could get and was the day his neighbors of best quality most visited him he never wanted a london pudding and always sung it in with my

stirred with rosemary  he was well natured but soon angry calling his servants bastards and cuckoldy knaves in one of which he often spoke truth to his own knowledge and sometimes in both though of

for the instruction of a young gentleman going to the university yet as it contains several just and sensible reflections which may be of use to many of my readers i have willingly complied with the request of my correspondent in making it the entertainment of today  dear sir as you are now going to the university i would not be thought to pay so ill a compliment to your own natural good sense as to suppose that you will not like many young gentlemen of fortune in some measure apply yourself to study otherwise the time you spend there will be entirely lost for as the spectator very justly remarks all ornamental parts of education are better taught in other places at the same time i do not mean that you should commence pedant and be continually poring on a book since that will rather puzzle than inform the understanding though i know many sprightly young gentlemen of lively and quick parts affect to despise it altogether it will be necessary to learn something of logic i mean in the same manner one would learn fencing  not to attack others but to defend ones self in a word you will find it a great unhappiness when you return hither if you do not bring with you some taste for reading for a mere country gentleman who can find no society in books will have little else to do besides following his sports but to sit as squire of the company tippling among a parcel of idle wretches whose understandings are nearly on a level with his dogs and horses  it has been an established maxim that the world will always form an opinion of persons according to the company they are known to keep in the university as well as in other places there are people whom we ought to avoid as we would the plague and as it is of the utmost consequence whether you plunge at once into extravagance and debauchery or sink gradually into indolence and stupidity i shall point out some of these pests of society in as few words as possible  the first person i would caution you against is the wretch that takes a delight to turn religion into ridicule one that employs that speech which was given him by god to celebrate his praise in questioning his very being this as it is impious in itself is likewise the height of illmanners it is hoped there are but few of them to be met with in a place of sound doctrine and religious education but wherever they are they ought as much as possible to be avoided and if they will force themselves into our company they should be used with the same contempt with which they have the hardiness to treat their maker and this i can assure you may be done safely for i never knew any body who pretended to be above the fear of god but was under the most terrible apprehensions whenever attacked by man  the next character whom i would advise you to shun is the gamester in some respects not unlike the former the gamingtable is his shrine and fortune his deity nor does he ever speak or think of any other unless by way of blasphemy oaths and curses when he has had a bad run at cards or dice he has not the least notion of friendship but would ruin his own brother if it might be of any advantage to himself he indeed professes himself your friend but that is only with a design to draw you in for his trade is inconsistent with the principles of honor or justice without which there can be no real friendship it should therefore be the care of every gentleman not to hold any commerce with such people whose acquaintance he cannot enjoy without giving up his estate  the next person whom you ought to beware of is a drunkard one that takes an unaccountable pleasure in sapping his constitution and drowning his understanding he constantly goes senseless to bed and rises maukish in the morning nor can he be easy in body or mind till he has renewed his dose and again put himself beyond the reach of reflection i would therefore entreat you by all means to avoid an habit which will at once ruin your health and impair your intellects it is a misfortune that society should be esteemed dull and insipid without the assistance of the bottle to enliven it so that a man cannot entirely refrain from his glass if he keeps any company at all but let it be remembered that in drinking as well as in talking we ought always to keep a watch over the doors of our lips  a lownger is a creature that you will often see lolling in a coffeehouse or sauntering about the streets with great calmness and a most inflexible stupidity in his countenance he takes as much pains as the sot to fly from his own thoughts and is at length happily arrived at the highest pitch of indolence both in mind and body he would be as inoffensive as he is dull if it were not that his idleness is contagious for like the torpedo he is sure to benumb and take away all sense of feeling from every one with whom he happens to come in contact  it were also best to forbear the company of a wrangler or a person of a litigious temper this sometimes arises not from any great share of ill nature but from a vain pride of showing ones parts or skill in argumentation it is frequently observed of young academics in particular that they are very apt impertinently to engage people in a dispute whether they will or not but this is contrary to all the rules of goodbreeding and is never practiced by any man of sense that has seen much of the world i have sometimes known a person of great sauciness and volubility of expression confuted by the argumentum baculinum and both his head and his syllogism broken at the same time  i need not point out to you the profligate rake or the affected coxcomb as persons from whose company you can reap no sort of benefit from the first the good principles already instilled into you will doubtless preserve you and i am sure you have too much real sense not to despise the absurd fopperies of the latter noted liars are no less to be avoided as the common pests of society they are often of a mischievous disposition and by their calumnies and false suggestions take a pleasure in setting the most intimate friends at variance but if they only deal in harmless and improbable lies their acquaintance must frequently be out of countenance for them and if we should venture to repeat after them i am sure it is the way to be out of countenance for ourselves  but above all i must advise you never to engage at least not with any degree of violence in any party be not transported by the clamorous jollity of talking patriots beyond the sober dictates of reason and justice nor let the insinuating voice of corruption tempt you to barter your integrity and peace of mind for the paultry satisfaction of improving your fortune if you behave with honor and prudence you will be regarded and courted by all parties but if otherwise you will certainly be despised by all perhaps indeed if you should hereafter engage in elections and spend your own money to support anothers cause the person in whose interest you are may shake you by the hand and swear you are a very honest gentleman  just as butchers treat their bulldogs who spit in their mouths clap them on the back and then halloo them on to be tossed and torn by the horns of their antagonist  after having guarded you against the evil influence of your own sex i cannot conclude without throwing in a word or two concerning the ladies but that i may not be thought unmannerly to the fair i shall pass over their faults only hoping that their excellencies will not tempt you to precipitate a match with one much your inferior in birth and fortune though endowed with every accomplishment requisite to make the marriage state happy in these hasty and unequal matches it sometimes happens that mutual love gives way to mutual reproaches we may perhaps too late repent of our bargain and though repentance be an excellent visiting friend when she reminds us of our past miscarriages and prescribes rules how to avoid them for the future yet she is a most troublesome companion when fixed upon us for life  i am dear sir your sincere friend etc h a   the connoisseur by mr town critic and censorgeneral number lxxxiii thursday august          me literulas stulti docuere parents mart since genius is the chief requisite in all kinds of poetry nothing can be more contrary to the very essence of it than the adopting as beauties certain arts which are merely mechanical there are daily arising many whimsical excellencies which have no foundation in nature but are only countenanced by the present mode of writing with these it is as easy to fill our compositions as to dress ourselves in the fashion but the writer who puts his work together in this manner is no more a poet than his tailor such productions often betray great labor and exactness but show no genius for those who sit down to write by rule and follow dry receipts how poems should be made may compose their pieces without the least assistance from the imagination as an apothecarys prentice though unable to cure any disease can make up medicines from the physicians prescription with no more knowledge of physic than the names of the drugs thus the muse that ought to fly and ascend the brightest heaven of invention walks in leadingstrings or is supported by a gocart  among the many poetical tricks of this sort none has been more successfully practiced or had more advocates and admirers than a certain fantastical conceit called alliteration which is nothing more than beginning two three or perhaps every word in a line with the same letter this method of running divisions upon the alphabet and pressing particular letters into the service has been accounted one of the first excellencies in versification and has indeed received the sanction of some of our best poets but wherein the beauty of it consists is something difficult to discover since quarles or withers might practice it with as much adroitness as dryden or spenser it is one of those modern arts in poetry which require no fancy judgment or learning in the execution for an author may huddle the same letters on each other again and again as mechanically as the printer selects his types and ranges them in whatsoever order he pleases  this partial attachment to particular letters is a kind of contrast to the famous odyssey of tryphiodorus where every letter in the alphabet was in its turn excluded and the alliterator must be as busily employed to introduce his favorite vowel or consonant as the greek poet to shut out the letter he had proscribed nothing is esteemed a greater beauty in poetry than a happy choice of epithets but alliteration reduces all the elegancies of expression to a very narrow compass epithets are culled indeed with great exactness but the closest relation they are intended to bear to the word to which they are joined is that the initials are the same thus the fields must be flowery beauty must be beaming ladies must be lovely and in the same manner must the waves wind their watery way the blustering blasts blow and locks all loosely lay not for the sake of the poetry but the elegance of the alliteration this beauty has also taken possession of many of our tragedies and i have seen ladies wooed and heroes killed in it though i must own i never hear an actor dying with deadly darts and fiery flames etc but it always puts me in mind of the celebrated pippinwoman in gays trivia whose head when it was severed from her body rolled along the ice crying pip pip pip and expired in alliteration  the same false taste in writing that wings displayed and altars raised also introduced alliteration and acrostics in particular are the same kind of spellingbook poetry it is therefore somewhat extraordinary that those sublime writers who have disgraced their pages with it did not leave this as well as the other barbarous parts of literature to the goths in poetry since it is a whimsical beauty below the practice of any writer superior to him who turned the aencid into monkish verses shakespeare who was more indebted to nature than art has ridiculed this low trick with great humor in his burlesque tragedy of pyramus and thisbe besides that noted passage of  with blade with bloody blameful blade he bravely broached his boiling bloody breast he before introduces a mock rant which bottom calls ercles vein which is not only rank fustian but is also remarkable for its alliteration to make all split the raging rocks and shivering shocks shall break the locks of prison gates  and phibbus car shall shine from far and make and mar the foolish fates in this strange style have whole poems been written and every learned reader will recollect on this occasion the pugna porcorum per p porcium poetam which i wish some of our poetasters would translate in the true spirit of the original and praise pigs and pork with all the beauties of alliteration  the advocates and admirers of this practice have asserted that it adds significance and strength of expression to their verses but i fear this boasted energy seldom appears to the reader the alliteration either remains unregarded or if it is very striking disgusts those who perceive it and is often in itself from such a disagreeable cluster of the same letters harsh and uncouth there are very many instances where alliteration though studiously introduced renders the versification rough and inharmonious and i will appeal to the greatest lovers of it whether the following line where the repetition was scarce intended is one of the most pleasing in all virgils works neu patriae validas in viscera vertite vires   it must be acknowledged that there is something very mechanical in the whole construction of the numbers in most of our modern poetry sound is more attended to than sense and the words are expected to express more than the sentiment there are set rules to make verses run off glibly or drawl slowly on etc and i have read many a poem with scarce one tolerable thought in it that has contained all these excellencies of versification for which reason i must confess myself no friend to those critics who analyze words and syllables and discover latent beauties in every letter when the author intended that the whole should be taken together poetry should seem at least to flow freely from the imagination and not to be squeezed from the droppings of the brain if we would endeavor to acquire a full idea of what we mean to describe we should then of course express ourselves with force elegance and perspicuity and this native strength of expression would have more true energy than elaborate phrases and a quaint and studied combination of words and letters fine numbers are undoubtedly one of the chief beauties in poetry but to make the sound echo to the sense we should make the sense our chief object this appears to me to have been the manly practice of the ancients and of our own shakespeare milton etc who breathed the true spirit of poetry without having recourse to little tricks and mean artifices which only serve to disgrace it a good writer who would be above triffling even with a thought would never pursue words and play with letters but leave such a childish employment for the small fry of rhimers who amuse themselves with anagrams and crambo the true poet trusts to his natural ear and strong conception and knows that the versification is adapted to the sentiment without culling particular letters and stringing them on his lines as he is sure that his verses are just measure without scanning them on his fingers  there are almost daily published certain lilliputian volumes entitled pretty books for children a friend of mine who considers the little rhimers of the age as only children of a larger growth who amuse themselves with rhimes instead of rattles proposes to publish a small pocket volume for the use of our poetasters it will be a treatise on the art of poetry adapted to the meanest capacities for which subscriptions will be taken and specimens may be seen at georges and the bedford coffeehouses it will contain full directions how to modulate the numbers on every occasion and will instruct the young scribbler in all the modern arts of versification he will here meet with infallible rules how to soften a line and lull us to sleep with liquids and dipthongs to roughen the verse and make it roar again with reiteration of the letter r to set it hissing with semivowels to make it pant and breathe short with a hundred heavy aspirates or clog it up with the thickest double consonants and monosyllables with a particular table of alliteration containing the choicest epithets for any words that can be wanted to be illustrated with examples from the modern poets the whole to be published about the middle of the winter under the title of the rhimers plaything or poetasters hornbook since there is nothing necessary to form such a poet except teaching him his letters  the connoisseur by mr town critic and censorgeneral number lxxxiv thursday september         tu dum tua navis in alto est hoc age  hor to mr town sir you obliged the world some time ago with a few reflections on the gentlemen of the army at the present juncture a word or two on our seaofficers would not be unseasonable i do not mean that you should presume to direct them how to behave in their several stations but rather to remark on their conduct and conversation in private life as far as they are influenced by their maritime characters there is a certain unfashionable dye which their manners often take from the salt water that tinctures their whole behavior on shore if you could assist in blotting out these stains and give a new color to their conduct you would add grace and politeness to their ordinary conversation and would be of as much service to our naval commanders in this point as he was to navigation in general who first invented the compass  as the conversation of those fairweather foplings many of whom may be met with in the three regiments of guards is usually flat and insipid that of our seaofficers is turbulent and boisterous and as a trip to paris has perhaps overrefined the coxcomb in red a voyage round the world frequently brutalizes the seaman who comes home so rough and unpolished that one would imagine he had not visited any nation in the world except the savages the chinese or the hottentots the many advantages he has received from having seen the customs and manners of so many different people it is natural to suppose would render his conversation very desirable as being in itself particularly instructive and entertaining but this roughness which clings to the seamans behavior like tar to his trowsers makes him unfit for all civil and polite society he behaves at an assembly as if he was upon deck and his whole deportment manifestly betrays that he is according to the common phrase quite out of his element nor can you collect any more from him concerning the several nations he has visited than if he had been during the whole time confined to his cabin and he seems to know as little of them as the fine gentleman of his travels after the polite tour when he has for the sake of improvement rid post through all europe  that our ordinary seamen who are many of them draughted from the very lowest of the populace should be thus uncivilized is no wonder the common sailors education in broad st giless tottenham court or at hockley in the hole has not qualified him to improve by just reflections on what he sees during his voyage and going on board a man of war is a kind of university education suitably adapted to the principles imbibed in the polite seminaries which he came from a common sailor too is full as polite as a common soldier and behaves as genteely to a wapping landlady as the gentleman soldier at a suttlinghouse but surely there ought to be as much difference in the behavior of the commander and his crew as there is in their situation and it is beneath the dignity of the british flag to have an admiral behave as rudely as a swabber or a commodore as foulmouthed as a boatswain  it may perhaps be alleged in excuse that the being placed among such a boisterous set of people as our common sailors must unavoidably wear off all politeness and goodmanners as it is remarkable that all those who are employed in the care of horses grow as mere brutes as the animals they attend and as we may often observe those justices whose chief business is the examination of highwaymen housebreakers and streetwalkers grow at least as vulgar and foulmouthed as a pickpocket as there may be some truth in this the commander should therefore be still more on his guard to preserve the gentleman in his behavior and like the sea itself when the storm is over grow smooth and calm it is accounted a piece of humor on the thames to abuse the other passengers on the water and there are certain set terms of abuse which fly to and fro from one boat to another on this occasion a wag might perhaps amuse himself with this waterlanguage in his voyage to vauxhall but must be a very silly fellow indeed to think of carrying the joke on shore with him in the same manner some roughness may perhaps be necessary to keep the crew in order but it is absurd for an officer to retain his harshness in polite company and is in a manner tying his friends up to the yardarm and disciplining all his acquaintance with the catofninetails  but the worst part of this maritime character is a certain invincible contempt which they often contract for all mankind except their fellowseamen they look on the rest of the world as a set of fresh water wretches who could be of no service in a storm or an engagement and from an unaccountable obstinacy are particularly deaf to any proposals of new improvements in navigation though experience daily teaches them the great use of the discoveries already made and how much room there is for more they have no notion how studious men can sit in their closets and devise charts and instruments to direct them in their course and despise those ingenious persons who would assist them in their undertakings while they consider them with the utmost contempt as going round the world in their closets and sailing at sea in their elbowchairs it is no less shameful than true that the ventilator one of the most beneficial inventions that ever was devised was first offered to the service of our men of war and rejected it was first used in foreign ships then by our merchantmen and last of all among our men of war to whose use it was first recommended this is a strong proof of that fatal obstinacy which our seacommanders are too apt to contract and as a further instance of it i have been told of an admirals indignation on this subject venting itself in the following manner a pack of blockheads said he sit poring and pretend to make improvements for our use they tell you that they discover this and discover that but i tell you they are all fools  for instance now they say the world is round every one of them says the world is round  but i have been all round the world and it is as flat as this table  the chief reason of their unpolished behavior is owing to their being often sent to sea very young with little or no education beyond what they have received perhaps at the academy of woolwich or portsmouth a lad of good family but untoward parts or mischievous disposition who has been flogged for a while at the grammar school or snubbed by his parents and friends at home is frequently clapped on board a ship in order to tame him and to teach him better manners here perhaps he at first messes with the lowest of the seamen and all that the young gentleman can learn from his jolly mesmates in the course of two or three voyages is to drink flip sing a bawdy catch and dance an hornpipe these genteel accomplishments he is sure to retain as he grows old in the service and if he has the good fortune to rise to a command he is as surly and brutal when advanced to the cabin as when he was tugging before the mast  after all it is but justice to confess that there are many among our seaofficers who deservedly bear the character of gentlemen and scholars and it is easy to perceive with how much better grace they appear in the world than the rest of their brethren who when laid up and taken out of service are as mere logs as the mainmast an officer who has any relish for reading will employ the many vacant hours in which he is relieved from duty much more to his improvement and satisfaction than in sauntering between the decks or muddling over a bowl of punch i would therefore seriously recommend it to those young sailors who have the happiness to launch forth with a genteel and liberal education not to suffer every trace of it to be washed away like words written on the sands but that when they return from sea they may be fit to be admitted at st jamess as well as at wapping or rotherhithe  before i conclude i must beg leave to say a word or two concerning our seachaplains the common sailors are known to have when on board a very serious regard for religion and their decent behavior at prayers and sedate attention to the sermon upon quarter deck might shame a more polite audience at st jamess church for this reason a truly religious chaplain of good morals and sober conversation will necessarily have as much influence on their behavior as a mild and prudent commander nor can a clergyman be too circumspect in this point since if he does not act in every respect conformable to his function his place for ought i know might be as well supplied by any one of the unbeneficed doctors of the fleet in a word if a chaplain will so far divest himself of his sacred character as to drink swear and behave in every respect like a common sailor he should be obliged to work in the gangway all the rest of the week and on sundays be invested with a jacket and trowsers instead of his canonicals  i am sir your humble servant t forecastle   the connoisseur by mr town critic and censorgeneral number lxxxv thursday september          nos animorum impulsu et caeca magnaque cupidine ducti hor so long ago as my fourth number the reader perhaps may not remember i made mention of a female thermometer constructed by my ingenious friend mr james ayscough optician on ludgate hill and i then informed the public that the liquor contained within the tube was a chemical mixture which being acted upon by the circulation of the blood and animal spirits would rise and fall according to the desires and affections of the wearer but i have now the further satisfaction to acquaint my fair readers that after several repeated trials and improvements we have at length brought the instrument to so great a degree of perfection that any common bystander may by a proper application of it know the exact temperature of any ladys passions the liquor among other secret ingredients is distilled secundum artem from the herbs ladys love and maidenhair the wax of virginbees and the five greater hot and cold seeds and the properties of it are so subtle and penetrating that immediately on its coming within the atmosphere of a ladys affections it is actuated by them in the same manner as the spirits are by the impulse of the air in the common thermometer  it was not without some difficulty that we could settle the different degrees of heat and cold in a ladys desires which it would be proper to delineate on our thermometer but at last we found that the whole scale of female characters might be reduced to one or other of the following viz abandoned impudence  gallantry  loose behavior  innocent freedoms  indiscretions inviolable modesty   from these degrees which we have accurately marked on the side of the tube we have been able to judge of the characters of several ladies on whom we have made the experiment in some of these we have found the gradations very sudden and that the liquor has risen very fast from the lowest point to the highest we could likewise discover that it was differently affected according to the different station and quality of the subject so that the same actions which in a lady of fashion scarce raised the liquor beyond indiscretions in another caused it to mount almost to impudence much also depended upon the air and temperature of the place where we made our trials and even the dress had some influence on our thermometer as we frequently observed that the rise and fall of the liquor in the tube bore an exact proportion to the rise and fall of the stays and petticoat  i shall now proceed to give a succinct account of the many repeated experiments which we have made on different subjects in different places during the winter season we had frequent opportunities of trying the effects which the playhouse the opera and other places of diversion might have on the thermometer at the playhouse we always found the liquor rise in proportion as the drama was more or less indecent or immoral at some comedies and particularly the chances its elevation kept pace exactly with the lusciousness of the dialogue and the ripening of the plot so that it has often happened that with some subjects at the opening of the play the liquor has struggled awhile and rose and sunk about the degrees just above modesty but before the third act it has stood suspended at the middle point between modesty and impudence in the fourth act it has advanced as far as loose behavior and at the conclusion of the play it has settled at downright impudence at public concerts and the opera especially we observed that the thermometer constantly kept time if i may say so with the music and singing and both at the opera and the playhouse it always regulated its motions by the dancers heels we have frequently made trials of our instrument at the masquerades in the haymarket but the temperature of that climate has proved so exceeding hot that on the moment of our coming into the room the liquor has boiled up with a surprising effervescence to abandoned impudence  during the summer season we have not failed to make our observations on the company at the public gardens here we found indeed that with some raw unpolished females who came only to eat cheesecakes and see the fireworks the liquor did not stir beyond modesty with many it has crept up to indiscretions and with some it has advanced to loose behavior we had no opportunity to try our thermometer in the dark walks but with some subjects we have plainly perceived the liquor hastening up toward innocent freedoms as they were retiring to these walks from the rest of the company whilst with others who have gone the same way it has only continued to point as it did at the beginning of our observations at gallantry one young lady in particular we could not help remarking whom we followed into vauxhall gallanted by an officer we were glad to see at her first going in that the liquor though it now and then faintly aspired toward indiscretions still gravitated back again to modesty after a turn or two in the walks we perceived it fluctuating between innocent freedoms and loose behavior after this we lost sight of them for some time and at the conclusion of the entertainment as we followed them out we could not without concern observe that the liquor was hastily bubbling up to a degree next to impudence  besides the experiments on those ladies who frequent the public places of diversion we have been no less careful in making remarks at several private routs and assemblies we were here at first very much surprised at the extreme degree of cold which our thermometer seemed to indicate in several ladies who were seated round the cardtables as we found not the least alteration in it either from the young or old but we at last concluded that this was owing to their love of play which had totally absorbed all their other passions we have indeed more than once perceived that when a lady has risen from cards after so much ill luck as to have involved herself in a debt of honor to a gentleman the thermometer has been surprisingly effected and as she has been handed to her chair we have known the liquor which before was quite stagnate run up instantaneously to the degree of gallantry we have also been at the trouble to try its efficacy in the long rooms at bath tunbridge cheltenham etc as it is well known that these places have brought about surprising changes in the constitutions of those sick ladies who go thither for the benefit of the waters  having thus sufficiently proved the perfection of our thermometer it only remains to acquaint my readers that mr ayscough will be ready to supply the public with these useful instruments as soon as the town fills in the mean time i would advise those ladies who have the least regard for their characters to reflect that the gradations as marked on our thermometer naturally lead to each other that the transitions from the lowest to the highest are quick and obvious and that though it is very easy to advance it is impossible to recede back again let them therefore be careful to regulate their passions in such manner as that their conduct may be always consistent with decency and honor and as shakespeare says not stepping over the bounds of modesty i shall conclude with observing that these thermometers are designed only for the ladies for though we imagined at first that they might serve equally for the men we have found reason to alter our opinion since in the course of several fruitless experiments on our own sex there has scarce appeared any medium in them between modesty and impudence  the connoisseur by mr town critic and censorgeneral number lxxxvi thursday september          via sacra sicut meus est mos nescio quid meditans nugarum et totus in illis hor to mr town sir it has been generally imagined that learning is only to be acquired in the closet and by turning over a great number of pages for which reason men have been assiduous to heap together a parcel of dusty volumes and our youth have been sent to study at the universities as if knowledge was shut up in a library and chained to the shelves together with the folios this prejudice has made every one overlook the most obvious and ready means of coming at literature while as the wise man has remarked wisdom cries without she utters her voice in the streets she cries in the chief place of concourse in the openings of the gates in the city she utters her words and no man regards her every lane teems with instruction and every alley is big with erudition though the ignorant or incurious passerby shuts his eyes against that universal volume of arts and sciences which constantly lies open before him in the highways and byeplaces like the laws of the romans which were hung up in the public streets  you must know mr town that i am a very hard student and have perhaps gleaned more knowledge from my reading than any of your poring fellows of colleges though i was never possessed of so much as an hornbook in the course of my studies i have followed the example of of the ancient peripatetics who used to study walking and as i had not the advantage to be brought up a scholar i have been obliged like the lacedaemonian children to the public for my education my first relish for letters i got by conning over those elegant monosyllables which are chalked out upon walls and gates and which as pretty books for children are adorned with cuts are generally enforced and explained by curious hieroglyphics in caricatura i soon made a further progress in the alphabet by staring up at the large letters upon playbills etc till at length i was enabled to make out the inscriptions upon signs bills on empty houses and the titles on rubricposts from these i proceeded gradually to higher branches of literature and went through a complete course of physic by perusing the learned treatises of dr rock and other eminent practitioners having thus laid in the rudiments of literature my method has since been to visit the philobiblian libraries and other learned stalls and the noble collections at moorfields in which choice repositories i have with infinite pleasure and advantage ran over the elaborate systems of ancient divines politicians and philosophers which have escaped the fury of pastrycooks and trunkmakers as for the modern writings of pamphletteers and magazinecompilers i make it my business to take my rounds every morning at the open shops about the royal exchange where i never fail to run through every thing fresh as it comes out thus for example i make a shift to squint over the first page of the connoisseur as it lies before me at mrs cookes at the next shop i steal a peep at the middle pages at another proceed on to the fourth or fifth and perhaps return again to conclude it at mrs cookes by the same means i am myself become a connoisseur likewise and you will be surprised when i assure you that i have a great variety of the finest prints and paintings and am master of a more curious set of nicknacks than are to be found in sir hans sloanes collection for as i constantly survey the windows of every printshop and attend every auction i look upon every curiosity as actually in my possession and you will agree with me that while i have the opportunity of seeing them the real owners cannot have more satisfaction in locking them up in cabinets and musaeums  you will conclude that the knowledge which i have thus picked out of the streets has been very extensive i have learned at every corner that the scurvy is a popular disease  that the bloody flux cannot be cured by any of the faculty except the gentlewoman at the blue posts in haydon yard  that nervous diseases were never so frequent  and that the royal family and most of our nobility are troubled with corns  and many other curious particulars of the same kind i have also got a smattering of the french language from the advertisements of tailors and staymakers and of mrs duboiss portable soop in french and english i was completely grounded in politics by stopping at temple bar every morning to read the gazzetteer which used to be pasted up there to the great emolument of the hackneycoachmen upon their stands but above all i have acquired the most sublime notions of religion by listening attentively to the spirited harangues of our most eminent fieldpreachers and i confess myself highly obliged to the itinerant missionaries of weslley whitefield and zinzendorf who have instructed us in the new light from empty barrels and jointstools next to these i have received great improvements from the vociferous retailers of poetry as i constantly used to thrust myself into the circle gathered round them and listen to their ditties till i could carry away both words and tune i have likewise got some notion of the drama by attending the theaters though my finances were too scanty for me ever to get admittance into them i therefore had recourse to the following practice i would contrive to hear one act at the outside of one of the pitdoors the next act i took my stand at the other and as the author generally rises in the middle i could catch the most tearing parts during the third act in the passage to the twoshilling gallery in the fourth act the rants came toleably loud to my ear at the entrance of the upper gallery and i very attentively listened to the pathetic at the conclusion of the play with the footmen in the lobby  endowed with so much learning you will doubtless be curious to know to what purposes i have turned it almost before i could read at all i got into the service of a very eminent doctor of physic who employed me in sticking up his bills and slipping them slily into the hands of spindleshanked young fellows as they passed by after this by closely studying these elegant compositions i got together a sufficient set of medical phrases which by the help of bayleys dictionary enabled me to draw up bills and affidavits for those doctors who were not so happy as to be able to write or read i was next promoted to the garret of a printer of bloody murders where my business was to invent terrible stories write yorkshire tragedies or christmas carrols and occasionally to put the ordinary of newgates account of dying speeches into lamentable rhyme i was afterward concerned in works that required a greater fund of erudition such as boghouse miscellanies and little books for children and i was once engaged as the principal compiler of a twopenny magazine since that i followed the occupation of an evesdropper or collector of news for the daily papers in which i turned a good penny by hunting after marriages and deaths and inventing lies for the day once indeed being out of other business i descended to the mean office of a balladsinger and hawked my own verses but not having a good ear for music and the tone of my voice being rather inclined to whining i converted my ballads into penitential hymns and took up the vocation of methodist preacher in this station i made new converts every day among the old women by my sighs and groans who in return contributed their halfpence which i disposed of in charity  to myself but i was at last beat off the field by a journeyman shoemaker who fairly outwhined me and finding myself deserted by my usual audience i became setter to a fleetparson  my employment now was to take my stand at the end of fleetmarket and whenever i saw any gaping young couple staring about them to whisper them softly in the ear and ask them whether they wanted to be married assuring them withal that ours was the only marriagebooth in the fair whenever the ceremony was performed i officiated as clerk and when my master the doctor died i made a shift to purchase his entire stock in trade consisting of a rusty cassock an old grizzle wig and one lappet of a band and succeeded him in his benefice of the handandpen chapel i now got a more comfortable subsistence than many regularly ordained curates in the country but the marriageact soon after taking place i was flung out of employ and as the primate of mayfair the reverend dr keith is forced to sell snuff in the fleetprison i have been obliged to retail gin in a nightcellar  thus mr town have i set before you the progress i have made in literature as well as the particular circumstances of my life in hopes they will induce you to the notice of the public as the parliament has not thought fit to make any provision for the poor distressed clergy of the fleet i intend to open a new oratorychapel in fleetmarket to be conducted on the same principles with that established in claremarket and for which i flatter myself i shall appear no less qualified by my education than the renowned henley or any of his butchers i shall therefore beg leave to subscribe myself hoping for your countenance and protection  your very humble servant orator higgins   the connoisseur by mr town

we are obliged to attend to the calls of nature and satisfy the regular cravings of the appetite though it is in truth but a very small part of the world that eat because they are hungry or drink because they are dry the common daylabourer may indeed be glad to snatch an hasty meal with his wife and children that he may have strength to return to his work and the porter finds it necessary to refresh himself with a full pot of entire butt while he rests his load upon the bulk at the alehouse door but those who have more leisure to study what they shall eat and drink require something more in their food than what is barely wholesome or necessary their palates must be gratified with rich sauces and highseasoned delicacies and they frequently have recourse to whetters and provocatives to anticipate the call of hunger and to enable their stomachs to bear the load they lay on it there are a sort of men whose chief pride is a good taste as they call it and a great stomach and the whole business of their lives is included in their breakfast dinner and supper these people of whatever rank and denomination whether they regale with turtle or devour shoulders of mutton and peckloaves for wagers whether a duke at whites or a chairman at the blueposts are certainly of the number of those whom nature as sallust tells us has made like the brutes obedient to their bellies and indeed partake in some measure of the sentence passed on the serpent to be cursed above all cattle and to go for ever on their bellies  there are many follies and vices which men endeavor to hide from the rest of the world but this above all others they take a pride in proclaiming and seem to run about with the cap and bells as if they were ambitious to be ranked among the sons of folly indeed as the politeness of the french language has distinguished every glutton by the title of bon vivant and the courtesy of our own has honored their beastly gluttony by the name of good living the epicure thinks to eat and drink himself into your good opinion and recommend himself to your esteem by an exquisite bill of fare however this may be it is remarkable that as the foxhunter takes delight in relating the incidents of the chase and kills the fox again over a bowl of punch at night so the bon vivant enjoys giving an account of a delicious dinner and chews the cud of reflection on such exquisite entertainment  i have been led into these thoughts by an acquaintance which i have lately made with a person whose whole conversation is literally speaking tabletalk his brain seems to be stuffed with an hodgepodge of ideas consisting of several dishes which he is perpetually serving up for the enterainment of the company as it was said of longinus that he was a walking library in the same manner i consider this gentleman as a walking larder and as the orations of demosthenes were said to smell of the lamp so my friends whole conversation savours of the kitchen he even makes use of his stomach as an artificial memory and recollects every place he has been at and every person he has seen by some circumstances relating to the entertainment he met with if he calls to mind any inn he adds for there the cook spoiled a fine turbot another house is recollected because the parson took all the fat of the haunch of venison he remembers a gentleman you mention because he had the smallest stomach he ever knew or one lady because she drank a great deal of wine at supper and another because she has the best receipt for making her pickled cucumbers look green  his passion for eating also influences all his actions diversions and studies he is fond of harehunting as he says his persuit is animated by the hopes of seeing puss smoking on the table but he wonders how any man can venture his neck in a chase after a fox which when it is got is not worth eating he has had occasion to visit the several wells in this kingdom which he considers not as places where persons go to drink the waters but where they go to eat and in this light he gives a character of them all  bath says he is one of the best markets in the world at tunbridge you have fine mutton and most exquisite wheatears but at cheltenham pox take the place you have nothing but cowbeef red veal and white bacon he looks upon every part of england in the same light and would as soon go to cheshire for butter and suffolk for cheese as miss eating what each particular town or county is famous for having the most excellent in its kind he does not grudge to ride twenty miles to dine on a favorite dish and it was but last week that he appointed a friend in buckinghamshire to meet him at uxbridge which says he in his letter is the best place we can settle our business at on account of those excellent rolls we may have for breakfast and the delicious trout we are sure to have at dinner  mr cramwell for that is his name is so unfortunate as to want a purse adequate to his taste so that he is put to several shifts and obliged to have recourse to several artifices to gratify his appetite for this purpose he has with great pains constituted a club consisting of persons most likely to promote good living this society is composed of members who are all of them of some trade that can furnish it with provisions except one country squire who supplies it with game and they are obliged to send in the best of whatever their trade deals in at prime cost by which wise management the club is supplied with every delicacy the seasons affords at the most reasonable rates upon any vacancy much care and deliberation is used in electing a new member a candidates being able to devour a whole turkey with an equal proportion of chine or eat one haunch of venison with the fat of another as sauce to it would be no recommendation on the contrary there was never more caution used at the death of a pope to elect a successor who appears the most likely to be shortlived than by this society of epicurean hogs to admit nobody of a stomach superior to their own mr cramwell on account of his extraordinary proficiency in the science of eating is honored with the office of caterer and has arrived to such a pitch of accuracy in the calculation of what is sufficient that he seems to gage the stomachs of the club as an exciseman does a cask and when all the members are present they seldom send away three ounces of meat from the table a captain of a ship trading to the west indies has been admitted an honorary member having contracted to bring over as a present to them a sufficient cargo of turtle every voyage and a few days ago i met cramwell in prodigious high spirits when he told me that he was the happiest man in the world for now says he we shall have ortolans as plenty as pigeons for it was but yesterday that we balloted into our society one of the flanderkinbirdmerchants this association for the preservation of elegant fare gratifies my friend cramwells luxury at a cheap rate and that he may make as many good meals as possible he often contrives to introduce himself to the tables of persons of quality this he effects by sending my lord or her ladyship a present of a bath cheese a ruff or landrail from his friends in lincolnshire or somersetshire which seldom fails to procure him an invitation to dinner it once happened that dining with an alderman his appetite got the better of his goodbreeding when he shaved off all the outside of a plumbpudding and he has ever since been talked of in the city by the name of skinpudding  as all his joy and misery constantly arises from his belly he thinks it is the same with others and i heard him ask a perfect stranger to him who complained that he was sick whether he had overeat himself it is no wonder that cramwell should be sometimes troubled with the gout i called upon him the other morning and found him with his legs wrapped up in flannel and a book lying open before him upon the table on asking him what he was reading he told me he was taking physic and on enquiring whose advice he had oh says he nobody can do me so much good as mrs hannah glass i am here going through a course of her art of cookery in hopes to get a stomach for indeed my dear friend added he with tears in his eyes my appetite is quite gone and i am sure i shall die if i do not find something in this book which i think i can eat  the connoisseur

error hor horace in the passage quoted at the head of my paper tells us after aristotle of a man who used to sit in the empty theater and fancy that he saw real exhibitions on the stage we have the like account in another ancient author of a person that used to wait with great solicitude the coming in of ships into the harbor believing them to be his own property the end of these madmen was also similar they were both cured and both complained that they were deprived of the satisfaction which they before enjoyed from a pleasing error of their minds  that the happiness and misery of the far greatest part of mankind depends upon the fancy need not be insisted on creed quod habes et babes think that you have and you have is a maxim not confined to those only within the walls of bedlam i remember an humourist who would frequently divert himself in the same manner with the madmen abovementioned and supply his real wants by the force of his imagination he would go round the markets and suppose himself to be cheapening the most dainty provisions and when he came home to his scanty meal by the same ideal contrivance he would convert his trotters into turbot and his small beer into the most delicious burgundy as he was a barber by trade he would put on the air and manners of his customers while he combed out their wigs with every bag he would conceive himself going to court or a ridotto and once when he was sick he got together three or four of the largest ties placed them upon blocks round his bedside and called them a consultation of physicians  but of all others there are none perhaps who are more obliged to the imagination for their ideal happiness than the fraternity of which i am an unworthy member there is no set of people who are more ambitious to appear grand in the world and yet have less means than those gentlemen whom the world has styled authors wit and pride as often go hand in hand together as wit and poverty but though the generality of writers are by the frowns of fortune debarred from possessing a profuse share of the good things of this world they are abundantly recompensed by enjoying them in speculation they indulge in golden dreams at the time that they have not sixpence in their pockets and conjure up all the luxuries of pontacs before them though they are at a loss perhaps where to get a dinner thus a critic by a kind of magic will transport himself to the theaters in an imaginary gilt chariot and be seated at once in the frontboxes when in reality he has waited for two hours in vinegaryard before the opening of the doors to secure to himself a corner in the twelvepenny gallery hence it also happens to most authors that though their way of life be ever so mean their writings favor of the most unbounded magnificence and as they have nothing to bestow a most surprising generosity always accompanies every action of the quill thus a novellist for example is remarkably lavish of his cash on all occasions and spares no expense in carrying on the designs of his personages through ever so many volumes nothing indeed is more easy than to be very profuse upon paper an author when he is about it may erect his airy castles to what height he pleases and with a wave of his pen may command the mines of peru and as he deals about his money without once untying his pursestrings it will cost him the same whether he throws away a mite or a million and another dip of ink by the addition of two or three gratis ciphers may in an instant convert a single ten into as many thousands we must not therefore be surprised that the heroes of our modern novels seem to possess the purse of fortunatus as their writers have all of them the power of his wishingcap  but it must be confessed that we essaywriters as we are the greatest egotists are consequently most vain and ostentatious as we frequently find occasion to prate about ourselves we take abundant care to put the reader constantly in mind of our importance it is very well known that we keep the best company are present at the most expensive places of diversion and can talk as familiarly of whites as if we had been admitted to the honor of losing an estate there though the necessaries as well as the luxuries of life may perhaps be denied us we readily make up for the want of them by the creative power of the imagination thus for instance i remember a brother essayist who took a particular pride in dating his lucubrations from my own apartment which he represented as abounding with every convenience though at the same time he was working three stories from the ground and was often forced to scribble upon wrappers of tobacco for want of other paper as to myself i make no doubt but the reader has long ago discovered without my telling him that i loll at my ease in a crimson velvet chair rest my elbow on the polished surface of a mahogany table write my essays upon gilt paper and dip my pen into a silver standish  indeed though i have

left us a description of their elegant villa i hope it will not be thought arrogance in me after what i have said if i set before the reader an account of my own study this is a little edifice situated at a small distance from the rest of the house for the sake of privacy and retirement it is an ancient pile of building and hangs over a small rivulet which runs underneath it and as the entrance into it is shaded by a thick hedge of evergreens which cast a kind of awful gloom about it some learned antiquarians have been led to conjecture that it was formerly a temple or rather chapel of ease dedicated to one of the heathen goddesses this goddess they inform me was worshipped by the romans and was probably held in no less veneration by the egyptians chaldees syrians and other nations however this be the walls on the inside are decorated with various inscriptions alluding to the religious rites performed there and hung round with the rude rhymes of ancient bards  to this study i retire constantly every morning after breakfast and at other parts of the day as occasions call here i am at liberty to indulge my meditations uninterrupted as i suffer no one to break in upon my privacy and what will perhaps surprise my readers i find in myself the greatest inclination to visit it after an hearty meal in this place i have made a very rapid progress in literature and have gone through several very learned volumes which otherwise i should never have looked into i have here traveled leaf by leaf through the works of many worthy but neglected ancient divines critics and politicians and have turned over many a modern pamphlet or poem with equal satisfaction i must not forget to mention that like the scrupulous mahometans i have often picked up the fragments of several learned writers which have come from the chandlers and lodged them among others no less valuable in my study  i may safely boast that i am indebted for many of my best thoughts in the course of these papers to the reflections i have had the leisure to make in this study which probably has the same influence on my mind as the stewed prunes which bays tells us he always took when he wrote but if my study serves to inspire me sometimes with agreeable ideas it never fails on the other hand to remind me of the mortality of writers as it affords repeated proofs that we may justly say of our works as

coming down to me but that she would be very glad to see me in the nursery as i knew she was a maiden lady i was a good deal startled at the message but however i followed the servant up stairs to her mistress whom i found combing a little white dog that lay in her lap with a gray parrot perched on one arm of the settee where she sat a monkey on the back and a tabby cat with half a dozen kittens in the other corner the whole room which was a very large one was indeed a nursery for all kinds of animals except those of the human species it was hung every where with cages containing parrots mackaws canary birds nightingales linnets goldfinches etc on the chairs were several cats reposing on soft cushions and there were little kennels in the chinese taste in almost every corner of the room filled with pugs fidos and king charless breed as soon as the chattering of the birds the barking of the dogs and the mewing of the cats which my entrance occasioned began to cease you find me here sir said

quarters of a year and cold not get the fellow to it ah bless it and love it sweet soul  and then she stroaked it and kissed it for near two minutes uttering the whole time all those inarticulate sounds which cannot be committed to paper and which are only addressed to dogs cats and children and may be styled the language of the nursery upon observing me smile at the embraces she bestowed on her little motley darling i am afraid said she you dont love these pretty creatures how can you be so cruel poor dumb things i would not have them hurt for all the world nor do i see why a lady should not indulge herself in having such sweet little company about her as well as you men run out estates in keeping a pack of filthy hounds then she laid pompey on his cushion by the fireside and railed at the barbarity of the human species to the rest of the creation and entered into a long dissertation on tenderness and humanity  a humane disposition is indeed so amiable either in man or woman that it ought always to be cherished and kept alive in our bosoms but at the same time we should be cautious not to render the first virtue of our nature ridiculous the most compassionate temper may be sufficiently gratified by relieving the wretches of our own species but who would ever boast of their generosity to a lapdog and their conferring eternal obligations on a monkey or would any person deserve to be celebrated for their charity who should deny support to a relation or a friend because he maintains a litter of kittens for my part before i would treat a dutch puppy with such absurd fondness i must be brought to worship dogs as the egyptians did of old and ever i would so extravagantly dote upon a monkey i would as iago says on a different occasion change my humanity with a baboon  yet there have been many instances besides my female friend of this fondness for the brute creation being carried to very ridiculous lengths the grave doctors of the faculty have been called in to feel the pulse of a lapdog and inspect the urine of a squirrel nay i am myself acquainted with a lady who carried this matter so far as to discharge her chaplain because he refused to bury her monkey but the most solemn piece of mummery on these occasions is the making provisions for these animals by will which absurd legacies as little deserve the title of humanity as those people merit being called charitable who in a deathbed fright starve their relations by leaving their estates to found an hospital it were indeed to be wished that money left in trust for such uses were subject to some statute of mortmain or at least that the gentlemen of the long robe would contrive some scheme to cut off the entail from monkeys mackaws italian greyhounds and tabby cats  that a stage coachman should love his cattle better than his wife and children or a country squire be fond of his hounds and hunters is not so surprising because the reason of their regard for them is easily accounted for and a seacaptain has upon the same principles been known to contract an affection for his ship but no coachman would like caligula tie his horses to a golden rack but thinks he shows sufficient kindness by filling them with good wholesome provender and the country sportsman takes care to provide his hounds with a good kennel and horseflesh but would never think of placing them on cushions before the fire and feeding them with fricasees or breed them with as much care as the heir to his estate this irregular passion if i may so call it is most frequently to be met with among the ladies how often has the slighted gallant envied the caresses given to a lapdog or kisses bestowed on a squirrel and i would i were thy bird has been the fond exclamation of many a romeo but it is remarkable that this affection for birds and beasts generally wears off after marriage and that the ladies discard their fourfooted darlings and feathered favorites when they can bestow their endearments on an husband wherefore these dry nurses to puggs and grimalkins are mostly to be met with among those females who have been disappointed in the affairs of love and have against their will retained the flower of virginity till it has withered in their possession it often happens that there is some kind of analogy between the gallant they once loved and the animal on which they afterward fix their affections and i myself remember an instance of a ladys passion for a lawyer being converted into dotage on a parrot and have an old maiden aunt who once languished for a beau whose heart is now devoted to a monkey  but i should not so much quarrel with these humane ladies who choose to settle their affections on the brute species if they were not troublesome to others who are not so sensible of the charms of a snub nose or can discover any beauty in the gray eyes of a cat a doting mother would never forgive you if you did not call her brat a fine child and dangle it about and prattle with it with as much seeming rapture as herself and in like manner a lady would take it as an affront to her own person if you did not pay your adresses equally to her pug or her parroquet i know a young fellow that was cut off with a shilling by an old maiden aunt because he gave poor veny a kick only for lifting up his leg against the gentlemans stocking and i have heard of another who might have carried off a very rich widow but that he could not prevail upon himself to extend his caresses to her dormouse indeed i cannot help thinking that the embraces and endearments bestowed on these rivals of the human species should be as private as the most secret intrigues and i would have lapdogs like fretful and squalling children confined to bark and growl only in the nursery we may often see a footman following his lady to church with a common prayer book under one arm a dog under the other i have also known a grave divine forced to stop short in the middle of a prayer while the whole congregation has been raised from their knees to attend to the howling of a lapdog and i once saw a tragedy monarch disturbed in his last moments as he lay expiring on the carpet by a little black dog of king charless breed who jumped out of the stagebox and seizing upon the heros perriwig brought it off in his mouth and lodged it in his ladys lap  it will not appear strange after what has been said that these ladies or ladylike gentlemen should be as sollicitous to preserve the breed of their favorite animals as a sportsman of his hounds and horses i have known a gentleman in st jamess street send his little cupid in a sedan chair as far as grosvenor square to wait upon a ladys veny for this very purpose and i shall never forget a card which was sent to another lady on a like occasion expressed in the following terms  mr  s compliments to lady betty  is glad to hear miss chloe is safely delivered and begs it as a particular favor that her ladyship would be pleased to set him down for a puppy  the connoisseur by mr town critic and censorgeneral number xc thursday october          ego nec studium sine divite vena nec rude quid prosit video ingenium  hor if we consider that part of our acquaintance whom we remember from their infancy we shall find that the expectations we once entertained of their future abilities are in many instances disappointed those who were accounted heavy dull boys have by diligence and application made their way to the first honors and become eminent for their learning and knowledge of the world while others who were regarded as bright lads and imagined to possess parts equal to any scheme of life have turned out dissolute and ignorant and quite unworthy the title of a genius except in the modern acceptance of the word by which it signifies a very silly young fellow who from his extravagance and debauchery has obtained the name of a genius like lucus a non lucendo because he has no genius at all  it is a shocking drawback from a fathers happiness when he sees his son blessed with strong natural parts and quick conception to reflect that these very talents may be his ruin if vanity once gets into his head and gives it a wrong turn the young coxcomb will neglect the means of improvement trust entirely to his native abilities and be as ridiculously proud of his parts as the brats of quality are taught to be of their family in the mean time those whom nature threw far behind him are by application enabled to leave him at a distance in their turn and he continues boasting of his genius till it subsists no longer but dies for want of cultivation thus vanity and indolence prevents his improvement and if he is to rise in the world by his merit takes away the means of success and perhaps reduces him to very miserable distresses i know one of these early geniuses who scarce supports himself by writing for a bookseller and another who is at leisure to contemplate his extraordinary parts in the fleetprison  if we look into the world we shall find that the mere genius will never raise himself to any degree of eminence without a close and unwearied application to his respective business or profession the inns of court are full of these men of parts who cannot bear the drudgery of turning over dry cases and reports but though they appear ever so eloquent in taverns and coffeehouses not the nearest relation will trust them with a brief and many a sprightly physician has walked on foot all his life with no more knowledge of his profession than what lies in his perriwig for whatever opinion they themselves may have of their own parts other persons do not choose to be bantered out of their estates or joked out of their lives and even in trade the plodding men of the alley would foretell the bankruptcy of any wit among them who should laugh at the labor of accounts or despise the italian method of bookkeeping thus we see that parts alone are not sufficient to recommend us to the good opinion of the world and even these if not roused and called forth by study and application would become torpid and useless as the racehorse though not put to drag a dray or carry a pack must yet be kept in exercise but i shall enlarge no further on this subject as i would not anticipate the thoughts contained in the following elegant little fable which as my correspondent informs me is written by the same ingenious hand that obliged the public with the verses on imitation inserted in my sixtyseventh number  the hare and the tortoise genius blessed term of meaning wide for sure no term so misapplied how many bear the sacred name that never felt a real flame proud of the specious appellation thus fools have christened inclination but yet suppose a genius true exempli gratia me or you whatever he tries with due intention rarely escapes his apprehension surmounting every opposition you would swear he learnt by intuition should he presume alone on parts and study therefore but by starts sure of success whenever he tries should he forego the means to rise suppose your watch a graham make gold if you will for value sake it is springs within in order due no watch when going goes so true if never wound up with proper care what service is it in the wear some genial spark of phoebus rays perhaps within our bosom plays o how the purer rays aspire if application fans the fire without it genius vainly tries however sometimes it seems to rise nay application will prevail when braggart parts and genius fail and now to lay my proof before ye i here present you with a story in days of yore when time was young when birds conversed as well as sung and use of speech was not confined merely to brutes of human kind a forward hare of swiftness vain the genius of the neighboring plain would often deride the drudging crowd for geniuses are ever proud his flight he would boast twere vain to follow for horse and dog he would beat them hollow nay if he put forth all his strength

october          utrumne divitiis homines an sint virtute beati et quae sit natura boni  hor to mr town sir the explanation which you gave us some time ago of good company has led me to consider the import and extent of the epithet good which in the modern sense of the word is indiscriminately applied to things very bad in their nature and is sometimes used only as a term of reproach  to begin first with what is called a good man by this one would imagine should be understood an honest virtuous and religious person but to look for a good man in this strict acceptance of the phrase among the men of fashion would be as vain a search as that of diogenes with his lanthorn in open daylight this appellation is indeed very familiarly used among the gentlemen of change alley but there it is meant only to signify a rich man he is there called a good man who is able to answer a bill at sight though he is known to be ever so great a cheat so by the same unaccountable phraseology a scoundrel with a large estate is entitled a man of worth as among rakes the honest fellow may be the most abandoned debauchee and greatest villain upon earth  by the same figure the good fellow is he who at a country wake can soil the best wrestler break most heads and challenge the ring take broughton by the nose bid defiance to the claremarket butchers knock down the constables and watch in beating the rounds in covent garden bilk the waiter and kick the bully out of doors in the hundreds of drury carry off his six bottles of port at a sitting or drink october till he leaves the country squire and the parson on the floor  as to the other sex the term good woman is applied as a mere expletive without any meaning to the poor only or perhaps to get rid of the importunity of a beggar in the country indeed a good lady is sometimes mentioned with a sneer or as a term of reproach and means one who is so oldfashioned as to go to church say her prayers and convert her dressing room into an apothecarys shop but i would ask any wellbred lady if she would be content to banish herself from the delights of the theater operahouse masquerades routs drums assemblies and the dear cardtable to be confined to the country have prayers in her own house twice a day and do charitable offices to her poor neighbors merely to acquire the ridiculous reputation of a good lady  i shall proceed next to consider what is generally understood by a good education this is not to be found in either of our universities nor is any learning or knowledge implied in it except what is called the knowledge of the world which cannot be attained among pedants or gathered from musty books common lads may be lashed through a grammar school and afterward locked up in colleges but young fellows of taste and spirit have better opportunities of improving themselves by mixing with the town and the beau monde for this reason they are introduced very early into those excellent seminaries of good education about covent garden and placed under the tuition of haddock douglass harris etc it is also necessary to ground them in the genteel principles of infidelity and freethinking that they should attend the disputations at the robin hood and the lectures of the claremarket orator and it would not be amiss if they were to get a little notion of the modern art of criticism by frequenting the bedford and georges coffeehouses after this it is proper to complete their education that they should make the tour of france and italy which will not fail to inspire them with the laudable love of every thing that is foreign and a thorough contempt for their own country nothing now remains but to instruct them in the noble science of gaming for which purpose it has been found expedient to constitute an academy at whites where it is taught in all it is branches the consequences of such a good education as is here set down may be seen in many instances some have been enabled by it to ruin their constitutions and others to run out their estates some have received the finishing stroke of a good education at tyburn while others have given sufficient proofs of it by being gallantly run through the body in a duel or genteelly shooting themselves through the head  let us now take a view of the good education which is at present in vogue among the fair sex as the good ladies of former days were desirous that their daughters should make good wives they thought the first step toward it was to make them good housewives they therefore bred them up in the domestic arts of pickling preserving distilling simple waters and the like they also taught them to work at their needle write cast accounts and read a chapter in the bible or some other good book as they are ridiculously oalled but this method of education has been found to be fit only for low girls designed to go to service or poor parsons daughters that must come to be milliners or something worse as to ladies of fashion to learn english would only obstruct their advancement in the french language which they are taught to speak from their infancy but never to read besides they will get a better knowledge of their mother tongue from the peculiar dialects used at routes and assemblies and the spirited conversations carried on at masquerades and other public places than they could possibly do from books all the writing required is to be able to scrawl out a billetdoux for which we must also own that spellingbooks are of no service and working we know would hurt their eyes no less than reading as to religion honor virtue charity and the like oldfashioned cant nobody would think of stuffing any girls head with it above the degree of a chambermaid  the present notion of a good education was therefore unknown to the females of former ages as besides the usual accomplishments of dancing or the like it will be found to consist in the knowledge of intriguing dress and i may add too the cardtable in the first of these particulars they constantly receive lessons from the milliners mantuamakers and maidservants and by being carried about to all public places of diversion they soon become proficients in the sciences the same tutors likewise take care to instruct their young pupils in the art of dress and i have known a little miss by the time she was arrived at her teens so nice an adept in facepainting as to apply the rouge to her pretty cheeks with as much elegance and propriety as her mamma to conclude when a young lady has got hoyles rules by heart and is qualified to play a rubbers at a sunday route it is a sure mark of her having had a complete good education  there are many other instances in which this word good is perverted to a very preposterous sense thus good living is made to signify the practice of no other excellence but what consists in good eating and drinking but as you have formerly given us the character of one of these good livers i shall only take notice that the ill humors consequent of their luxury and intemperance which show themselves in blotches and breakings out on their faces are emphatically called their goodness in like manner by good blood we are taught to understand a gentility of birth and though a nobleman be ever so notorious for his vices or though his ancestors have been raised by the vilest means his posterity always pride themselves on the good blood of the family i would not be thought to quibble about words when i observe that the most shocking and blasphemous ridicule on the sacred tenets of our religion though without the least shadow of wit is by the present shallow race of freethinkers applauded as a good joke the most cruel and unmanly actions are by our bucks and bloods set down under the same denomination and if blasphemy and profaneness is a good joke a rape or a murder is upon the same pinciples esteemed a very good thing  i am sir your humble servant philagathus   the connoisseur by mr town critic and censorgeneral number xcii thursday october  0      o nata mecum consule manlio seu tu querelas sive geris jocos seu rixam et insanos amores seu facilem pia testa somnum descend  hor drinking is one of those popular vices which most people reckon among their venial failings and it is thought no great blot on a mans character to say he takes his glass rather too freely but as those vices are most dangerous and likely to prevail which if not approved are at least excused by most people i have been tempted to examine whether drinking really deserves that quarter it receives from the generality of mankind and i must own that after a strict attention to the principal motives that induce men to become harddrinkers as well as to the consequences which such excesses produce i am at a loss to account for the received maxim that in good wine there is truth and should no more expect happiness in a full bowl than chastity in the bar of a tavern  the incentives to this practice are some of them very shocking and some very ridiculous as will perhaps appear from the following characters poor heartly was blessed with every noble qualification of the head and heart and bade fair for the love and admiration of the world but was unfortunately bound in a very large sum for a friend who disappeared and left him to the mercy of the law the distresses thus brought upon him by the treachery of another threw him into the deepest despair and he had at last recourse to drinking to benumb if possible the very sense of reflection he is miserable when sober and when drunk stupefied and muddled his misfortunes have robbed him of all the joys of life and he is now endeavoring wilfully to put an end to them by a slow death  tom buck from the first day that he was put into breeches was always accounted a boy of spirit and before he reached the top of westminster school knew the names and faces of the most noted girls upon town tossed off his claret with a smack and had a long tick at the tavern when he went to oxford he espoused the tory party because they drank deepest and he has for some years been accounted a fourbottle man he drank for fame and has so well established his character that he was never known to send a man from his chambers sober but generally laid his whole company under the table since his leaving the university nobody ever acquired more reputation by electioneering for he can see out the stoutest freeholder in england he has indeed swallowed many a tun in the service of his country and is now a sounder patriot by two bottles than any man in the county  poor woudbe became a debauchee through mere bashfulness and a foolish sort of modesty that has made many a man drunk in spite of his teeth he contracted an acquaintance with a set of hard drinkers and though he would as soon choose to swallow a dose of physic has not courage to refuse his bumper he is drunk every night and always sick to death the next morning when he constantly resolves to drink nothing stronger than small beer for the future but at night the poor fellow gets drunk again through downright modesty thus woudbe suffers himself to be pressed into the service and since he has commenced a jolly fellow is become one of the most miserable wretches upon earth  honest ned brimmer is at present the most dismal object that ever fell a sacrifice to liquor it was unluckily his first ambition to promote what is usually called good fellowship in this undertaking he has in a very few years entirely ruined his constitution and now stalks up and down in so piteous a condition as might inspire his companions with more melancholy reflections than an empty bottle he has quite lost all appetite and he is now obliged to keep up a weak artificial heat in his body by the same means that destroyed the natural warmth of his constitution rum brandy and usquebaugh are his dietdrinks and he may perhaps linger a few months before he falls a martyr to good fellowship  having thus taken a short view of the unhappy motives that induce men to become harddrinkers few perhaps will think such reasons any recommendation to drunkenness nor can i imagine they will grow more fond of it by observing what strange creatures they are during their intoxication shakespeare calls it putting a devil into their mouths to steal away their brains and indeed a cup too much turns a man the wrong side out and wine at the same time it takes away the power of standing from the legs deprives the mind of all sense and reflection it is whimsical enough to consider the different effects which wine produces on different tempers sometimes like love it makes a fool sensible and a wise man an ass and seems to imbibe a new quality from every different body as water takes a tincture from the ground it runs through  horace has with great pleasantry recapitulated the various effects of wine in a stanza which i have placed at the head of this paper one man grows maudlin and weeps another becomes merry and facetious a third quarrels throws a bottle at his companions head and could run his dearest friend through the body a fourth is mad for a girl and falls in love with a streetwalker or an old woman roasting chestnuts while to a fifth the liquor serves as an opiate and lulls him to sleep shakespeare has also shown this variety of characters with great humor cassio cries let us to business and immediately begins to hiccup out his prayers and belches out his hopes of salvation justice silence who does not speak a word while he is sober has no sooner swallowed the rouzing cup than he roars out a catch and grows the noisiest man in the company it is reported to have been one of the most exquisite entertainments to the choice spirits in the beginning of this century to get addison and steel together in company for the evening steel entertained them till he was tipsy when the same wine that stupefied him only served to elevate addison who took up the ball just as steel dropped it and kept it up for the rest of the evening they who have never been present at a scene of this kind may see the whole group of drunken characters displayed at one view with infinite humor in hogarths modern midnight conversation  thus excess of drinking verifies all the transformations recorded in the fable of circes cup and perhaps the true reason why bacchus is always painted with horns is to intimate that wine turns men into beasts indeed if none were to indulge themselves in drinking except those who like steel and addison could be witty and agreeable in their cups the number of harddrinkers would be very happily diminished most men have so little right to plead an excuse of this sort in vindication of their drunkenness that wine either makes them very rude very stupid or very mad it is a vulgar error to suppose that liquor only shows ill qualities since it also frequently creates them and engenders notions in the mind quite foreign to its natural disposition which are the mere effects of wine and break out like blotches and carbuncles on the face the disgustful appearance which most people make when they are drunk was what induced the spartans to intoxicate their slaves and show them to their children in order to deter them from so odious a vice in like manner let the choice spirit who is often seen hanging his head over the pot or snoring in an armedchair in a tavern reflect what a shocking figure he must have made when he sees the drunken beggar sleeping on a bulk or rolling in the kennel  whoever thus considers the motives that generally induce men to give into these excesses and how ridiculous and unhappy they are often rendered by the effects will hardly be tempted by the charms of a bottle and indeed harddrinking is frequently one among the many evils that arise from want of education the dull squire settled in the country who has no taste for literary amusements has nothing except his dogs and horses but his bumper to divert him and the town squire fits soaking for the same reasons in a tavern these are the common herd of bacchuss swine but nothing is more shocking than to see a man of sense thus destroying his parts and constitution it not only makes a terrible innovation in his whole frame and intellects but also robs him of the society of those like himself with whom he should associate and reduces him to the level of a set of wretches since all may be admitted to his company and conversation who are able to toss off a bumper  these considerations are sufficient to convince us of the evils which result from harddrinking but it will shock us still more if we reflect how much it will influence our life and conduct whoever is engaged in a profession will never apply to it with success while he sticks so close to his bottle and the tradesman who endeavors to make business and pleasure compatible will never be able to make both ends meet thus whether health fame or interest is regarded drunkenness should be avoided and we may say with cassio every inordinate cup is unblest and the ingredient is a devil  the connoisseur by mr town critic and censorgeneral number xciii thursday november        fortuna saevo laeta negotio et ludum insolentem ludere pertinax hor i cannot but admire the ingenious device prefixed to the advertisements of hazards lotteryoffice in which fortune is represented hovering over the heads of a number of people and scattering down all kinds of prizes among them what mr hazard has here delineated every adventurer in the late lottery had pictured to himself the ten thousand constantly floated before his eyes and each person had already possessed it in imagination but alas all our expectations are now at an end the golden dream is at length vanished and those who were kept giddy all the while that the wheel of fortune was turning round have now leisure soberly to reflect on their disappointment how many unhappy tradesmen must now trudge on foot all their lives who designed to loll in their chariots how many poor maidens of good family but no fortune must languish all their days without the comforts of an husband and a coach and fix every loser thinks himself ill used by fortune and even mrs betty the possessor of a single sixteenth flies to the office pays her penny and receives the tidings of her ill luck with surprise goes to another office pays her penny hears the same disagreeable information and can hardly very hardly persuade herself that fortune should have doomed her still to wash the dishes and scrub down the stairs  thus the views of every adventurer are directed to the same point though their motives for engaging in the lottery may be different one man puts in because he is willing to be in fortunes way another because he had good luck in the last and another because he never got any thing before this indulges in the prospect of making a fortune and that buoys himself up with the hopes of retrieving his desperate circumstances every one however thinks himself as sure of the ten thousand as if he had it in his pocket and his only concern is how to dispose of it in this light we may consider every adventurer as having been in actual possession of this treasure and out of fifty thousand people who have been blessed within this fortnight with such ideal good fortune i shall select the following instances which fell within my own notice  joseph wilkins of thames street esquire oilman and cheesemonger got the  0000 l he could not bear the foggy air and dingy situation of the city he therefore resolved to take an house at the st jamess end of the town and intended to fit up a snug box at hampstead in the chinese taste for his retirement on sundays a chariot was absolutely necessary to carry him to and from change every morning but he designed to have it made according to the modern fashion that it might occasionally be converted into a postchaise to wheel him on a saturday night to his countryseat and back again on the monday morning nothing was now wanting but a careful plodding partner who should take upon himself the whole drudgery of the shop so that the squire might have no farther trouble than to receive his dividend of the profits but while he was considering on whom this important favor should be conferred his ticket was drawn  blank and squire wilkins is contented with his greasy employment of measuring out lampoil and cutting out pennyworths of cheshire cheese  john jones of ludlow in the county of salop esquire dealer and chapman got the  0000 l this gentleman was forewarned of his success by several undeniable tokens his lady had dreamt of a particular number four nights together and while the bells were ringing upon his being chose bailiff of the corporation they spoke in as plain words as ever whittington heard  mr john jones will get ten thousand pound  mr john jones will get ten thousand pound he and his lady therefore came up to london and not being able to meet with the particular number at hazards or wilsons or any other office always remarkable for selling the ten thousands they advertized it in the papers and got the great prize for only paying a guinea more for their ticket than the marketprice as mrs jones knew a good deal of the world having lived for some years in quality of an upper servant in a great house she was determined that mr jones should take the opportunity now they were in town of learning how to behave himself as he should do when he came to his fortune she therefore introduced him into the best company in all the housekeepers and stewards rooms in the best families where she was acquainted and as mr jones was so deficient in politeness as not even to know how to make a bow in coming into a room he had private lessons from mr dukes who undertakes to teach grown gentlemen to dance mrs jones herself was very busy in consulting with the milliner and mantuamaker about the newest fashions when the long lookedfor ten thousand came up and directly after the heygeho carried them down again to salop with this only consolation that their ticket was within one of the fortunate number  jonathan wildgoose of cheapside silk mercer had too much taste to be confined to dirty business which he neglected for the more agreeable persuits of pleasure having therefore met with great losses in trade he was obliged to embark the remains of his shattered fortune in the lottery and by purchasing a number of tickets secured to himself the  0000 l he had determined to keep his success secret bilk his creditors by becoming bankrupt turn the whole into an annuity for his life and live abroad like a gentleman upon the income but unluckily his creditors came upon him too quickly and before he could know that he had not got the ten thousand hurried him to jail where he now lies lamenting that the act of insolvency was not postponed till after the lottery  sir humphry oldcastle having greatly dipped his estate by being chosen into parliament on the tory interest mortgaged all he had left to put himself in the way of the the  0000l for the good of his country this seasonable recruit fixed him a staunch patriot and he declared he would stand another election against all oppositions but however it happened the finishing of the lottery has induced him to change his sentiments and sir humphry in lieu of the  0000 l has accepted a place  jemmy lister an attorneys clerk was carried into the lottery by pure disinterested love he had conceived a violent passion for his masters daughter but the prudent old gentleman could not be prevailed on to give her away to an handsome young fellow without a penny this enraged him so much that he was in doubt whether he should bestow his  0000 l on the young lady or employ it more fashionably in keeping a girl however his hopes soon sunk to one of the  000 l prizes which he at once determined to settle upon her together with his person but in this too he was disappointed as also of the other inferior prizes and having received a positive refusal from his mistress out of mere spite he directly married the maid  captain mac mullen a decayed gamester made a shift to purchase the chance of a ticket which came up  0000l he immediately flew to arthurs late whites risked it all at hazard set the whole table and stripped the company of their last shilling after this he bought runninghorses made matches carried off the best plates and took in all the knowingones on the turf but so fluctuating is the situation of a gamester that at the end of the lottery he found that fortune had left him in the lurch without so much as a groat to buy an halter et frustra mortis cupidum cum deerit egenti as laquei pretium  hor  i need not point out any particular instances among the other sex with respect to their disposal of the  0000 l which every lady had secured by choosing the ticket herself taking particular care that the number be an odd one the married ladies have sufficient calls for even double this sum to supply them with the necessaries of dress and to answer the expenses of frequenting public diversions and as to the unmarried ladies they very well know the truth of that maxim in the ballad that in ten thousand pounds ten thousand charms are centered some ancient maiden ladies who could never be brought to think of an husband or to give into the vanities of the world were resolved to live retired upon their prize in the country and leave proofs of their good dispositions behind them by swelling out their wills with a long list of items to this or that charity or hospital  before i conclude i cannot but take notice of the great generosity of my own publisher upon getting the  0000 l as his success was owing to his laying out in the lottery all the profits which had already risen from the publication of this paper he had determined to circulate my future numbers gratis and had even designed to keep open house for the reception of poor authors unhappily for the public as well as my brotherwriters fortune has frustrated his disinterested scheme even i myself am admitted

pleased to hear the following   there you see the british fleet persuing the french ships which are running away  there you see major general johnson beating the french soldiers in america and taking count dieskau prisoner  there you see the grand monarque upon his knees before king george begging his life as the thoughts of the public are now wholly turned upon war it is no wonder that every method is taken to inspire us with a love of our country and an abhorrence of the french king and not only the old seaman with his rareeshow but the public theaters have likewise had a view to the same point at drury lane we have already been entertained with the humors of the navy and i am assured that at covent garden mr barry will make an entire conquest of france in the person of that renowned hero henry the fifth and as the english are naturally fond of bloody exhibitions on the stage i am told that a new pantomime entitled the ohio is preparing at this last house more terrible than any of it is hells devils and fiery dragons in which will be introduced the indian manner of fighting to conclude with a representation of the grand scalping dance with all its horrors  while this warlike disposition prevails in the nation i am under some apprehensions lest the attention of the public should be called off from the weighty concerns of these papers i already perceive that the common newspapers are more eagerly snatched up in the public coffeehouses than my essays and the gazette is much oftener called for than the connoisseur for these reasons i find it necessary to lay open my own importance before the public to show that i myself am acting as it were in a military capacity and that censorgeneral town has done his country no less service as a valiant and skilful commander at home than major general johnson in america authors may very properly be said to be engaged in a state of literary warfare many of whom are taken into pay by those great and mighty potentates the booksellers and it will be allowed that they undergo no less hardships in the service than the common soldiers who are contented to be shot at for a groat a day  it has been my province to repel the daily inroads and encroachments made by vice and folly and to guard the nation from an invasion of foreign fopperies and french fashions the town has been principally the scene of action where i have found enemies to encounter with no less formidable than the tquattotquaws or the chickchimuckchis of north america but as the curiosity of the public is so much engaged in attending to the enterprises of old hendrick the sachem and the incursions of indians who have taken up the hatchet against our colonies i am afraid that my exploits against the savages which infest this metropolis will be wholly overlooked i have therefore resolved to give my readers fresh advices from time to time of what passes here drawn up in the same warlike style and manner as those very alarming articles of news which are commonly to be met with in our public papers  we hear from whites that the forces under major general hoyle which used to encamp at that place are removed from thence and have fixed their winter quarters at arthurs the same letters say that an obstinate engagement was fought there a few nights ago in which one party gained a great booty and the other suffered a considerable loss we are also informed that an epidemical distemper rages among them and that several of the chiefs have been carried off by a sudden death  they write from covent garden that last week a body of irregulars sallied out at midnight stormed several forts in that neighborhood and committed great outrages but being attacked by a detachment from the allied army of watchmen constables and justices they were put to flight and several of them taken prisoners the plague still rages there with great violence as well as in the neighboring territories of drury  we hear from the same place that the company commanded by brigadier rich has been reinforced with several newraised recruits to supply the place of some deserters who had gone over to the enemy but his chief dependence is on the lightarmed troops which are very active and are distinguished like the highlanders by their partycolored dress the enemy on the other hand have taken several swiss and germans into pay though they were at first under terrible apprehensions of their being set upon by the critics these are a rude ignorant savage people who are always at war with the nation of authors their constant manner of fighting is to begin the onset with strange hissings and noises accompanied with an horrid instrument named the catcall which like the warhoop of the indians has struck a panic into the hearts of the stoutest heroes  we have advice from the butcher row that on monday night last the infidels held a grand council of war at their head quarters in the robin hood at which their good friend and ally the mufti of claremarket assisted in person after many debates they resolved to declare war against the christians and never to make peace till they had pulled down all the churches in christendom and established the alcoran of bolingbroke in lieu of the bible  all our advices from the city of london agree in their accounts of the great havoc and slaughter made there on the festival commonly called my lord mayors day all the companies in their black uniform and the trained bands in their regimentals made a general forage they carried off vast quantities of chickens geese ducks and all kinds of provisions major guzzledown of bassishaw distinguished himself greatly having with sword in hand gallantly attacked the outworks scaled the walls mounted the ramparts and forced through the covertway of a large fortified custard which seemed impregnable  the inhabitants of sussex have lately been alarmed with the apprehensions of an invasion as the french have been very busy in fitting out several small vessels laden with stores of wine and brandy with which it is thought they will attempt to make a descent somewhere on our coasts the independent companies of smugglers in the service of france are to be sent on this expedition but if the fleet of customhouse smacks etc do not intercept them at sea we are preparing to receive them as soon as they are landed  from diverse parts of the country we have advice that the roads are every where crowded with ladies who notwithstanding the severity of the weather are hurrying up to london to be present at the meeting of the female parliament at this critical juncture the fate of the nation depends entirely on the deliberations of this wise and august assembly and as there are known to be many disinterested patriots in the house it is not to be doubted but that proper measures will be persued for the good of their country many salutary laws are already talked of which we could wish to see put in execution such as  a bill for prohibiting the importation of french milliners haircutters and mantuamakers  a bill for the exportation of french cooks and french valets de chambres  a bill to restrain ladies from wearing french dresses  and lastly a bill to restrain them from wearing french faces  the connoisseur by mr town critic and censorgeneral number xcv thursday november  0      melle soporatam et medicatis frugibus offam objicit  virg as every marriage is a kind of family festival the wedding day is honored with various celebrities and distinguished like the fifth of november the birthdays of the royal family or any other public day with many demonstrations of joy the happy couple are dressed in their richest suits the bells ring all day and the evening is concluded with the merry ceremony of throwing the stocking but these festivities are not always so religiously observed in town where many a pair of quality are tacked together with the utmost privacy and immediately after sneak out of town as if they were ashamed to show their faces after what they had done in the country when the squire or any other person of distinction is married the honeymoon is almost a continued carnival and every marriage is accounted more or less likely to be prosperous in proportion to the number of deer oxen and sheep that are killed on the occasion and the hogsheads of wine and tuns of ale with which they are washed down by the last post i received an account from my cousin village of the wedding of a near relation with a particular detail of the magnificence of the entertainment the splendour of the ball and the universal joy of the whole manor at the same time i received compliments from the newmarried couple with a large slice of the bridecake the virtues of which are well known to every girl of thirteen i was never in possession of this nuptial charm before but i was so much delighted with this matrimonial token and it excited in my mind so many reflections on conjugal happiness that though i did not lay it under my pillow it gave occasion to the following dream  i found myself in the middle of a spacious building which was crowded with a variety of persons of both sexes and upon enquiry was told that it was the temple of the god of marriage and that every one who had an inclination to sacrifice to that deity was invited to approach a large altar which was covered with a great number of cakes of different shapes and appearance some of these were molded into the form of hearts and others were woven into trueloversknots some were strewed with sugar and stuck about with sweetmeats some were covered with gold some were stamped with coronets and others had their tops embellished with glittering toys that represented a fine house a set of jewels a coach and six or the like plutus and cupid were busily employed in distributing these cakes which were all of them marked with the word matrimony and called bridecakes to different persons who were allowed to choose for themselves according to their different views and inclinations  i observed several hasten to the altar who all appeared to be differently affected by their choice to some the cakes seemed of so delicious a flavor that they imagined they should never be surfeited while others who found the taste very agreeable at first in a short time declared it to be flat and insipid however i could not help remarking that many more particularly among the quality addressed themselves to plutus than to cupid  being desirous to take a nearer view of the company i pushed through the crowd and placed myself close by the altar a young couple now advanced and applying to cupid desired him to reach them one of the cakes in the shape of a double heart pierced through with darts but just as they were going to share it betwixt them a crabbed old fellow whom i found to be the girls father stepped up broke the cake in two and obliged the young lady to fix upon another which plutus picked out for her and which represented the figure of a fine gentleman in gilt gingerbread  an old fellow of sixtytwo who had stolen one day from the business of the change and the alley next came toward the altar and seemed to express a strong desire for a cake plutus who recollected him at first sight immediately offered him one which though very moldy and coarse was gilt all over but he was astonished at the old gentlemans refusing it and petitioning cupid for a cake of the most elegant form and sweetest ingredients of any on the altar the little god at first repulsed him with indignation but afterward sold it to him for a large sum of money a circumstance which amazed me beyond expression but which i soon found was very commonly practiced in this temple the old fellow retired with his purchased prize and though i imagined he might still have a colts tooth remaining after having for some time mumbled it between his old gums in vain it lay by him untouched and unenjoyed  i was afterward very much disgusted with the many instances that occurred of these delicate morsels being set up to sale and i found that their price rose and fell like that of beef or mutton according to the glut or scarcity of the market i was particularly affected with the disposal of the two following a young gentleman and lady were approaching the altar and had agreed to take between them a cake of a plain form but delicious flavor marked love and competence but a person of quality stepping forward persuaded the false female to join with him and receive from plutus a glittering dainty marked indifference and a large settlement another lady was coming up with a knight of the bath being tempted by a cake with a red ribbon streaming from it like the flags on a twelfthcake but was prevailed on by a person of greater rank and distinction to accept a more showy cake adorned with a blue ribbon and a coronet  a buxom dame of an amourous complexion came next and begged very hard for a cake she had before received several which suited her tooth and pleased her palate so excessively that as soon as she had dispatched one she constantly came to cupid for another she now seized her cake with great transport and retiring to a corner with it i could discern her greedily mumbling the delicious morsel though she had fairly worn out six and twenty of her teeth in the service after this an ancient lady came tottering up to the altar supported by a young fellow in a red coat with a shoulderknot plutus gave him a stale cake marked with the word jointure in large golden capitals which he received with some reluctance while the old lady eagerly snatched another from cupid who turned his head aside from her on which i could plainly discover the word dotage  a rich rusty bachelor of the last century then came bustling through the crowd he brought with him a redcheeked country girl of nineteen as he approached the altar he met several coming from it with cakes which he had refused some of which were marked riches some family some beauty and one or two affection the girl he brought with him proved to be his dairymaid whom he had for some time past been in vain attempting to bring over to his wishes but at last finding his design impracticable he came with her to the altar he seemed indeed a little ashamed of his undertaking and betrayed a good deal of aukwardness in his manner and deportment however as soon as he had taken his cake he retired and determined to spend the rest of his days with his milchcow in the country  to satisfy a modest longing there now advanced a maiden lady in the bloom of threescore she had it seems heretofore refused several offers from cupid and plutus but being enraged to find that they had now given over all thoughts of her she seized by the hand a young ensign of the guards and carried him to the altar whence she herself snatched up a cake and divided it with her gallant she was highly delighted with the taste of it at first but her partner being very soon cloyed she too late discovered that the half which she held in her hand was signed folly and that which she had forced upon her paramour was marked aversion  a little pert forward miss in a frock and hanging sleeves briskly ran up to cupid and begged for a cake what it was she did not care but a cake she must and would have of one kind or another she had just stretched out her hand to receive one from cupid when her mamma interposed sent the child back again blubbering to the boardingschool and carried off the cake herself  an old woman fantastically dressed then burst into the temple and run raving up to the altar crying out that her name was mary singleton and she would have an husband but the poor lady seemed likely to be disappointed for as she could prevail on no one to join hands with her both cupid and plutus refused to favor her with a cake furious with rage and despair she snatched one off the altar and seizing on the first man that came in her way which unfortunately happened to be myself she would have crammed it forcibly down my throat as the least crumb of it was as disagreeable as a drench to an horse i began to spawl and sputter and keck and though the flurry of spirits which it occasioned awaked me i thought i had the nauseous taste of it still in my mouth  the connoisseur by mr town critic and censorgeneral number xcvi

sciet quisquam mart to mr town sir among the many register offices erected within these few years past i am surprised that no scheme of the like nature has been thought of for the service of literature and that no place has been set apart where literary commodities of every sort might be disposed of where men of learning might meet with employment and where others who want their assistance might be sure to meet with men of learning there is nothing of this kind in being at present except among the booksellers who have made a monopoly of the trade and engrossed the whole market to themselves to remedy this inconvenience my design is to set up a literary register office for which purpose i intend to hire the now useless theater in lincolns inn fields and convert it into a mart for the staple commodities of the literary commonwealth i shall here fit up apartments for the reception of my authors who will be employed from time to time in supplying the public with the requisite manufactures this scheme will i doubt not meet with great encouragement as it is of general utility and i do not remember any design of the same nature except at a barbers on the other side the water who has hung out a board over his shop with the following inscription  letters read and written for servants and others  i shall always have a fresh assortment of goods in the best taste and newest fashion as of novels for example while the humor of reading them is prevalent among all ranks of people for this branch i shall retain a very eminent masternovellist to cut out adventures and intrigues and shall employ a proper number of hands to finish the work with all possible care and expedition and if any ladies of quality or others choose to furnish their own materials for memoirs and apologies they may have them done up and be fitted exactly at my office besides several others which my men shall get up with the greatest dispatch i can assure you i have myself worked night and day and have already finished six and thirty sheets of the history of miss sukey sapling written by herself  pamphlets of all sorts shall be composed whenever any popular subject starts up that is likely to engage the attention of the public every new play shall be followed by an examen or remarks all riots at either playhouse will afford scope for letters to the managers and every new actor or actress produce theatrical criticisms poetry you know mr town is a mere drug but i shall always have a number of readymade odes by me which may be suited to any great man dead or alive in place or out of place i shall also have a large bundle of poems on several occasions very proper for any gentleman or lady who chooses to publish by subscription besides a more ordinary sort of hymns to the morning verses on the death of  odes to miss a b c acrostics and rebusses for the use of the magazines to be sold a pennyworth with allowance to those who take a great quantity  with regard to law matters as they have no sort of connection with wit or learning i shall not concern myself with their unintelligible jargon nor presume to interfere with those authors in parchment who measure their words by the footrule and sell their writings at so much per line however i shall furnish young students of the several inns of court with complete canons of criticism and opinions on any new theatrical cases on which they may argue very learnedly at a tavern or plead at the bar of a coffeehouse for medical subjects i shall procure a learned graduate by diploma from abroad whose practice will not so much take up his time as to prevent his being at leisure to write occasional treatises setting forth the virtues of any newlyinvented powder or newlydiscovered water he shall also draw up the advertisements for medicines that remove all diseases and are never known to fail he shall compile the wonderful accounts of their surprising cures and furnish cases that never happened and affidavits that were never made with respect to divinity as i have reason to believe that controversial writings will be often called for i intend to bargain with the robin hood society to undertake in the lump to furnish my office with defenses of lord bolingbroke etc and till i can procure some poor curate out of the country or servitor from the university to write the manuscript sermons of eminent divines lately deceased warranted originals i must make shift with the fleet parsons now out of business  though i shall not keep any dramatic works ready made by me as these commodities are apt to grow stale and out of fashion yet either of the theaters may be served with tragedy comedy farce or the like by bespeaking them and giving but three days notice for the comic pieces i shall employ a poet who has long worked for the drolls at bartholomew and southwark fairs and has printed a comedy as it was half acted at drury lane my tragedies will be furnished by a north briton who walked up to london from his native country last winter with a most sublime tragedy in his coatpocket and which is now to be disposed of to the best bidder any old play of shakespeare or ben johnson shall be pieced with modern ones according to the present taste or cut out in airs and recitative for an english opera rhymes for pantomimes may be had to be set to the clack of a mill the tinkling of a tin cascade or the slaps of harlequins wooden sword the proprietors of our public gardens during the summer season may be also supplied from my office with lovesongs to a new burden or comic dialogues in crambo and words shall at any time be fitted to the music after the tunes are composed  as i propose to make my office of general utility every thing that bears the least affinity to literature will be naturally comprehended in my scheme members of parliament may be supplied with speeches on any political subject and country justices may on directing a letter to the office post paid have charges to the jury at the quarter sessions sent down to them by the first coach or wagon addresses on particular occasions shall be drawn up for the worshipful mayor and aldermen of any

cards and invitations to routs shall be filled up and circulated at so much per hundred or undertaken in the gross at a fixed price all the year round beaux may be accommodated with letters of gallantry to send to their laundresses or have them copied out in a fashionable female scrawl and directed to themselves which they may show about as coming from ladies of quality in love with them gentlemen who love fighting but cannot write may have challenges penned for them in the true style and spirit of a modern blood  there are many other conveniences arising from such an office which it would be too tedious to enumerate and it will be found to be no less beneficial to you authors mr town than those other register offices are to men and maidservants if an author for example wants employment or is out of place he has nothing to do but to enter his name with me and i shall presently get him work or if a bookseller wants an hand for any particular job as a translationspinner a

procured at a minutes warning by applying to my office and i dare say you yourself mr town will be very glad now and then to purchase a connoisseur of me whenever the idle fit seizes you if that

amici hor i remember to have heard a cousin of mine who was formerly at cambridge often mention a sect of philosophers distinguished by the rest of the collegians by the appellation of tufthunters these were not the disciples of the stoics or epicureans or the advocates for the old or new philosophy but the followers literally speaking of the fellowcommoners noblemen and other rich students whom it seems the courtesy of the university has honored with a cap adorned with a gold tossel these few gold threads have almost as much influence in the university as a red or blue ribband at court and always draw after the wearer a train of humble companions who will be at his call to breakfast dine or sup with him whenever he pleases will go with him any where drink with him wench with him borrow his money or let him pay their reckoning they are i am told a sort of disease of the place which a man of fortune is sure to catch as soon as he arrives there and these fast friends stick so close to him that he can never shake them off while he keeps his gown on his back  the university of london is not without its tufthunters who fasten like leeches on a young man of fortune at his first coming to town they beset him as soon as he arrives and when they have once surrounded him seldom fail of securing him to themselves for no persons of character care to have any connections with him when he has been frequently seen in such bad company it is a great misfortune for any young gentleman to fall into their hands though indeed as a fool is the natural prey of knaves the wealthy maintainers of this fraternity are generally none of the wisest and as at the university where the learned pate ducks to the golden fool the gentlemanstudent is distinguished by a cap with a gold tuft i always consider these sons of folly in town as adorned with a showy cap hung with bells which serve at once to denote the depth of their parts and to call their train about them  the dialect of the town has very expressively characterised these humble dependants on men of fortune by the name of hangerson they will indeed take such sure hold and hang on a man so constantly that it is almost impossible to drop them whenever the gentleman appears the hangeron is sure to be at his elbow they will squeeze themselves into every party that is formed and i have known instances of their thrusting themselves into strange families by sticking to their patrons skirts and impudently introducing themselves where he has been invited to dinner which indeed i think would not be an improper custom provided they would submit to stand behind his chair they will stick so closely that all the adhesive quality of burs pitch etc seem to be collected in them and the line in popes odyssey so often ridiculed may rather be considered as emphasis than tautology in speaking of them the hangeron clings to his fool as ulysses did to the rock and in popes words they stick adherent and suspended hang   the tenaciousness of a hangeron is so very strong that whoever is drawn into their snares is so firmly limed he can hardly ever loose himself from them for as nothing but the lowest meanness of spirit could ever prevail on a man to submit to such dependence on another it is in vain to think of getting rid of such abject wretches by treating them with contempt they will take as much beating provided you will allow them an equal degree of familiarity as a spaniel they will also submit to do any little offices and are glad to make themselves useful whenever they have an opportunity they will go among the brokers to borrow money for you pimp for you or submit to any other such gentlemanlike employment to serve their friend  it must here be noted that every hangeron is a person of strict honor and a gentleman for though his fortune is to be sure somewhat inferior to yours and he submits to make himself convenient on several occasions yet on that account you are indebted to his infinite goodnature and all his endeavors to serve you proceed from his great friendship and regard for you i remember one of these friendly gentlemen who carried his esteem so far that in a quarrel with his rich companion in which he was favored with several tweaks by the nose and kicks on the breech he received all these injuries with patience and only said with tears in his eyes dear jack i never expected this usage from you you know i dont mind fighting but i should never have a moments peace if i was to do you the least injury come jack let us buss and be friends their gentility is unquestionable for they are seldom of any trade though they are sometimes being youngerbrothers perhaps of a profession i know one who is a nominal lawyer but though his friend has often feed him our counselor could never with any propriety consider him as a client and i know another who like gibbet in the play is called captain whose elegant manner of living must be supported by his being on full pay with his patron since he does not receive even the common soldiers groat a day from his commission however considering at one view the gentility of their profession and the shortness of their finances i often look on them as a band of decayed gentlemen the honorable pensioners of those they follow the great men among the romans had a number of these hangerson which attended them wherever they went and were emphatically called umbrae or shadows and indeed this appellation conveys a very full idea of the nature of these humble retainers to the wealthy since they not only follow them like their shadows but like a shadow prove the substance true for whenever you observe one or more of these umbrae perpetually at the heels of any gentleman you may fairly conclude him to be a man of fortune  these faithful friends are so careful of every thing that concerns you that they always enquire with the greatest exactness into your affairs and know almost as well as your steward the income of your estate they are also so fond of your company and so desirous of preserving your good opinion that a hangeron will take as much pains to keep you entirely to himself and to prevent a rival in your affections as a mistress and as a convenient female is a very necessary part of the equipage of a person of fashion these male companions must be a very agreeable part of the retinue of those highspirited young gentlemen who are fond of being the head of their company it is only a more refined taste in expense to pay a man for laughing at your wit and indulging your humor and who will either drink his bottle with you at the tavern or run to the end of the town for you on an errand  i might also take notice of an humbler sort of hangerson who fix themselves to no one particular but fasten upon all their friends in their turns their views indeed are seldom extended beyond a present subsistence and their utmost aim perhaps is to get a dinner for this purpose they keep a register of the hours of dining of all their acquaintance and though they contrive to call in upon you just as you are sitting down to table they are always with much difficulty prevailed upon to take a chair if you dine abroad or are gone into the country they will eat with your family to prevent their being melancholy on account of your absence or if your family is out they will breakfast dine and sup with you out of charity because you should not be alone every house is haunted with these disturbers of our meals and perhaps the best way to get rid of them would be to put them with the rest of your servants upon boardwages  but besides these danglers after men of fortune and intruders on your table in town the country breeds a race of lowly retainers which may properly be ranked among the same species almost every family supports a poor kinsman who happening to be no way related to the estate was too proud of his blood to apply himself in his youth to any profession and rather chose to be supported in laziness at the familyseat they are indeed known perhaps to be cousins to the squire but do not appear in a more creditable light than his servants out of livery and sometimes actually submit to as mean offices of drudgery as the groom or whipperin the whole fraternity of hangerson whether in town or country or under whatever denomination are the sons of idleness for it will be found upon examination that whenever a man whose bread depends on his industry gives himself up to indolence he becomes capable of any meanness whatever and if they cannot dig yet like our hangerson to beg they are not ashamed  this day is published in two neat pocket volumes price six shillings bound  with a new translation of the mottos and quotations  the connoisseur by mr town

largiendo  ter to mr town sir i have been some years married to one of the best women in the world she possesses all the virtues that can be named but alas she possesses some of them to excess those which i wish to particularize and which are infinitely pernicious to me and my fortunes are her superabundant goodnature and her boundless generosity  it is a little difficult perhaps to ascertain what are or ought to be the exact bounds of goodnature which of all virtues seems to me most necessary to be confined or at least mitigated in such a manner as to hinder it from destroying its own excellence and utility on the one hand if it is restrained too close the world will say that it must entirely lose its essence but fatal experience has convinced me that if it is permitted to enjoy a full unlimited sway this amiable virtue becomes a ridiculous vice and brings with it as in my wifes case fruitless expenses illjudged concessions and a kind of blind folly that is always liable to contempt  generosity is the daughter of goodnature she is very fair and lovely when under the tuition of judgment and reason but when she escapes from her tutors and acts indiscriminately according as her fancy allures her she subjects herself like her mother to the blasts of sneer ridicule and disdain  to illustrate these assertions by some examples from among the many mishaps losses and embarassments which have accrued to us in the course of our domestic affairs give me leave to tell you that some years ago we had a footboy who acted as butler and had the custody of all the little plate which our small fortune could afford us the fellow was awkward and unfit for the station but my wife very goodnaturedly was determined to keep him in our service because he intended to marry the nurserymaid and would undoubtedly make an excellent husband the rascal was a thief but as it is illnatured to suspect people before we have full proof of their knavery several of his tricks and petty larcenies were attributed to the itinerant jews and higlers we then living at newington who frequently called at our door flushed with success and relying on my wifes credulity and goodnature he began to form deeper designs and as he lay in the kitchen pretended to have seen a man breaking in at the window and to have hid himself with a chopping knife in his hand so as to have felled the villain to the ground as soon as he had put his body through the casement a noise from without was said to have given an alarm to the housebreaker and to have interrupted him in his attempt but some whole panes of glass being dislocated from their lead and some hacks and scratches of a chisel marks all made by our own servant being visible next morning my wife very generously rewarded her jemmy whom she jocularly called scrub for his diligence and courage in defending us from having our throats cut this terrible tale was doubtless formed in order to remove all suspicions when he should pillage the house himself but precautions being taken by us in consequence of this alarm to fortify our bedchamber where he knew our current treasure was reposited jemmy thought it time to decamp so that in about a week after he had received the reward i hinted at of a crown piece from his lady he stole her gold repeating watch and a pair of our best silver candlesticks with which he voluntarily transported himself as we have been since told to the west indies leaving his mistress the nurserymaid big with child and thereby giving great license to the neighborhood to animadvert upon my wifes amazing prescience in foreseeing his excellencies as an husband  you must further be told sir that my dear consort in the full glow of her goodness is never contented unless her servants marry each other all i can urge against so impolitic a custom has been to no purpose marriage she says prevents vice and saves souls from destruction perhaps it may but are no unmarried servants to be found in mr fieldings register office or elsewhere but what are vicious at least i am sure that this piece of sanctity is very expensive in its effects and is attended with many inconveniences one of her maids about two years ago was discovered to be very intimate with my footman my wife to prevent ill consequences hastened to have them married and was present herself at the ceremony she admired the modesty of the woman and the decent gravity of the man during the holy rites and she was entirely convinced that no harm could have happened from so decent a couple in little more than three months after the marriage patty brought forth a swinging girl but as it was born almost six months before its time my wife advised them to keep it the remaining half year in cotton she did this purely from a motive of goodnature to try to shield the new married womans reputation but finding our neighbors fleer at the incident and smile contemptuously at the prescription of cotton she contented herself in believing pattys own account that in truth she had been married eight months before by a fleetparson but was afraid to own it  but if my wifes indulging her domestics in matrimony was productive of no other ill consequence than merely their being married it might indeed sometimes rather prove a benefit than a detriment but the chaster and more sober they have been before marriage the greater number of children are produced in matrimony and my wife looks upon herself as in duty obliged to take care of the poor helpless offspring that have been begotten under her own roof so that i assure you sir my house is so well filled with children that it would put you immediately in mind of the foundling hospital with this difference however that in my hospital not only the children are provided for whether bastards or legitimate but also the fathers and mothers  your high office mr censor requires and leads you to hear domestic occurrences otherwise i should scarce have troubled you with the records of a private family almost ruined by excrescencies of virtue the same overflowing humanity runs through the whole conduct of the dear woman whom i have mentioned even in trifles she is full of works of supererogation our doors are perpetually surrounded with beggars where the halt the maimed and the blind assemble in as great numbers as at the door of the roman catholic chapel in lincolns innfields she not only gives them money but sends them out great quantities of bread beer and cold victuals and she has her different pensioners as she herself calls them for every day in the week but the expense attending these outdoor petitioners many of whom have from time to time been discovered to be impostors is nothing in comparison to the sums that are almost daily drawn from her by begging letters it is impossible to imagine a calamity by which she has not been a sufferer in relieving those who have extorted money from her by pretended misfortunes the poor lady has been much hurt by losses in trade has been a great sufferer by fire undergone many hardships from sickness and other unforeseen accidents and it was but yesterday that she paid a long apothecarys bill brought on by a violent fever thus sir though my wife goes into but little company and the familyexpences are to all appearance very small yet my wifes superabundant goodnature is such perpetual drawback on her economy that we run out considerably this extravagant and illjudged generosity renders all her numerous excellencies of none effect and i have often known her almost destitute of clothes because she had distributed her whole wardrobe among liars sycophants and hypocrites  thus sir as briefly as i can i have set before you my unhappy case i am perishing by degrees not by any real extravagance any designed ruin or any indulgence of luxury and riot in the person who destroys me on the contrary no woman can exceed my wife in the simplicity of her dress the humility of her desires or the contented easiness of her nature what name sir shall i give to my misfortunes they proceed not from vice nor even from folly they proceed from too tender a heart a heart that hurries away or absorbs all judgment and reflection to call these errors the fruits of goodnature is too mild a definition and yet to give them an harsher appellation is unkind let me suffer what i will i must kiss the dear hand that ruins me  in my tender hours of speculation i would willingly impute my wifes faults to our climate and the natural disposition of our natives when the english are goodnatured they are generally so to excess and as i have not seen this particular character delineated in any of your papers i have endeavored to paint it myself and shall draw to the conclusion of my letter by one piece of advice not to be generous overmuch the highest acts of generosity are seldom repaid in any other coin but baseness and ingratitude and we ought ever to remember that out of ten lepers cleaned one only came back to return thanks the rest were made whole and went their way  i am sir your most humble servant timon of london   a letter directed for g k is left at the publishers  this day is published in two neat pocket volumes price six shillings bound  with a new translation of the mottos and quotations  the connoisseur by mr town critic and censorgeneral number xcix thursday december         da veniam servire tuis quod nolo calendis mart to mr town sir at this season of the year while the streets resound with the cry of new almanacks and every stall is covered with news from the stars diaries predictions complete ephemeris etc drawn up by partridge parker vincent wing and the rest of the sagacious body of philomaths and astrologers give me leave to acquaint you of my intentions of appearing annually in a like capacity you must know sir that having observed that among the great variety of almanacks now published there is not one contrived for the use of people of fashion i have resolved to remedy this defect by publishing one every year under the title of the court calendar calculated for the meridian of st jamess  the plan which has been hitherto followed by our almanackmakers can be of no use whatever to the polite world who are as widely separated in their manner of living from the common herd of people as the inhabitants of the antipodes to know the exact rising and setting of the sun may serve to direct the vulgar tradesman and mechanic when to open shop or go to work but persons of fashion whose hours are not marked by the course of that planet are indifferent about its motions and like those who live under the equinoctial line have their days and nights of an equal degree of length all the year round the redletter days pointed out in our common almanacks may perhaps be observed by some formal ladies who regulate their going to church by them but people of quality percieve no difference between the moveable or immovable feasts and fasts and know no use of sunday but as it serves to call them to the cardtable what advantage can a beau reap from riders list of the fairs which can only be of service to his groom or what use can any gentleman or lady make of those diaries now inscribed to them which are filled with algebra and the mathematics in a word the present uncouth way of dividing the months into saints days sundays and the like is no more adapted to the present modes of polite life than the roman division into ides nones and calends  instead of supposing with the vulgar tribe of astronomers that the day begins at sunrise my day which will commence at the time that it usually breaks in fashionable apartments will be determined by the rising of people of quality thus the morning dawns with early risers between eleven and twelve and noon commences at four when at this time of the year the dinner and waxlights come in together for want of a thorough knowledge of the distribution of the day all who have any connection with the polite world might be guilty of many mistakes and when an honest man from cornhill intended a nobleman a visit after dinner he would perhaps find him sipping his morning chocolate the inconveniences of the old style in our manner of reckoning the days were so manifest that it was thought proper to amend them by act of parliament i am resolved in like manner to introduce the new style of dividing the hours also into my almanac for can any thing be more absurd than to fix the name of morning noon and evening etc at present on the same hours which bore them in the reign of queen elizabeth a duchess is so far from dining at eleven that it often happens that her grace has not then opened her eyes on the teatable and a maid of honor would no more rise at five or six in the morning as it was called by the early dames of queen besss court than she would in imitation of those dames breakfast upon strong beer and beefsteaks indeed in those houses where the hours of quality are observed by only one part of the family the impolite irregularity of the other in adhering to the old style occasions great disturbance for as lady townly says such a house is worse than an inn with ten stage coaches what between the impertinent people of business in a morning and the intolerable thick shoes of footmen at noon one has not a wink of sleep all night  the reformation which i have also made in respect to the redletterdays is no less considerable i have not only wiped away that immense catalogue of saints which crowd the popish calendar but have also blotted out all the other saints that still retain their places in our common almamacks wellknowing that persons of fashion pay as little attention to the apostles and evangelists as to st mildred st bridget or st winifred indeed i retain the old name of st john because i am sure that people of quality will not think of any bodys being designed under that title except the late lord bolingbroke having thus discarded the saints people whom nobody knows i have taken care to introduce my readers into the best company for the redletters in my calendar will serve to distinguish those days on which the ladies of the first fashion keep their routes and visiting days a work of infinite use as well to the persons of distinction themselves as to all those who have any occasional intercourse with the polite world that season of the year commonly distinguished by the appellation of lent which implies a time of fasting i shall consider according to its real signification in the beau monde as a yearly festival and shall therefore mention it under the denomination of the carnival the propriety of this will be evident at first sight since nothing is so plain as that at this season all kinds of diversion and jollity are at the height in this metropolis instead of the man in the almanac i at first intended in imitation of mr dodsleys memorandum book to delineate the figure of a fine gentleman dressed a la mode but i was at length determined by the advice of some ingenious friends to suffer the old picture to remain there since as it appears to be run through the body in several places it may not improperly represent that fashionable character a duellist  in the place which is allotted in other almanacks for the change of weather as hail frost snow cloudy and the like i shall set down the change of dress adapted to different seasons and ranged under the titles of hats capuchins cardinals sacks negligees gause handkerchiefs ermine tippets muffs etc and in a parallel column according to the custom of other almanacks i shall point out the several parts of the body affected by these changes such as head neck breast shoulders face hands feet legs etc and as mr rider accompanies every month with seasonable cautions about sowing turnips raising cabbages bloodletting and such other important articles i shall give such directions as are most suitable to the beaumonde as a specimen of which i shall beg leave to lay before you the following observations on the month of may  if the season proves favorable it will be proper at the beginning of this month to attend to the cultivation of your public gardens trim your trees put your walks in order look after your lamps have ballads written and set to music for the ensuing summer ladies and gentlemen must be careful not to catch cold in crossing the water or by exposing themselves to the damp air in the dark walk at vauxhall  toward the middle of this month the air at both playhouses will begin to be too close and sultry for ladies that paint to risk the loss of their complexion in them  about the end of this month it will be expedient for those ladies who are apt to be hysterical when the town empties to prepare for their removal to tunbridge cheltenham and scarborough for the benefit of the waters  i am sir your humble servant tycho courtly   i did not think of ever mentioning the old woman who calls herself mary singleton again but having just received the following letter by the pennypost i cannot so far affront the young lady by whom it is written as not to publish it but though i shall always be glad to hear from one who writes with so much spirit yet i must beg that for the future she would choose some other subject since to use the expression of that wellbred lady her aunt it is not perfectly civil to entertain the town with her private affairs  sir as my aunt singleton has publicly given her honor that she will never read any of your future papers i think i may venture to send you a letter without fear of her discovery an incident which might perhaps be of cruel consequence to me as i know she can never forgive i am not under any apprehensions of being betrayed by her friends she has but few and those are a sort that rather choose to sooth her weaknesses than to raise her choler not knowing whether in her hours of peevishness some of her bile may not fall upon themselves  i own i was much surprised to find my name in print and to see my picture drawn at full length i observe that my guardian aunt like all painters whether male or female has dipped her pencil in the colors of flattery and accordingly she has drawn me if not entirely perfect at least only with such faults as are rather commendable than otherwise a silence in company and too much submission to judgments not so good as my own are failings natural to my youth and want of experience which time and an introduction into proper company very different from such as i see at my aunts teatable will soon cure but i am still conscious that neither the progress of time the gifts of fortune nor the success of improvement can render me what she has already painted me a faultless monster whom the world never saw   she affirms that i sing and play to great perfection upon my word sir i have no voice she teizes me sometimes to squall forth a solo and i obey because as she justly tells you i tremble at her look which if it had the family power of one of her ancient ancestors must long since have turned me into stone but what is the effect of my song alas it generally proves only an incantation to rouse the lapdog out of a sound sleep upon his cushion or to set the parrot and the mackaw into a chorus of screaming that would if possible awaken our neighbors the dead in st giless church yard  she hints that i am in love with a certain military gentleman of no fortune and she adds that he is modest brave studious and polite that an officer comes often to our house is strictly true that he has no fortune is no less so but that i am in love with him is absolutely false nor are his visits to me they are to my aunt whom he certainly would prefer to any dowager whatever without a jointure and who to my knowledge would be highly pleased notwithstanding her family pride to change the name of singleton into okelly  this leads me to let you into the real cause why she prefers the world to all other weekly essays whatever the partiality does not arise from the merit of the performance in general but from the subject of one particular paper no    which constantly lies upon her table hid under the workbasket and which strongly recommends by various precepts and examples the admiration and love of old women  i am watched too close to write to you a longer letter and am therefore obliged to conclude abruptly but am  your humble servant julia     the connoisseur by mr town critic and censorgeneral number c thursday december         ilicet parasiticae arti maximam in malam crucem abeo ab illis postquam video me sic ludificarier pergo ad alios venio ad alios deinde ad alios una res plaut to mr town sir i am one of those idle people of whom you have lately given an account who not being bred to any business or able to get a livelihood by work have taken up the more servile trade of an hangeron  i first served my time with an old nobleman in the country and as i was a distant relation of his lordships i was admitted to the honor of attending him in the double capacity of valet and apothecary my business in a morning was to wait on him at dressing time to hold the basin while he washed his hands buckle his shoes and tie on his neckcloth besides this his lordship had such a regard for me that nobody but myself was ever trusted with cutting his corns or paring his toenails and whenever he was sick it was always my office to hold his head during the operation of an emetic to attend him in the watercloset when he took a cathartic and sometimes to administer a clyster if his lordship had no company i was indeed permitted to sit at table with him but when he received any visiters more grand than ordinary i was equipped together with some of the bestlooking tenants in a tyewig fulltrimmed coat and lacedwaistcoat in order to swell the retinue of his servants out of livery i bore my slavery with the greatest degree of patience as my lord would often hint to me that i was provided for in his will however i had the mortification to find myself supplanted in his good graces by the chaplain who had always looked upon me as his rival and contrived at length to outwheedle outfawn and outcringe me in a word my lord died  and while the chaplain who constantly prayed by him during his last illness had the consolation of having a good benefice secured to him in the will my name was huddled among those of the common servants with no higher legacy than twenty guineas to buy mourning  with this small pittance besides what i had made a shift to squeeze out of the tenants and tradesmen as fees for my good word when i had his lordships ear i came up to town and embarked all i was worth in fitting myself out as a gentleman soon after as good luck would have it the nephew and heir of my old lord came from abroad when i contrived to wind me into his favor by abusing his deceased uncle and fattened myself upon him it is true he supported me admitted me into an equal share of his purse but considering the dangers to which i was constantly exposed on his account i regarded his bounties as only plasters to my sores my head back and ribs have received many a payment which should have been placed to his lordships account and i once narrowly escaped being hanged for murdering a poor fellow whom my lord in a frolic had run through the body my patron among other marks of his taste kept a mistress and i as his particular crony and a man of honor was allowed to visit her it happened one evening he unluckily surprised us in some unguarded familiarities together but my lord was so far from being enraged at it that he only turned madam out of the room and very coolly kicked me down stairs after her  i was now thrown upon the wide world again but as i never wanted assurance i soon made myself very familiarly acquainted with a young gentleman from ireland who was just come over to england to spend his estate here i must own i had some difficulty in keeping on good terms with this new friend as i had so many of his own countrymen to contend with who all claimed a right of acquaintance with him and some of them even pretended to be related to him besides they all persuaded the young squire that they had fortunes in different parts of ireland though not one of them had any real estate any more than myself though indeed i also had a nominal   00 l per ann in the west indies these furious fellows for sir they would all fight gave me much trouble however i found out my young friends foible and in spite of his countrymen became his inseparable companion he was not only very fond of women but had a particular passion for new faces and to humor this inclination i was perpetually on the lookout to discover fresh pieces for him i brought him mantuamakers milliners and servantmaids in abundance and at length grew so great a favorite by having prevailed on one of my own cousins to comply with his proposals that i verily believe he would soon have made me easy for life in an handsome annuity if he had not been unfortunately run through the body in a duel by one of his own countrymen  i next got into favor with an old colonel of the guards who happened to take a fancy to me one evening at the tilt yard coffeehouse for having carried off a pint bumper more than a lieutenant of a man of war that had challenged my toast as his sole delight was centered in the bottle all he required of me was to drink glass for glass with him which i readily complied with as he always paid my reckoning when sober he was the besthumoured man in the world but he was very apt to be quarrelsome and extremely mischievous when in liquor he has more than once flung a bottle at my head and emptied the contents of a bowl of punch in my face sometimes he has diverted himself by setting fire to my ruffles shaking the ashes of his pipe over my perriwig or making a thrust at me with the redhot poker and i remember he once soused me all over with the urine of the whole company by clapping a large pewter jordan topsyturvy upon my head all these indignities i very patiently put up with as he was sure to make me double amends for them the next morning and i was very near procuring a commission in the army through his interest when to my great disappointment he was suddenly carried off by an apoplexy  you will be surprised when i tell you that i next contrived to squeeze myself into the good opinion of a rich old curmudgeon a citymerchant and one of the circumcised he could have no objection to my religion as i used to spend every sunday with him at his country house where i preferred playing at cards to going to church nor could i indeed get any thing out of him beyond a dinner but i had higher points in view as he had nobody to inherit his fortune but an only daughter who was kept always in the country i became so desperately in love with her that i would even have turned jew to obtain her instead of that i very foolishly made a christian of her and we were privately married at the fleet when i came to break the matter to the father and to make an apology for having converted her he received me with a loud laugh sir says he if my child had married the devil he should have had every penny that was her due but  as she is only my bastard the law cannot oblige me to give her a farthing  this i found to be too true and very happily for me my christian wife had so little regard for her new religion that she again became an apostate and was taken into keeping to which i readily gave my consent by one of her own tribe and complexion i shall not tire you with a particular detail of what has happened to me since i shall only acquaint you that i have exactly followed the precept of becoming all things to all men i was once supported very splendidly by a young rake of quality for my wit in talking blasphemy and ridiculing the bible till my patron shot himself through the head and i lived at bed and board with an old methodist lady for near a twelvemonth on account of my zeal for the new doctrine till one of the maidservants wickedly laid a child to me at present mr town i am quite out of employ having just lost a very profitable place which i held under a great man in quality of his pimp my disgrace was owing to the baseness of an old covent garden acquaintance whom i palmed upon his honor for an innocent creature just come out of the country but the hussy was so ungrateful as to bestow on both of us convincing marks of her thorough knowledge of the town  i am sir your very humble servant peter supple   to mr town sir i have a little goddaughter in the country to whom i every year send some diverting and instructive book for a newyearsgift i would therefore beg you to recommend to me one fit for the purpose which will oblige  your humble servant t  w      to mr t  w  sir i know no book so fit for your purpose as the connoisseur lately published in two pocket volumes which i would further recommend to all fathers and mothers grandfathers and grandmothers uncles and aunts godfathers and godmothers to give to their sons and daughters grandsons and granddaughters nephews and nieces godsons and goddaughters  as being undoubtedly the best present at this season of the year that can possibly be thought of  town connoisseur     n b large allowance to those who buy quantities to give away  the connoisseur by mr town critic and censorgeneral number ci thursday january         janique bifrontis imago virg as the appointed time of our publication now happens to fall on newyearsday i cannot open the business of the year with a better grace than by taking the present hour for the subject of this paper a subject which pleases me the more as it also gives me an opportunity of paying my readers the compliments of the season and most sincerely wishing them all a happy new year and a great many of them but in order to make these civilities of more consequence than a bare compliment i will also endeavor to give them a little wholesome advice by which they may be most likely to ensure to themselves that happiness and to go through the ensuing year with ease and tranquillity  no god in the heathen pantheon was expressed by properer emblems or more significantly represented than janus whom we may fairly style in our language the god of the new year the medals on which the image of this deity was engraved bore two faces not ogling each other like those on the shillings of philip and mary nor cheek by jowl like the double visage on the coin of william and mary but turned from each other one looking forwards as it were into futurity and the other taking a retrospective view of what was past there cannot surely be devised a stronger or more sensible lesson of moral instruction than this figure teaches us this double view comprehends in itself the sum of human prudence for the most perfect reason can go no higher than wisely to guess at the future by reflecting on the past and morality is never so likely to persevere in a steady and uniform course as when it sets out with a fixed determination of mutually regulating the new year by a recollection of the old and at the same time making the succeeding a critique on the last  most of the faults in the general conduct of mankind and their frequent miscarriages in their most favorite enterprises will be found upon examination to result from an imperfect and partial view of what relates to their duty or undertakings some regulate their actions by blind guess and rashly presuming on the future without the least attention to the past with these the impetuosity of the passions gives their reason no scope to exert itself but neglecting the premises they jump to a conclusion others who are often taken for men of deep reflection and mavelous understanding meditate so profoundly on the past that they scarce take any notice either of the present or the future to these two characters whose misconduct arises from two such contrary sources may indeed be added a third whose wild irregular behavior is founded on no fixed principles but proceeds from a total absence of thought and reflection these easy creatures act entirely at random neither troubling themselves with what has been what is or what will be and as the image of janus seems to bear two heads these thoughtless vacant animals may almost be said to have no head at all  but that the necessity of taking this comprehensive view of our affairs may appear in the stronger light let us consider the many difficulties in which men of any of the above characters are involved from a total neglect or partial survey of matters that should influence their conduct the first sort of men who nourish great expectations from the future and suffer hope to lay their prudence to sleep are very common indeed almost every man like the dairymaid with her pail of milk pleases himself with calculating the advantages he shall reap from his undertakings there is scarce a servitor at either university who when he takes orders does not think it more than possible he may one day be a bishop or at least head of a college though perhaps at first he is glad to snap at a curacy every walking attendant on our hospitals flatters himself that a few years will settle him in high practice and a chariot and among those few gentlemen of the inns of court who really deserve the name of students there is hardly one who sits down to lord coke without imagining that he may himself some time or other be lord chancellor at this early period of life these vain hopes may perhaps serve as spurs to diligence and virtue but what shall we say to those people who in spite of experience and repeated disappointments still place their chief dependence on groundless expectations from their future fortune this town swarms with people who rely almost solely on contingencies and our goals are often filled with wretches who brought on their own poverty and misfortunes by promising themselves great profit from some darling scheme which has at last been attended with bankruptcy the present extravagance of many of our spendthrifts is built on some ideal riches of which they are soon to be in possession and which they are laying out as freely as the girl in the farce squanders the ten thousand pounds she was to get in the lottery i am myself acquainted with a young fellow who had great expectations from an old uncle he had ten thousand pounds of his own in ready money and as the old gentleman was a good deal turned of sixty the nephew very considerately computed that his uncle could hardly last above five years during which time he might go on very genteely at the rate of  000 l per ann however the old gentleman held together above seven years the two last of which our young spark had no consolation but the daily hopes of his uncles death the happy hour at length arrived the will was tore open with rapture when alas the fond youth discovered that he had never once reflected that though he had a ticket in the wheel it might possibly come up a blank and had the mortification to find himself disinherited  i shall not dwell so particularly on the ridiculous folly of those profound speculatists who fix their attention entirely on what is past without making their reflections of service either for the present or the future because it is not a very common or tempting species of absurdity but shall rather advise the reader to consider the time past as the school of experience from which he may draw the most useful lessons for his future conduct this kind of retrospect would teach us to provide with foresight against the calamities to which our inexperience has hitherto exposed us though at the same time it would not throw us so far back as to keep us lagging like the old style behind the rest of the world to say the truth those sage persons who are given to such deep reflection as to let today and tomorrow pass unregarded by meditating on yesterday are as ridiculous in their conduct as country beaux in their dress who adopt the town modes just after they are become unfashionable in london  but there is no task so difficult as to infuse ideas into a brain hitherto entirely unaccustomed to thinking for how can we warn a man to avoid the misfortunes which may hereafter befall him or to improve by the calamities he has already suffered whose actions are not the result of thought or guided by experience these persons are indeed of all others the most to be pitied they are prodigal and abandoned in their conduct and by vicious excesses ruin their constitution till at length poverty and death stare them in the face together or if unfortunately their crazy frame holds together after the utter destruction of their fortune they finish a thoughtless life by an act of desperation and a pistol puts an end to their miseries  since then good fortune cannot be expected to fall into our laps and it requires some thought to ensure to ourselves a likelihood of success in our undertakings let us look back with attention on the old year and gather instructions from it in what manner to conduct ourselves through the new let us also endeavor to draw from it a lesson of morality and i hope it will not be thought too solemn a conclusion of this paper if i advise my readers to carry this reflection even into religion this train of thought that teaches us at once to reflect on the past and look forward to the future will also naturally lead us to look up with awe and admiration toward that being who has existed from all eternity and shall exist world without end no idea can give us a more exalted idea of the power who first created us and whose providence is always over us let us then consider with attention this pagan image by which we may add force to our morality and prudence to our ordinary conduct nor let us blush to receive a lesson from heathens which may animate our zeal and reverence for the author of christianity  g k is desired to send to the publishers where a letter is left for him  the connoisseur by mr town critic and censorgeneral number cii thursday january        longumque pulchra stemma repetit a leda mart to mr town sir it has been my good fortune to be born of a family that is recorded in the heralds dictionary as one of the most ancient in the kingdom we are supposed to have come into england with william the conqueror upon my accession some years ago to my elder brothers estate and title of a baronet i received a visit from rouge dragon esquire pursuivant at arms to congratulate me upon my new rank of a vavasour and to know whether i should choose to bear the dexter base points of the lady isabels saltire in chief or only her sinister corners she being one of the seventeen coheiresses of my great great great great great grandfathers fourth wife dorothy the daughter and sole heiress of simon de la frogpool of croakham in suffolk this unexpected visit must have disconcerted me to an invincible degree if upon recollection i had not only remembered mr rouge dragon as a constant companion to my late brother but as a kind of tutor in initiating him into the science of heraldy and the civil and military achievements to which our nobility and gentry are entitled as soon therefore as i could recover myself from my first surprise in hearing an unknown english language i humbly thanked mr dragon for the pains he had taken in considering my coat of arms so minutely but hoped he would give himself no farther trouble upon my account because i was fully determined to bear the plain shield of my grandfather sir peter without taking the least notice of lady isabels saltire in chief or even of her sinister corners  be it to my shame or not i must confess that heraldry is a science which i have never much cultivated nor do i find it very prevalent among the fashionable studies of the age arms and armorial tokens may i suppose be regularly distinguished and properly emblazoned upon the family plate to which they belong but i have observed of late that these honorable ensigns are not confined entirely to their proper owners but are usurped by every body who thinks fit to take them insomuch that there is scarce an hackney coach in london which is not in possession of a ducal crest an earls coronet or a baronets bloody hand this has often given me great offense as it reflects a scandal on our nobility and gentry and i cannot but think it very indecent for a dukes coach to be seen waiting at a nightcellar while the coachman is tipping off a glass of gin or for a countesss landau to set down ladies at the door of a common bawdy house i remember i was one morning disturbed at my breakfast by a fashionable rap at my door when looking out of my window i saw the coach of the lady dowager  drawn up before it i was extremely surprised at so early and unexpected a visit from her ladyship and while i was preparing to receive her i overheard her ladyship at high words with her coachman in my entry when stepping to the staircase i found that they were squabbling together about sixpence and soon perceived that her ladyship was dwindled into one of my housemaids this badge of nobility assumed at random according to the fancy of the coachpainter i have found inconvenient on other occasions for i once traveled from london to derby in an hired chariot finely ornamented with a viscounts cipher and coronet by which noble circumstance i was compelled in every inn to pay as a lord though i was not at that time even a simple baronet or in the language of my friend mr dragon arrived to the dignity of a vavasour  i have indeed sometimes doubted whether nobility and high rank are of that real advantage which they are generally esteemed to be and i am almost inclined to think that they answer no other desirable end than as far as they indulge our vanity and ostentation a long roll of ennobled ancestors makes i confess a very alluring appearance to see coronet after coronet passing before our view in an uninterrupted succession is the most soothing prospect that perhaps can present itself to the eye of human pride the exaltation that we feel upon such a review takes rise in a visionary and secret piece of flattery that as glorious and as long or even a longer line of future coronets may spring from ourselves as have depended from our ancestors we read in virgil that anchises to inspire his son with the properest incitement to virtue shows him a long race of kings emperors and heroes whom aeneas is foredoomed to give rise to and the misery of macbeth is made by shakespeare to proceed less from the consciousness of guilt than from the disappointed pride that none of his own race shall succeed him in the throne  the pride of ancestry and the desire of continuing our lineage when they tend to an incitement of virtuous and noble actions are undoubtedly laudable and i should perhaps have indulged myself in the pleasing reflection had not a particular story in a french novel which i lately met with put a stop to all vain glories that can possibly be deduced from a long race of progenitors  a nobleman of an ancient house of very high rank and great fortune says the novellist died suddenly and without being permitted to stop at purgatory was sent down immediately into hell he had not been long there before he met with his coachman thomas who like his noble master was gnashing his teeth among the damned thomas surprised to behold his lordship amidst the sharpers thieves pickpockets and all the canaille of hell started and cried out in a tone of admiration is it possible that i see my late master among lucifers tribe of beggars rogues and pilferers how much am i astonished to find your lordship in this place your lordship whose generosity was so great whose affluent housekeeping drew such crowds of nobility gentry and friends to your table and within your gates and whose fine taste employed such numbers of poor in your gardens by building temples and obelisks and by forming lakes of water that seemed to vye with the largest oceans of the creation pray my lord if i may be so bold what crime has brought your lordship into this cursed assembly  ah thomas replied his lordship with his usual condescension i have been sent hither for having defrauded my royal master and cheating the widows and fatherless solely to enrich and purchase titles honors and estates for that ungrateful rascal my only son but prithee thomas tell me as thou did always seem to be an honest careful sober servant what brought thee hither alas my noble lord replied thomas i was sent hither for begetting that son  i am sir your most humble servant reginald fitzworm   i must agree with my correspondent that the study of heraldry is at present in very little repute among us and our nobility are more anxious about preserving the genealogy of their horses than of their own family whatever value their progenitors may have formerly set upon their blood it is now found to be of no value when put into the scale and weighed against solid plebeian gold nor would the most illustrious descendant from cadwallader or the irish kings scruple to debase his lineage by an alliance with the daughter of a cityplumb though all her ancestors were yeomen and none of her family ever bore arms titles of quality when the owners have no other merit to recommend them are of no more estimation than those which the courtesy of the vulgar have bestowed on the deformed and when i look over a long tree of descent i sometimes fancy i can discover the real characters of sharpers reprobates and plunderers of their country concealed under the titles of dukes earls and viscounts  it is well known that the very servants in the absence of their master assume the same titles and tom or harry the butler or groom of his grace is always my lord duke in the kitchen or stables for this reason i have thought proper to present my reader with the pedigree of a footman drawn up in the same sounding titles as are so pompously displayed on these occasions and i dare say it will appear no less illustrious than the pedigrees of many families which are neither celebrated for their actions nor distinguished by their virtues  the family of the skips or skipkennels is very ancient and noble the founder of it maitre jaques came into england with the duchess of mazarine he was son of a prince of the blood his mother one of the mesdames of france this family is therefore related to the most illustrious maitres d hotel and valets de chamber of that kindgom jaques had issue two sons viz robert and paul of whom paul the youngest was invested with the purple before he was eighteen and made a bishop and soon after became an archbishop robert the elder came to be a duke but died without issue paul the archbishop left behind him an only daughter barbara baseborn who was afterward maid of honor and intermarrying with a lord of the bedchamber had a very numerous issue by him viz rebecca born a week after their marriage and died young joseph first a squire afterward knighted high sheriff of a county and colonel of the militia peter raised from a cabinboy to a lord of the admiralty william a faggot in the first regiment of the guards and a brigadier thomas at first an earls eldest son and afterward lord mayor of the city of london the several branches of this family were no less distinguished for their illustrious progeny jaques the founder first quartered lace on his coat and robert added the shoulderknot some of them indeed met with great trouble archbishop paul lost his see for getting a cookmaid with child barbara the maid of honor was dismissed with a big belly brigadier william was killed by a chairman in a pitched battle at an alehouse the lord of the admiralty was transported for seven years and duke robert had the misfortune to be hanged at tyburn  the connoisseur by mr town critic and censorgeneral number ciii thursday january          nihil videtur mundius ter to mr town sir it is my fortune to be married to a lady who is an extraordinary good housewife and is cried up by all the good women of her acquaintance for being the neatest body in her house they ever knew this sir is my grievance this superabundant neatness is so very troublesome and disgusting to me that i protest i had rather lodge in a carriers inn or take up my abode with the horses in the stables  it must be confessed that a due regard to neatness and cleanliness is as necessary to be observed in our habitations as our persons but though i should not choose to have my hands begrimed like a chimneysweepers i would not as among the superstitious mahometans wash them six times a day and though i should be loath to roll in a pigstye yet i do not like to have my house rendered useless to me under the pretense of keeping it clean  for my own part i cannot see the difference between having an house that is always dirty and an house that is always to be cleaned i could very willingly compound to be washed out of my home with other masters of families every saturday night but my wife is so very notable that the same cleansing work must be repeated every day in the week all the morning long i am sure to be entertained with the domestic concert of scrubbing the floors scouring the irons and beating the carpets and i am constantly hunted from room to room while one is to be dusted another dryrubbed another washed and another run over with a dry mop thus indeed i may be said to live in continual dirtiness that my house may be clean for during these nice operations every apartment is stowed with soap brickdust sand scrubbingbrushes hairbrooms ragmops and dishclouts  you may suppose that the greatest care is taken to prevent the least speck of dirt from soiling the floors for this reason all that come to our house besides the ceremony of scraping at the door are obliged to rub their shoes for half an hour on a large ragged mat at the entrance and then they must straddle their way along several lesser mats ranged at due distances from each other in the passage and like boys at play come into the room with a hop a step and a jump the like caution is used by all the family i myself am scarce allowed to stir a step without slippers my wife creeps on tiptoe up and down stairs the maidservants are continually stumping below in clogs or pattens and the footman is obliged to sneak about the house barefooted as if he came with a sly design to steal something  after what has been said you will naturally conclude that my wife must be no less nice in other particulars indeed she cannot conceive that any thing which is done by so neat a woman can possibly give offense i have therefore been in pain for her several times when i have seen her before company dust the teacups with a foul apron or a washinggown and i have more than once blushed for her when through her extreme cleanliness she has not been contented without breathing into our drinkingglasses and afterward wiping them with her pocket handkerchief people mr town who are very intimate with families seldom see them especially the female part but in disguise and it will be readily allowed that a lady wears a very different aspect when she comes before company than when she first sets down to her toilette my wife appears decent enough in her apparel to those who visit us in the afternoon but in the morning she is quite another figure her usual dishabille then is an ordinary stuff jacket and petticoat a double clout thrown over her head and pinned under her chin a black greasy bonnet and a coarse dowlas apron so that you would rather take her for a chairwoman nor indeed does she scruple to stoop to the meanest drudgery of one for such is her love of cleanliness that i have often seen her on her knees whitening an hearth or spreading dabs of vinegar and fullers earth over the boards  it is observed by swift that a nice man is a man of nasty ideas in like manner we may affirm that your very neat people are the most slovenly on many occasions i have told you my wifes morning trim but besides this she has another custom which creates the greatest disgust in me you must know sir that among other charms she prides herself vastly in a fine set of teeth and somebody has told her that nothing is so good for them as to rub them every morning with scotch snuff and fasting spittle as an husband is no stranger this recipe is constantly administered in my presence before breakfast and after this delicate application her pretty mouth which is afterward wiped for me to kiss in order to preserve her gums from the scurvy must be rinced  would you believe it  with her own water  i shall dwell no longer on this subject as i fear it may prove surfeiting both to you and your readers i shall therefore conclude with telling you that this scrupulous delicacy of my wife in the neatness of her house was the means of our losing a very good fortune a rich old uncle on whom we had great dependence came up to town last summer on purpose to pay us a visit but though he had rode above sixty miles that day he was obliged to stand in the passage till his boots were pulled off for fear of soiling the turkey carpet after supper the old gentleman as was his constant practice desired to have his pipe but this you may be sure could by no means be allowed as the filthy stench of the tobacco would never be got out of the furniture again and it was with much ado that my wife would even suffer him to go down and smoke in the kitchen we had no room lodge him in except a garret with nothing but bare walls because the chints bedchamber was indeed too nice for a dirty country squire these slights very much chagrined my good uncle but he had not been with us above a day or two before my wife and he came to an open quarrel and the occasion of it was this it happened that he had brought a favorite pointer with him who at his first coming was immediately locked up in the coalhole but the dog having found means to escape had crept slily up stairs and besides other marks of his want of delicacy had very calmly stretched himself out upon a crimson damask settee my wife not only sentenced him to the discipline of the whip but insisted upon having the criminal hanged up afterward when the master interposing in his behalf it produced such high words between them that my uncle ordered his horse and swore he would never darken our doors again as long as he breathed he went home and about two months after died but as he could not forgive the ill treatment which both he and his dog had met with at our house he had altered his will which before he had made entirely in our favor  i am sir your humble servant peter mucklove   it may not be improper as my correspondent has but slightly touched upon this topic to add a word or two by way of postcript to his letter on the extraordinary solicitude of many notable housewives in the care and preservation of their furniture in middling genteel families it is not uncommon to have things more for show than use and i cannot but applaud the ingenious thought of a friend of mine who has contrived to furnish his house in the most elegant taste at a very small expense he is pleased it is true to eat off your common stone ware because it looks so clean but you see his beaufet crowded with a variety of curious enamelled china plates which are ranged in such manner as to conceal the streaks of white paint that cement the broken pieces together he likes to drink his porter out of the original alehouse pewter pot but a large silver tankard always stands upon the sideboard which the most curious eye cannot at that distance discover to be french plate the whole range of rooms in his middle story is most grandly fitted up but as it would be pity to soil such good furniture his curtains which we must suppose to be made of the richest damask are carefully pinned up in paperbags and the chairs of which the seats and backs are undoubtedly of the same stuff are no less cautiously skreened with ordinarychecked linen thus does he answer by the appearance of finery all the purposes of pride and ostentation  like many families who being really possessed of ornamental and useful furniture make no more use of it than the beau blockhead does of his library which though it contains many books finely bound and gilt is designed merely for show and it would spoil the backs or rumple the leaves to look into the contents of them  the connoisseur by mr town critic and censorgeneral number civ thursday january         actum est ilicet peristi ter the use of language is the ready communication of our thoughts to one another as we cannot produce the objects which raise ideas in our minds we use words which are made signs of those objects themselves no man could convey to another the idea of a table or chair without pointing to those pieces of furniture as children are taught to remember the names of things by looking at their pictures thus if i wanted to mention king charles on horseback i must carry my companion to charing cross and would i next tell him of the statue of sir john barnard we must trudge back again and he must wait for my meaning till we got to the royal exchange we should be like the sages of laputa who as gulliver tells us having substituted things for words used to carry about them such things as were necessary to express the particular business they were to discourse on i have often beheld says he two of those sages almost sinking under the weight of their packs like pedlars among us who when they met in the streets would lay down their loads open their sacks and hold conversation for an hour together then put up their implements help each other to resume their burdens and take their leave in these circumstances a man of the fewest words could not indeed talk without carrying about him a much larger apparatus of conversation than is contained in the bag of the noted yeates or any other slightofhand artist he could not speak of a chicken or an owl but it must be ready in his pocket to be produced in such a case we could not say we heard but we saw the conversation of a friend as in the epistolary correspondence carried on by those pretty hieroglyphic letters as they are called where the picture of a deer and a woman finely dressed is made to stand for the expression of dear lady  but the invention of words has removed these difficulties and we may talk not only of any thing we have seen but what neither we nor the persons to whom we speak ever saw thus we can convey to another the idea of a battle without being reduced to the disagreeable necessity of learning it from the cannons mouth and we can talk of the people in the world of the moon without being obliged to make use of bishop wilkinss artificial wings to fly thither words therefore in the ordinary course of life are like the papermoney among merchants invented as a more ready conveyance by which the largest sum can be transmitted to the most distant places with as much ease as a letter while the same in specie would require bags and chests and even carts or ships to transport it but however great these advantages are the use of language has brought along with it several inconveniences as well as papermoney for as this latter is more liable to miscarry more easily concealed carried off or counterfeited than bullion merchants have frequent cause to complain that the convenience of this sort of cash is not without some alloy of evil and we find that in the use of language there is so much room for deceit and mistake that though it does not render it useless it is much to be wished some remedy could be contrived  men are so apt to use the same words in different senses and to call the same thing by different names that they cannot oftentimes understand or be understood if one calls that thing black which another calls green or that prodigality which another calls generosity they mistake each others meaning and can never come to agree till they explain the words it is to this we owe so much wrangling in discourse and so many volumes of controversy on almost every part of literature i have known a dispute carried on with great warmth and when the disputants have come to explain what each meant it has been discovered they were both of a side like the men in the play who met and fought first and after each had been heartily beat found themselves to be friends what should we say if this practice of calling things by their wrong names was to obtain among tradesmen if you was to send to your haberdasher for an hat you might receive a pair of stockings or instead of a cordial julep from your apothecary be furnished with a cathartic or a clyster  it would be needless to insist on the inconveniences arising from the misuse or misapprehension of terms in all verbal combats whether they be fought on the spot by word of mouth or like a game of chess maintained even though lands and seas interpose by the assistance of the press in our ordinary conversation it is notorious that no less confusion has arisen from the wrong application or perversion of the original and most natural import of words thus for instance the word devil is used at present only as a bugbear for children nor will it raise in the most vulgar minds the idea even of a cloven foot or the smell of brimstone and all we can understand by it are the errandboy of a printing house the name of a tavern and the broiled gizzard of a turkey the no less tremendous words damned and hellish are usurped equally to signify any thing superlatively good as well as bad and i am almost ashamed to mention that we cannot wonder a particular liquor should be distinguished by the name of bishop when the title of the highest dignitary of our church has been prostituted to a more scandalous purpose a mere country put might be startled at this juncture especially at the warlike sound of a route a drum or a drummajor which we know have been long adopted by the fashionable world without any design to alarm us with the notion of a campaign or a battle but only to call us without a pun to more peaceful engagements and he would be very much surprised to receive a card from a lady of quality inviting him to an hurricane or perhaps an earthquake  i remember when i commenced author i published a little pamphlet which i flattered myself had some merit though i must confess it did not sell conscious of my growing fame i resolved to send the first fruits of it to an aunt in the country that my relations might judge of the great honor i was likely to prove to the family but how was i mortified when the good lady sent me word that she was sorry to find i had ruined myself and had wrote a book for the parson of the parish had assured her that authors were never worth a farthing and always died in a goal notwithstanding this remonstrance i have still persisted in my ruin which at present i cannot say is quite completed as i can make three meals a day have yet a coat to my back with a clean shirt for sundays at least and am lodged somewhat below a garret however this prediction of my aunt has often led me to consider in how many senses different from its general acceptance the word ruined is frequently made use of when we hear this applied to another we should naturally imagine the person is reduced to a state worse than he was in before and so low that it is scarce possible for him to rise again but we shall often find instead of his being undone that he has rather met with some extraordinary good fortune and that those who pronounce him ruined either mean you should understand it in some other light or else call him undone because he differs from them in his way of life or because they wish him to be in that situation i need not point out the extreme cruelty as well as injustice in the misapplication of this term as it may literally ruin a man by destroying his character according to the old english proverb give a dog an ill name and hang him  most people are indeed so entirely taken up with their own narrow views that like the jaundiced eye every thing appears to them of the same color and it is no wonder that they should see ruin staring every man in the face who happens not to think as they do from this selfish prejudice we are led to make a wrong judgment of the motives and actions of others i shall therefore here set down a catalogue of some of my own acquaintance whom the charity and goodnature of the world have not scrupled to pronounce absolutely ruined  a young clergyman of cambridge might have had a good college living in about thirty years time or have been head of the house but he chose to quit his fellowship for a small cure in town with a view of recommending himself by his preaching  ruined  a fellow of another college refused to quit his books and his retirement to live as chaplain with a smoking drinking swearing foxhunting country squire who would have provided for him  ruined  dr classic a young physician from oxford might have had more practice than radcliffe or mead but having studied aristotles poetics and read the greek tragedies as well as galen and hippocrates he was tempted to write a play which was universally applauded  ruined  a student of the temple might have made sure of a judges robes or the chancellors seals but being tired of sauntering in westminster hall without even getting half a guinea for a motion he has accepted of a commission in one of the newraised regiments and is  ruined  a younger brother of a good family threw himself away upon an obscure widow with a jointure of  00 l per annum by which he is  ruined  another a man of fortune fell in love with and married a genteel girl without a farthing and though she makes him an excellent wife he is universally allowed to have  ruined himself  before i conclude i cannot but take notice of the strange sense in which a friend of mine once heard this word used by a girl of the town the young creature being all life and spirits engrossed all the conversation to herself and herself indeed was the subject of all the conversation but what most surprised him was the manner in which she used this word ruined which occurred frequently in her discourse though never intended by her to convey the meaning generally affixed to it it served her sometimes as an era to determine the date of every occurrence  she bought such a gown just after she was ruined  the first time she saw garrick in ranger she was in doubt whether it was before or after she was ruined  having occasion to mention a young gentleman she burst into raptures  o he is a dear creature  he it was that ruined me  o he is a dear soul  he carried me to an inn ten miles from my fathers house in the country where he ruined me  if he had not ruined me i should have been as miserable and as moping as my sisters but the dear soul was forced to go to sea and i was obliged to come upon the town three weeks after i was ruined  no not so much as three weeks after i was ruined  yes it was full three weeks after i was ruined  the connoisseur by mr town critic and censorgeneral number cv thursday january         gaudet equis canibusque et aprici gramine campi hor my cousin village from whom i had not heard for some time has lately sent me an account of a country parson which i dare say will prove entertaining to my town readers who can have no other idea of our clergy than what they have collected from the spruce and genteel figures which they have been used to contemplate here in doctors scarfs puddingsleeves starched bands and feathertoppd grizzles it will be found from my cousins description that these reverent ensigns of orthodoxy are not so necessary to be displayed among rustics and that when they are out of the pulpit or surplice the good pastors may without censure put on the manners as well as dress of a groom or whipperin  mr village to mr town doncaster jan   th      dear cousin i am just arrived here after having paid a visit to our old acquaintance jack quickset who is now become the reverend mr quickset rector of  parish in the north riding of this county a living worth upwards of three hundred pounds per annum as the ceremonies of ordination have occasioned no alteration in jacks morals or behavior the figure he makes in the church is somewhat remarkable but as there are many other incumbents of country livings whose clerical characters will be found to tally with his perhaps a slight sketch or as i may say rough draught of him with some account of my visit will not be unentertaining to your readers  jack hearing that i was in this part of the world sent me a very hearty letter informing me that he had been doublejapanned as he called it about a year ago and was the present incummbent of  where if i would favor him with my company he would give me a cup of the best yorkshire stingo and would engage to show me a noble days sport as he was in a fine open country with plenty of foxes i rejoiced to hear he was so comfortably settled and set out immediately for his living when i arrived within the gate my ears were alarmed with such a loud chorus of no mortals on earth are so happy as we that i began to think i had made a mistake till observing its close neighborhood to the church convinced me that this could be no other than the parsonagehouse on my entrance my friend whom i found in the midst of a roomfull of foxhunters in boots and bob wigs got up to welcome me to  and embracing me gave me the full flavor of his stingo by belching in my face as he did me the honor of saluting me he then introduced me to his friends and placing me at the right hand of his own elbow chair assured them that i was a very honest cock and loved a chase of five and twenty miles an end as well as any of them to preserve the credit of which character i immediately complied with an injunction though i must confess with less real rapture than a staunch foxhunter to toss off a pint bumper of port with the foot of the fox dipped and squeezed into it to give a zest to the liquor  but the whole economy of jacks life is very different from that of his brethren instead of having a wife and a housefull of children the most common family of a country clergyman he is single unless we credit some idle whispers in the parish that he is married to his housekeeper the calm amusement of piquet chess and backgammon have no charms for jack who sees his dearest action in the field and boasts that he has a brace of as good hunters in his stable as ever leg was laid over hunting and shooting are the only business of his life foxhounds and pointers lay about in every parlour and he is himself like pistol always in boots the estimation in which he holds his friends is rated according to their excellence as sportsmen and to be able to make a good shot or hunt a pack of hounds well are admirable qualities his parishioners often earn a shilling and a cup of ale at his house by coming to acquaint him that they have found a hare sitting or a fox in cover one day while i was alone with my friend the servant came in to tell him that the clerk wanted to speak with him he was ordered in but i could not help smiling when instead of giving notice of a burying christening or some other church business as i expected i found the honest clerk only come to acquaint his reverend superior that there was a covey of partridges of a dozen brace at least not above three fields from the house  jacks elder brother sir thomas quickset who presented him with the benefice he now enjoys is lord of the manor so that jack has full power to beat up the game unmolested he goes out three times a week with his brothers hounds whether sir thomas hunts or not and has besides a deputation from him as lord of the manor consigning the game to his care and empowering him to take away all guns nets and dogs from persons not duly qualified jack is more proud of this office than many other country clergymen are of being in the commission for the peace poaching is in his eye the most heinous crime in the two tables nor does the cure of souls appear to him half so important a duty as the preservation of the game  sunday you may suppose is as dull and tedious to this ordained sportsman as to any fine lady in town not that he makes the duties of his function any fatigue to him but as this day is necessarily a day of rest from the usual toils of the chase it happened that the first sunday after i was with him he had engaged to take care of a church in the absence of a neighboring clergyman which was about twenty miles off i engaged to accompany him and the more to encourage me he had assured me that we should ride over as fine a champaign open country as any in the north accordingly i was rouzed by him in the morning before daybreak by a loud hollowing of hark to merriman and the repeated smacks of his halfhunter and after we had fortified our stomachs with several slices of hung beef and a horn or two of stingo we sallied forth jack was mounted upon a hunter which he assured me was never yet thrown out and as we rode along he could not help lamenting that so fine a soft morning should be thrown away upon a sunday at the same time remarking that the dogs might run breast high  though we made the best of our way over hedge and ditch and took every thing we were often delayed by trying if we could prick a hare or by leaving the road to examine a piece of cover and he frequently made me stop not to look at the prospect but while he pointed out the particular course that reynard took or the spot where he had eathed at length we arrived on full gallop at the church where we found the congregation waiting for us but as jack had nothing to do but to alight pull his band out of the sermoncase give his brown scratch bob a shake and clap on the surplice he was presently equipped for the service in short he behaved himself both in the desk and pulpit to the entire satisfaction of all the parish as well as the squire of it who after thanking jack for his excellent discourse very cordially took us home to dinner with him  i shall not trouble you with an account of our entertainment at the squires who being himself as keen a sportsman as ever followed a pack of dogs was hugely delighted with jacks conversation church and king and another particular toast were in compliment i suppose to my friends clerical character the first drank after dinner but these were directly followed by a pint bumper to horses sound dogs hearty earth stopped and foxes plenty when we had run over again with great joy and vociferation as many chaces as the time would permit the bell called us to evening prayers after which though the squire would fain have had us stay and take an hunt with him we mounted our horses at the churchdoor and rode home in the dark because jack had engaged to meet several of his brothersportsmen who were to lie all night at his own house to be in readiness to make up for the loss of sunday by going out a cockshooting very early the next morning  i must leave it to you cousin to make what reflections you please on this character only observing that the country can furnish many instances of these ordained sportsmen whose thoughts are more taken up with the stable or the dogkennel than the church and indeed it will be found that our friend jack and all of his stamp are regarded by their parishioners not as parsons of the parish but rather as squires in orders  i am dear cousin yours etc   the connoisseur by mr town critic and censorgeneral number cvi thursday february         non haec solennia nobis vana superstitio veterumve ignara deorum imposuit saevis hospes trojane periclis servati facimus  virg it is with the utmost pleasure that i have observed an article in the newspapers signifying that the magistrates of this city will oblige all taverns alehouses etc to be shut up tomorrow which is appointed to be set apart as a day of solemn fast and humiliation on account of those dreadful earthquakes from which we have been so providentially preserved without such a restriction it is to be feared that too many of the vulgar will observe this day in the same manner as they are wont to observe the ordinary sundays which they have been long accustomed to look upon as dedicated to idleness and intemperance to which deities they very devoutly pour their libations according to their own phrase in a church with a chimney in it  but if the common herd are to be thus compelled to their duty persons of fashion who are above the law will i doubt pay as little regard to this nominal fast day as to ash wednesday good friday or the longexploded  0th of january nor can we expect that it will work any greater reformation of manners in them than the absurd panic occasioned formerly by the ridiculous predictions of a swiss madman therefore as they are not to be frightened into a sense of virtue and religion we should rather try to wean them gradually from their darling vices which may be kept under by softening methods though we cannot hope wholly to eradicate them for this purpose the first step to be previously taken as it appears to me should be to decoy people of quality into coming to church by making it as fashionable to be seen there as it was some time ago to meet at ranelagh on a sunday they must therefore be allowed to curtesy bow nod smile ogle whisper or even bawl to one another before the service is begun and that churches may resemble other public places of diversion ladies and gentlemen may be permitted to send their servants to keep places in the pews but it shall on no consideration be lawful for them as is their custom at the opera or playhouse to disturb the congregation by dropping in while the prayers are reading or to interrupt the parson by talking loud in the middle of the sermon  this point being once gained it might be possible to bring about some other reformations in the polite amusements perhaps to banish all such moral plays as the chances for ever from our theaters would be in effect to shut them up or condemn them to empty boxes the polite world may therefore be sometimes indulged with them at the particular desire of several persons of quality or for the benefit of some hospital when their appearance may be attributed to a motive of charity nor would i be so scrupulous as to abolish masquerades entirely though i would have them put under new regulations and no lady should be suffered to go there halfnaked under the pretense of being better disguised nor should any one be allowed to personate eve though with a figleaf as to the darling amusement of gaming i fear it would be a vain attempt to think of restraining it within any bounds at present nor is it possible to expel the cardtable from the routes of persons of fashion even upon a sunday i would therefore propose that since they must play the winnings on that day should be given to the poor of the parish and that they should use a particular sort of cards like those contrived for the amusement and instruction of children strewed with texts of scripture and other religious and moral sentences  gallantry and intrigue may be likewise reckoned among the fashionable amusements of the present age and i confess i am at a loss to know under what restrictions to confine them married people may perhaps be allowed to indulge themselves in any freedoms by the mutual consent of each party provided always that they are persons of distinction and that the match between them was made merely on account of family or fortune in conformity to the true sense and spirit of the late marriage act with respect to those who take a pleasure in debauching raw country girls and common tradesmens daughters i had once a thought that a clause should be added to the abovementioned act to oblige the offenders to do penance in a white sheet but i have since considered that our modern bucks and bloods would probably take as much pride in this badge of honor as a young officer in his scarf and cockade as to the genteel practice of keeping mistresses no one should be allowed to take a girl into keeping but those who are already past their grand climacteric and may be supposed to want a nurse except it should be thought expedient to extend this privilege to those spirited young fellows who at the age of five and twenty have worn down their constitutions to threescore  we cannot but admire the extreme courage and sense of honor which characterises our modern heroes and inspires them sometimes with a desire of killing their friends and sometimes of killing themselves but as this noble spirit should be only exerted against the common enemy the honor of the duellist might be satisfied i should think by a mockcombat without bloodshed and the courage of the suicide might be confined to a bare attempt on his own life without the loss of it duels therefore should be fought with guarded soils as in tragedyrencounters and any gentleman or even mechanic who finds an inclination to make away with himself may be allowed to try the experiment by drawing a knife or razor across his throat so as not to cut the windpipe or by running a sword through the skin without piercing the ribs or he may flash a pistol in his face charged with powder only or be tucked up in his own garters with a wad of cotton about his neck and his nearest relation standing by ready to cut him down if he pleases before he be quite dead  i am prevented from persuing this subject any farther in order to make room for the following letter  mr town as the day appointed for a general fast in these kingdoms is now at hand i shall beg leave to touch upon some laxities in the usual manner of observing a fast which though they are not of sufficient dignity to be taken notice of from the pulpit should yet be pointed out as the violation of the fast in these particulars is almost universal  the very name of a fast implies a day of abstinence of mortification and selfdenial which has always been injoined as a necessary means of subduing irregular desires and fitting us for holy meditations for this reason in former days when people of quality rose earlier than even mechanics now open their shops when the court itself dined at eleven that meal was deferred till four oclock in compliance with this religious exercise which was in those times a real abstinence a true piece of mortification and selfdenial but if the observance of a fast consists in not dining till four oclock our persons of fashion may be said to fast every day of their lives in truth the several hours of the day are adapted to such very different employments to what they were formerly that our four oclock stands in the place of their eleven and nothing can be more absurd to use no harsher term than to adhere to the form in the performance of a religious act when by the alteration of circumstances that form flatly contradicts the very meaning of its original institution i would also ask those rigid devotees who observe this day in all the strictness of the letter and would be shocked at sight of a leg of mutton or beefsteak on their tables whether the dining upon salt or other fish may not be considered rather as feasting than fasting if as is often the case it should happen to be a dish they are remarkably fond of all these methods of keeping a fast without abstinence mortification or selfdenial are mere quibbles to evade the performance of our duty and entirely frustrate the design of appointing this solemnity there is something of this nature very commonly practiced in france where there are many families who keep the whole lent with great strictness but the last night of it invite a great deal of company to supper the moment the clock strikes twelve a magnificent entertainment consisting of all sorts of rich fare is served up and these most christian debauchees sit down to indulge in luxury without sinning against the canon  i am sir your humble servant etc   the connoisseur by mr town critic and censorgeneral number cvii thursday february         cedunt grammatici vincuntur rhetores  juv to mr town  college cambridge jan  0 th      sir i have just now with near an hundred more taken the first degree which this university confers on her sons and begin to consider within myself in what manner we have spent our time for these four years past and what profit we are likely to receive hereafter from these our academical studies but upon retrospection i find that instead of having laid up a store of learning which might have been of service to us in our future connections and intercourse with mankind we have been confounding our heads with a miscellaneous heap of nonsense which most of us i am certain are endeavoring to unlearn as fast as possible we can instead of having acquired such a share of common sense as might have been of service to ourselves and acquaintance we must entirely sell off our old stock and begin the world of literature anew this reflection cannot be very pleasing to those who i must say have squandered away so very precious a time of life a time of life when though judgment perhaps is not come to maturity yet imagination and invention those noble offsprings of a promising mind are in the very flower and bloom of perfection  this seat of learning for it undoubtedly deserves that name has drawn and kept us together for some years our manners conversation and studies bear a great similitude but now either chance or choice is going to disperse us over the whole kingdom and our places of abode will scarcely be more widely different than our schemes of life notwithstanding this the same plan of study has been imposed on all whether agreeable or contrary to the bent of inclination has never been regarded mathematics is the standard to which all merit is referred and all the excellencies without these are quite overlooked and neglected the solid learning of greece and rome is a trifling acquisition and much more so every polite accomplishment in short if you will not get all euclid and his diagrams by heart and pore over saunderson till you are as blind as he was himself they will say of you as in the motto to one of your late papers actum est ilicet peristi not that i would depreciate this kind of learning it is certainly a most noble science and reflects the greatest honor on human wit and invention all that i complain of is the unreasonable stress that is laid upon it nay even the more abstruse parts of it which is still more absurd as there are so very few heads able to perceive and retain the nice chain of reasoning and deduction which must necessarily be made use of and as a small number of mathematical geniusses would be sufficient for the service of his majestys dominions  i take it for granted that your sagacity has by this time discovered that you have been addressed by a young man whose toooverweening conceit of himself has perhaps induced him to imagine that the university has not sufficiently rewarded his deserts if so you are not deceived but though this disappointment may at present set a little uneasy upon me yet i think i can foresee that it will be the most fortunate mortification that could possibly have befallen me for in the first place it has sufficiently abated that upstart pride which most young men are apt to take in their own abilities than which nothing can be more insufferable to all their acquaintance or a greater impediment to their own real improvement a pert scholar whenever he enters a room of company immediately assumes a superiority in discourse and thinks himself obliged to correct all improprieties in thought or expression you must speak by the card as hamlet says or expect the censure of this superficial coxcomb if according to the common form of speech you say that there is either heat in fire or coldness in ice he will inform you that you deliver yourself very inaccurately as mr lock has fully demonstrated he will tell you you cannot prove that two and two make four or that you are alive yourself these and a thousand other equally impertinent observations he is continually making to the no small uneasiness and perplexity of the ladies and honest country gentlemen  what is still a greater misfortune is that a man of this cast is never likely to know any better for having raked together a few metaphysical distinctions and scholastic refinements he thinks he has laid up a sufficient fund of knowledge for his whole life he despises all common sense which is the best sense through an ambition of appearing particular and as for the advice or opinion of others those he thinks himself indispensably bound to disregard inasmuch as such submission implies some inferiority which he would by no means be thought to labor under such a disposition as this i take to be the sure and infallible token of confirmed ignorance a melancholy instance of the depravity of human nature that the less we know the more we presume and the fewer advances we have made toward true knowledge the less occasion we think we have of any further improvement  in the second place if i may be allowed to judge of what i cannot possibly have experienced i take it to be the greatest benefit to a young person to meet with early disappointments in life for sooner or later every one must have his share of them and the sooner we meet with some of them the better for by this means the mind is easily made familiar with crosses and vexations and is not thrown off its balance by every thwarting and wayward accident by this means we submit to ills and troubles as the necessary attendants on mankind just as on a rainy day we make ourselves quiet and contented but hope for sunshine on the morrow and indeed there seems to be a strong analogy between the inclemency of the weather attacking our bodies and the storms of afflictions which batter our minds the rain will beat and the wind will roar let us use our utmost endeavors to the contrary but by enuring our persons to the vicissitudes of the seasons and using other proper methods we shall feel no very sensible inconvenience from them in like manner all our skill and art cannot prevent or elude the rubs and disasters to which we are liable but if by degrees and early in life we are hardened and accustomed to them and if by the help of reason and sound philosophy we arm and fortify ourselves against them they may still perhaps reach us but their shocks will be quite weak and languid and we may say of fortune as virgil says of priam when he hurled a javelin at pyrrhus  telum imbelle sine ictu conjecit  thus you see mr town that out of a seeming evil i have discovered a real good and i am certain if this method of reasoning could be made universal we should find much fewer murmurers against the present distribution and order of things  i am sir yours etc b a   mr town i am so great an admirer of the fair sex that i never let a tittle of their vendible writings escape me i bought this year the ladys diary merely because it was advertised as the womans almanac which i construed the almanac composed by a woman but i find i have been mistaken in my supposition it is not the work of a female the christian name of the author i have reason to believe is marmaduke unless i misunderstand a most curious copy of verses describing a most superb entertainment of fish flesh pies and tarts exhibited upon new years day      his surname remains as great an aenigma as any in his book his coadjutors contributers or assistants are messieurs walter trott timothy nabb patrick ocavannah john honey henry season and others i honor these gentlemen and their works but i own my chief delight is in reading over the riddles and unriddles the questions and the answers of miss sally west caelia miss nancy evelyn miss e s miss atkinson enira and other choice little feminine spirits of the age riddles are so becoming and appear so pretty when dandled about by ladies that they may be compared to soft smooth painted waxen babbies dressed up in a proper manner for misses to play with from eighteen to fourscore but above all i must take this opportunity of congratulating dear miss fanny harris who i find  has given an elegant solution to a prize problem by a fluxionary calculus founded on the properties of tangents and by that means has run away with no less than twelve diaries for this important year      as this young lady is justly called the honor of her sex and deals entirely in the properties of tangents i fear she will never descend so low as riddleme riddlemeree and therefore i must humbly offer by the vehicle of your paper mr town a small riddle invented with much pains and thought by myself to the solution of those three ingenious spinsters miss polly walker miss grace tetlow and miss ann rickaby to appear in the ladys diary of      and to receive upon appearance as a premium one complete set of the connoisseurs in pocket volumes to be the property of one or more of these three ladies who shall explain my aenigma fire and water mixed together add to this some salt and tin tell me ladies tell me whether in this mixture there is sin   the solution itself if not truly explained by the three graces to whom i now address it shall appear by your permission in the first thursdays connoisseur after next new years day  i am sir your humble servant michael

length to make up a whole paper must be contented to wait till i can find convenient room to introduce them i shall for the present fling together the two following from a number now lying before me though their subjects have no connection with each other  mr town you must know sir in my younger days i was very susceptible of the passion of love my heart was always fluttering jumping and skipping when a female object was in view and being a pretty good master of that kind of romantic nonsense with which the fair are too often captivated being fond of dancing frisking capering and fidgeting to all public places i gained the affections of many but could settle to none and my heart constantly returned to its owner with the wound healed  in this manner i lived till i grew past forty and thinking such kind of life not so agreeable but rather fatiguing i came to a resolution to marry and settle quietly in the world the remainder of my days you may guess from my general acquaintance i could not be a great while before i had an opportunity offered of meeting something suitable to my inclinations accordingly i fixed my mind on a widow lady about ten years younger than myself to whom i made known my intentions as soon as i could i was received in such a manner as all happy lovers would wish to be and at last got her promise for the completion but when i pressed the day was told it could not be so soon as i desired for to surrender on so short a courtship the world might impute as an indecorum in her character  i must tell you i soon found like malvolio in the play that she had a great passion for white silk stockings and you may be sure i always dressed my legs in that color but as ill luck would have it some little time since having stayed with her pretty late and not being able to get either coach or chair i was forced to trudge home in the rain my cursed white stockings were wet from top to bottom the next morning the rheumatism took possession of one of my knees which not only caused an hobble in my gait but obliged me to cloth my legs with thick ribbd worsted for the sake of warmth  thus hobbling and clothed i went to visit my charmer who as i entered the room was sitting in her chair more grave than usual which i imputed to her attention to domestic affairs and sat down by her i took hold of her hand and was going to intrude on her lips for a kiss  but would you think it mr town instead of suffering my salute she reclined her head on the chair drew her hand from mine held it up as a bar between us arose and told me i must take no such liberties in future i expostulated and was for attempting again imagining it was only a whim for you well know they all have their whims but to my great misfortune found it was real she resumed her place and in a grave manner told me i must think no more of what had passed between us that she should always have a regard for me but was determined not to marry and therefore expected i should from that time forbear all further pretension i earnestly as you can make no doubt pressed for reasons but could get none except broken hints such as  i would not have you marry  it may hurt your constitution which seems to be very delicate  i cannot turn nurse  we shall not answer each others expectations  and without any further or other ceremony she quitted the room with all the haughty airs of a fine lady who knows she has the man totally in her power  oh mr town imagine what a confused situation i was in i was thunderstruck i was overwhelmed with horror and astonishment i stood like the soldier when he beheld the shocking condition of his general bellisarius after being a long time in that condition i a little recovered my senses and with much difficulty prevailed on her maid to follow her to her retreat and to beg the favor only to speak to her that was denied me i was told her determination was fixed she expected i would obey it and that she should be absent when i came again  i am at present uncertain what to do i shall therefore be obliged to you if you will advise me as i can prove a promise of marriage whether i shall put the affair into the hands of my attorney or whether i shall stay till the warm weather comes which i imagine will carry off my rheumatism and attack her again or whether i shall pocket the disappointment and think no more of matrimony give me some consolation if you can but if you have none i desire for the good of young batchelors like myself you would advise them all between forty and fifty not to wear white stockings in winter  i am sir your constant reader etc timothy doubt   mr town as there are some vices which the vulgar have presumed to copy from the great so there are others which the great have condescended to borrow from the vulgar among these i cannot but set down the blackguard practice for so i must call it of cursing and swearing a practice which to say nothing at present of its profaneness is low and indelicate and places a man of quality on the same level with the chairman at his door for my own part i cannot see the difference between a by gad or a demme minced and softened by a gentle pronunciation from wellbred lips and the same expression bluntly bolted out from the broad mouth of a carman or an oysterwench  your predecessor the spectator has given us an account of a select party of swearers who were extremely surprised at their own common talk which was taken down in shorthand and afterward repeated to them in like manner if we were to draw out a catalogue of fashionable oaths and curses in present use at arthurs or any other polite assembly would not the company themselves be led to imagine that the conversation had been carried on between the lowest of the mob would they not blush to find that they had gleaned their choicest phrases from streets and allies and enriched their discourse by the elegant dialect of wapping or broad saint giless  i shall purposely wave making any reflections on the impiety of this practice as i am satisfied they would have but little weight either with the beaumonde or the canaille the swearer of either station devotes himself piecemeal as it were to destruction pours out anathemas against his eyes his heart his soul and every part of his body and extends the same good wishes to the limbs and joints of his friends and acquaintance this they both do with the same fearless unconcern but with this difference only that the gentlemanswearer damns himself and others with the greatest civility and goodbreeding imaginable  i know it will be pleaded in excuse for this practice that oaths and curses are intended only as mere expletives to fill up and give a grace to conversation but as there are still some oldfashioned creatures who adhere to their common acceptance it would be proper to substitute some other unmeaning terms in their room and at the same time remote from the vulgar cursing and swearing a worthy clergyman whose name i cannot recollect being chaplain of a regiment is said to have reclaimed the officers who were much addicted to the vulgar idiom of swearing by taking occasion to tell them a story in which he introduced the words bottle and glass instead of the usual expletives of god devil and damn which he did not think quite so becoming for one of his cloth to make free with the same method might i imagine be followed by our people of fashion whenever they are obliged to have recourse to the like substitutes for thought bottle and glass might be used with great energy in the tabletalk at the kings arms or saint albans taverns the gamester might be indulged in swearing by the knave of clubs or the curse of scotland or he might with some propriety retain the old execration of the deuce take it the beau should be allowed to swear by his gracious self which is the god of his idolatry and the common expletives of conversation should consist only of upon my word or upon my honor which whatever sense they might formerly bear are at present understood only as words of course without meaning  i am sir your humble servant etc   the connoisseur by mr town critic and censorgeneral number cix thursday february         prudens futuri temporis exitum caliginosa nocte premit deus ridetque si mortalis ultra fas trepidat hor it is not easy for the mind of man to recover itself from any extraordinary panic which has once seized it for this reason we cannot be surprised that many wellmeaning people who have not yet shook off the apprehensions occasioned by the late dreadful earthquakes should be led to conjure up new terrors and alarm themselves with imaginary dangers their fears interpret every common incident and even the change of weather as signs of approaching destruction if the day be calm and serene such they say is the usual forerunner of a shock or if the night prove tempestuous they can hardly persuade themselves that it is only the wind which rocks their houses with this propensity to entertain any unreasonable dread about future events it is no wonder that weak minds should be further worked upon by little dablers in philosophy who having gleaned a few barren scraps from the magazines presume even to foretell the dissolution of the world by the comet which will appear in      swift in his voyage to laputa has a passage so very apposite to these idle pretenders to science that i shall beg leave to transcribe it  these people says he are under continual disquietudes never enjoying a minutes peace of mind and their disturbances proceed from causes which very little affect the rest of mortals their apprehensions arise from several changes they dread in the celestial bodies for instance that the earth by the continual approaches of the sun toward it must in course of time be absorbed or swallowed up that the face of the sun will by degrees be encrusted with its own effluvia and give no more light to the world that the earth very narrowly escaped a brush from the last comet which would have infallibly reduced it to ashes and that the next which they have calculated for one and thirty years hence will probably destroy us for if in its perihelion it should approach within a certain degree of the sun as by their calculations they have reasons to dread it will receive a degree of heat ten thousand times more intense than that of red hot glowing iron and in its absence from the sun carry a blazing tail ten hundred thousand and fourteen miles long through which if the earth should pass at the distance of one hundred thousand miles from the nucleus or main body of the comet it must in its passage be set on fire and reduced to ashes that the sun daily spending its rays without any nutriment to supply them will at last be wholly consumed and annihilated which must be attended with the destruction of this earth and of all the planets that receive their light from it  they are so perpetually alarmed with the apprehensions of these and the like impending dangers that they can neither sleep quietly in their beds nor have any relish for the common pleasures or amusements of life when they meet an acquaintance in the morning the first question is about the suns health how he looked at his setting and rising and what hopes they have to avoid the stroke of an approaching comet this conversation they are apt to run into with the same temper that boys discover to hear terrible stories of spirits and hobgoblins which they greedily listen to and dare not go to bed for fear  let us therefore banish from our thoughts all such vain notions and let us fortify our minds with a true sense of religion which will teach us to rely on the protection of that providence which has hitherto preserved us it is with great pleasure that i remarked the unanimous concurrence of all ranks of people in observing the late solemn fast as a necessary act of humiliation to avert the wrath and vengeance of heaven and to call down its mercies upon us nor do i doubt but the approaching season will awaken in us the same serious attention to our duty that we may not seem to have barely complied with a stated form or to have been affected with the shortlived piety of a single day  it is true indeed that no persons do more prejudice to the cause of religion than they who cloud its genuine cheerfulness with the gloom of superstition and are apt to consider every common accident that befalls us as a judgment they cloth religion in the most terrifying habit and as it were dress it up in all the horrors of the inquisition these people are much to be pitied and it is to be wished that their mistaken piety could be better regulated but there is another set of men of a different turn more numerous and much more dangerous to the community who treat every act of religion as a jest and hold its most sacred ordinances in contempt set forms and ceremonies though they have no essential virtue in themselves are yet indispensably requisite to keep alive in us a quick sense of our duty it must be allowed indeed that if a man could constantly employ his mind in holy meditations exercise the virtues and believe the mysteries of our religion he would be a true christian though he never complied with any outward forms or so much as repeated a single prayer but it is manifest from experience that those who neglect the ordinances neglect also the duties of a christian and the least reflection on the human mind will convince us that some external rites are necessary to settle the wandering ideas and to fix the attention on its proper object the fervent repetition of a prayer is apt to inspire us with love and gratitude toward the deity and kindles the sparks of devotion within us and it is easy to conceive that if the celebration of public worship was neglected among us only for one year it would be a more fatal blow to religion than all the weak attacks of infidels and freethinkers no arguments therefore could be more illgrounded than the objections of those people who considered the appointment of the late solemn fast as useless and unnecessary  but though forms may be said to compose the body a good life is the soul of religion without which the rest is but a dead mass the most rigid compliance with every ordinance of the church if it has no influence on our conduct is rather a solemn mockery than an atonement for our offenses as they who receive the bread and wine without a firm resolution to lead a new life are said to eat and drink their own damnation wherefore a strict observance of this or that particular day is not a sufficient discharge of our duty except it serve to rouse us from the lethargy of sin to awaken in us a desire of becoming worthy the protection of the almighty by animating our faith amending our lives and working in us a repentance of our transgressions thus the lords day is not merely set apart for devotion with an unlimited license to wickedness all the rest of the week but our being particularly exercised in acts of piety for one day is calculated to strengthen our virtue and to give a tincture of religion to our whole conduct through the other six  these considerations i have thought fit to lay before the reader as preparatory to another solemn fast ordained by the church and if the observance of this should be neglected or slightly passed over may we not conclude that our sense of religion is only in proportion to our sense of danger as for those who require constantly to be frightened into their duty i will for once venture to commence prophet and let them be assured that my predictions will infallibly come to pass there is a danger more certain than an earthquake or a comet which will inevitably overwhelm us from which we cannot possibly guard ourselves and which perhaps is even now at our doors this danger i cannot better set forth than in the alarming words of a celebrated french preacher i know a man and i will point him out presently who is now in this church a man in perfect health a man in the flower of his age and yet this man perhaps before next sunday perhaps by tomorrow will be in his grave this man my dear brethren is myself who speak to you it is you who hear me  the connoisseur by mr town critic and censorgeneral number cx thursday march        hoc opus hoc studium parvi properemus et ampli si volumus patriae si nobis vivere chart hor to mr town sir every englishman who has the good of his country at heart must lament the perplexity which our ministers labor under in contriving ways and means to raise money for the present exigence of affairs i have with pleasure hearkened to the several projects proposed in the debates of patriots in our coffeehouses and private clubs but though i find they are unanimous in allowing the necessity of levying new taxes every one is willing to shift off the burden from himself  i was introduced the other night into a set of worthy citizens who very zealously took this subject into consideration over their evening pipe one of them a grave gentleman pulling the evening post out of his pocket and putting on his spectacles read aloud to us the several methods already proposed to which many wise objections were immediately started by the company what is that says an old don who i afterward found had a small estate in houses an additional duty upon bricks and pantiles and plaintiles i suppose they will lay a tax upon plaintilepegs by and bye this speech was received with an hearty chuckle of applause from the rest of the company when another took occasion to observe that he very much approved the scheme for laying a larger tax upon cards and dice one of which he called the devils books and the other his bones the duty upon plate might perhaps have passed into a law in this assembly if it had not been vehemently opposed by one member whom i discovered to be a silversmith in which he was seconded by the landlord of the house who had a seat in this meeting and told us that it would lie very hard upon publicans as nobody would now drink their porter out of a pewterpot these and the like arguments induced us to set aside all the projects that had been offered hitherto and to consult together in order to find new ones in their room among which i could not but smile at the proposal of an honest perukemaker who advised the levying of a polltax upon all that wore their own hair for says he we have never had good times since wigs were out of fashion what rare days were those in queen annes reign when the nobility and gentry wore large flaxen flows of thirty guineas price and as you may see in my lord godolphins monument in westminster abbey a prime ministers wig could not be made i am sure under fifty guineas  the discourse that passed at this society of politicians has led me to turn my thoughts on devising some method that might answer the present demands for a supply with the least injury to the community on this account i am of opinion that private vices according to the favorite tenet of maunderville may in some measure be converted into public benefits by laying a certain tax or duty on the fashionable amusements of the gay and polite world for this purpose i have with great pains and labor contrived a plan a few heads of which without further preface i shall with your leave submit to the consideration of those whom it may concern  first then i would propose that no persons of quality or others should be allowed to keep any route drum assembly visitingday or whatever other name it may hereafter be called by at which more than one hundred persons shall be found assembled without paying a certain rate for every such route drum etc the number of these meetings which are held in this town including the city of london and the suburbs thereof i have computed upon an exact calculation to amount annually to eight thousand three hundred and upwards so that if a duty at only sixpence per head were to be levied upon the company it would bring in a prodigious income to the government deducting for the decrease consequent of this tax as also for those which we may expect will be smuggled or carried on clandestinely and as gaming is an essential diversion at all these meetings i would further advise that every cardtable be marked and numbered in the same manner as wagons and coaches and a proportionable rate fixed on them according to the degree and quality of the owners be it enacted moreover that extraordinary licenses shall be taken out for playing at cards on the sabbath day but that these be granted only to persons of the highest rank and fashion  at the present juncture of affairs every one will agree with me that if an absolute prohibition be impracticable an heavy duty should be laid on the importation of french fashions and fopperies into this kingdom it is therefore but reasonable that all french cooks valets de chamber milliners mantuamakers haircutters etc should be at least doubly taxed as it is notorious that they exact from the dupes who employ them more than double the wages or price for their labors that our own modest countrymen would require this tax i make no doubt would produce no inconsiderable sum for the public use and as our ladies though i would not suspect that they have french hearts are ambitious of wearing french complexions a further sum might also be raised by fixing an high duty upon rouge and carmine  i shall not dwell on other particulars which might be turned in the same manner to the public good such as a tax on kept mistresses for example which practice is now become so generally fashionable that i question not but a duty properly levied on them would be sufficient to maintain all the widows of our soldiers and sailors who shall happen to be killed in the service but as it is incumbent on every englishman to expose his life in defense of his country against the common enemy i must particularly recommend that some means may be devised that the gallant feats of those men of honor who rather choose to risk their lives in the modish way of duelling may be attended with some advantage to their countrymen i would therefore advise that swords and pistols of a settled length and bore with the towerstamp be provided by the government for the use of duellists and that they shall not presume to make use of any other under pain of incurring the guilt of murder these weapons may be let out at a certain price and if one of the parties happen to kill the other the survivor shall be subject to a fine according to his rank and station and a jury shall be directed to bring in the verdict selfdefence in like manner persons of quality may have leave granted them to put an end to their own lives after an ill luck at cards or the like emergent occasions when upon paying a certain rate they may be indulged in a private execution from the hands of jack ketch and the coroners inquest shall be directed to bring in their verdict lunacy  i am sir your humble servant etc   to mr town sir as you are a connoisseur i shall make no apology for desiring

of the young unmarried ladies of the present age dislike no company so much as the elderly persons of their own sex whether married or unmarried going with an old maiden aunt a mamma or grandmamma to the play or to ranelagh is so insipid an amusement that it robs their entertainment of the very name of a party of pleasure to be handed into a box walk in the public gardens or make one at a cardtable at a route with a sprightly young nobleman or gallant colonel of the guards has some life in it but to be kept perpetually under the wing of an old lady can have no charms for a woman of spirit the presence of these antiquated females imposes a constraint on their behavior they are indeed like the duennas in spain spies on the conduct of the gay and young and a good old gentlewoman with a young beauty by her side watches her every motion and is as much frighted if the pretty creature makes any advances to a man as a hen who has been fostermother to a brood of ducklings is alarmed at their taking to the water  but though a loose coquet behavior is so much in vogue a modest deportment is most natural and becoming in the fair sex and i am always glad to see a young lady of sufficient sense and discretion to behave with an innocent cheerfulness instead of apparent uneasiness and constraint before her more aged female friends and relations but though a daughter should prefer no company to her mother a son would appear as ridiculous if he always dangled at the side of his mamma as if he wore his sisters petticoats and however amiable this maidenly demeanor might seem in a young girl i cannot view it with equal approbation in the character of a malevirgin  a character with which i shall here present the reader as drawn by one of my correspondents  to mr town sir you have already given us several instances of those ambiguous creatures among the men who are both male and female permit me to add to them an account of those ladylike gentlemen whom we may distinguish by the title of their mothers own sons who have in vain changed the bib and leadingstrings for the breeches and stick as close to their mammas as a great calf to the side of an old cow i am intimately acquainted with one of these overgrown babies who is indeed too big to be dandled in lap or fed with a papspoon though he is no more weaned from his mother than if he had not yet quitted the nursery  the delicate billy suckling is the contempt of the men the jest of the women and the darling of his mamma she doats on him to distraction and is in perpetual admiration of his wit and anxiety for his health the good young gentleman for his part is neither undutiful nor ungrateful she is the only woman that he does not look on with indifference and she is his tutoress his physician and his nurse she provides his broth every evening will not suffer him to look into a book by candlelight lest he should hurt his eyes and takes care to have his bed warmed nay i have known him sit with his mammas white handkerchief round his neck through a whole visit to guard him from the wind of that ugly door or that terrible chink in the wainscot  but however familiarly he may behave in his addresses to his mother and whatever little acts of gallantry may pass between them no encouragement can prevail on him to treat other women with the same freedom being once desired at a ball to dance a minuet instead of taking out any of the young ladies he could pitch upon no partner so agreeable to whom he might offer the compliment of his hand as his mother and i remember when he was once called upon in a large company at a tavern to give a lady in his turn he plainly showed who was the sole mistress of his affections by toasting his mother the gallant custom of challenging a lady to drink a bumper by leaving it to her option whether she will have hob or nob frequently gives a delicious flavor to the liquor especially when as i have known it happen joining the lips of the glasses has made the prelude to a meeting between the lips of the parties but he could not be prevailed on to accept a glass of claret from the fairest hand though a kiss were sure to follow it i have known him so very nice as to refuse a glass of sack filled with walnuts which had been peeled by the snowy fingers of a beautiful young lady though i have seen him smack his lips after a glass of raisin wine in which his prudent mother had been dabbling with her snuffy finger in order to fish out the small particles of cork which might possibly have choked him if a lady drops her fan he sits without any emotion and suffers her to stoop for it herself or if she strikes her teacup against the saucer to give notice that it is empty he pays no regard to the signal but sees her walk up to the teatable without stirring from his chair he would rather leave the most celebrated beauty in crossing the street to the mercy of a drayman than trust her with his little finger though at the same time should his mother be so distressed he would not scruple to bear as much of her weight as he could stand under and to redeem her silk stockings from jeopardy would even expose his own  one would imagine that this extreme coyness and reserve in which he so remarkably differs from the generality of his own sex would in another respect as effectually distinguish him from the generality of women i mean that being less polite in his address than a footman we should hardly expect to find him more loquacious than a chambermaid but this is really the case suffer him to take the lead in conversation and there are certain topics in which the most prating gossip at a christening would find it difficult to cope with him the strength of his constitution is his favorite theme he is constantly attempting to prove that he is not susceptible of the least injury from cold though a hoarseness in his voice and the continual interruptions of a consumptive cough give him the lie in his throat at the end of every sentence the instances indeed by which he endeavors to prove his hardiness unluckily rather tend to convince us of the delicacy of his frame as they seldom amount to more than his having kicked off the bedchoaths in his sleep laid aside one of his flannel waistcoats in a hot day or tried on a new pair of pumps before they had been sufficiently aired for the truth of these facts he always appeals to his mamma who vouches for him with a sigh and protests that his carelessness would ruin the constitution of a horse  i am now coming to the most extraordinary part of his character this pusillanimous creature thinks himself and would be thought a buck the noble fraternity of that order find that their reputation can be no otherwise maintained than by prevailing on an irish chairman now and then to favor them with a broken head or by conferring the same token of their esteem on the unarmed and defenseless waiters at a tavern but these exploits are by no means suited to the disposition of our hero and yet he always looks upon his harmless exploits as the bold frolicks of a buck if he escapes a nervous fever a month he is quite a buck if he walks home after it is dark without his mammas maid to attend him he is quite a buck if he sits up an hour later than his usual time or drinks a glass or two of wine without water he calls it a debauch and because his head does not ache the next morning he is quite a buck in short a woman of the least spirit within the precincts of st jamess would demolish him in a week should be pretend to keep pace with her in her irregularities and yet he is ever dignifying himself with the appellation of a buck  now might it not be giving this gentleman a useful hint mr town to assure him that while milk and water is his darling liquor a bamboo cane his club and his mother the sole object of his affections the world will never join in denominating him a buck that if he fails in this attempt he is absolutely excluded from every order in society for whatever his deserts may be no assembly of antiquated virgins can ever acknowledge him for a sister nature having as deplorably disqualified him for that rank in the community as he has disqualified himself for every other and that though he never can arrive at the dignity of leading apes in hell he may possibly be condemned to dangle in that capacity at the apronstring of an old maid in the next world for having so abominably resembled one in this  i am sir your humble servant etc   the connoisseur by mr town critic and censorgeneral number cxii thursday march         aureus axis erat temo aureus aurea summae curvatura rotae radiorum argenteus ordo per juga chrysolithi positaeque ex ordine gemmae ovid to mr town sir it has for a long time been observable that the ladies heads have run much upon wheels but of late there has appeared a strange kind of inversion for the wheels now run upon the ladies heads as this assertion may probably puzzle many readers who pay no attention to the rapid and whimsical revolutions of modern taste it will be necessary to inform them that instead of a cap the present mode is for every female of fashion to load her head with some kind of carriage whether they are made with broad wheels or not i cannot determine however as they are undoubtedly excluded the turnpike act it is by no means material those heads which are not able to bear a coach and six for vehicles of this sort are very apt to crack the brain so far act consistently with prudence as to make use of a post chariot or a single horse chaise with a beau perching in the middle  the curiosity i had of knowing the purport of this invention and the general name of these machines led me to make enquiry about them of a fashionable milliner at the court end of the town she obliged me with the sight of one of these equipages designed for the head of a lady of quality which i surveyed with much admiration and placing it on the palm of my hand could not help fancying myself like gulliver taking up the empress of lilliput in her statecoach the vehicle itself was constructed of gold threads and was drawn by six dapple greys of blown glass with a coachman postilion and gentleman within of the same brittle manufacture upon further enquiry the milliner told me with a smile that it was difficult to give a reason for inventions so full of whim but that the name of this ornament if it may be called such was a capriole or cabriole which we may trace from the same original with our english word caprice both being derived from the french word cabrer which signifies to prance like an horse  it is not to be doubted but that this fashion took its rise among the ladies from their fondness for equipage and i dare say that every fair one who carries a coach and six upon her head would be glad to be carried with equal splendour in a coach of her own i would therefore propose a scheme which might render this whimsical mode of some kind of service to both sexes by which the ladies may give a tacit hint of their inclinations without the least breach of modesty the men may prevent the danger and inconvenience attending the present method of advertising for wives and the whole course of a modern courtship may be carried on by means of this new headdress  instead of a capriole suppose this capital decoration was called a scutcheon of pretense which must not here be understood as a term of heraldry but as an invitation to matrimony thus if a lady presumes that she has a right either from her wit beauty merit or fortune to pretend to a set of horses let six bright bays blacks or greys prance down one side of her head and according to the rank she insists upon let a ducal or an earls coronet or a bloody hand be distinguished upon her capriole the females of less ambition may likewise express their inclinations by a postchariot and pair and even those who from a due consideration of the low condition of the funds are so condescending as to stoop to a plain cit have nothing to do but to fix upon their heads a single horse chaise filled with a loving couple sticking as close together as two dried figs as to those who have rashly vowed virginity if their great proneness to censure the rest of their sex and the fretfulness of their aspect be not sufficient indications to keep the men at a distance they may erect upon their noddles a formal female seated in a sulky foolishly pleased with having the whole vehicle to herself and awkwardly exercising the imaginary power of having the sole command of the reins  as a farther means of facilitating this new method of courtship i must beg leave to propose that every ladys bosom should instead of a pendent cross which savours of popery be ornamented with a chain and locket something like those bottletickets which direct us to port claret or burgundy upon which might be curiously engraved the numbers two hundred five hundred or a thousand according to the settlement expected but to those female quixotes who scorn the capriole and erect windmills upon their heads instead of it i shall offer a word of advice worthy their attention which is that they would provide a pipe of communication to be conveyed from these machines to the brain and constituted upon the model of the ingenious dr hales ventilators that whenever the sails of the windmill are put into motion by the external air they may draw off all pernicious vapors which may occasion a vertigo in the inside as well as on the outside of their heads  i am sir your humble servant h   i am much pleased with the proposal of my ingenious correspondent and think it particularly well adapted to the present disposition of the ladies a fondness for showy equipages is now become one of their darling passions and the splendour in which they are to be maintained seems to be one of the chief considerations in modern matches if a fine lady can be carried to court in a chair richly ornamented or roll to the opera in a gilt chariot she little considers with how disagreeable a companion she goes through the journey of life and a polite female would no more fix her affections on a man who drives but a beggarly pair than she could be content to be tumbled down to his country seat like punchs wife to rumford in a wheelborrow  but as the ladies have strongly manifested this passion for equipage the gentlemen i suppose out of mere gallantry and in order to further the gratification of their desires have taken great pains to convert themselves into coachmen grooms and jockies the flapped hat the jemmy frock with plate buttons and a leathern belt and the pride which some young men of quality take in driving are all calculated the better to qualify them for being the ladies humble servants i am therefore for extending my correspondents scheme and as the ladies now adorn their heads with the sign of a coach and six like the door of a meuse alehouse i would have the gentlemen also bear these emblematical vehicles by which the other sex may by a single glance at a lovers head see in what state they will be supported as we know a clergyman by his rose or an officer by his cockade  the pretty fellows who study dress might show a great deal of invention in suiting their caprioles to their circumstances any nobleman or gentleman who has the honor to be a knowing one might show his affection for the turf by carrying the horse and jockey another who is an excellent driver might bear his own figure exalted in a phaeton and a third who thinks of picking up a partner for life that can be pleased with a teteatete or sober picpuet party with her husband may bear a visavis in a word all the different proposals of various suitors might be made by means of these ornaments which might be worn over the foreheads of the beaux like the white horse in the grenadiers caps and the ladies might be as much smitten with a promising capriole on the head of a lover as heretofore with an elegant perriwig  if this mode should prevail the concluding a treaty of marriage between two persons of quality might be considered in the same light and expressed in the same terms as making a match at new market and instead of the hackneyed phrases at present used by our newswriters we might perhaps see the important articles in the public papers concerning marriages drawn up after the following manner  we hear that a match will be shortly made between the mourning coach and six of a merchants widow with a great jointure and an hunter in fine order belonging to a younger brother of a noble family  a running horse highly valued for his blood is expected to start soon with a young filly from yorkshire many thousand pounds are depending on this match  a few days ago a young fellow from ireland mounted on a single horse attacked an heiress in her coach and six the lady made little or no resistance and suffered herself to be taken out of the coach and carried off behind him  a gay coach and six belonging to a young heir just of age came to town last week in great splendour and was intended to be matched with an equipage of the same kind but having unfortunately run against arthurs chocolatehouse it broke down and the owner was very much hurt  we hear from bath that the postchaise of a young lady of great beauty lately made its appearance in the long room and soon after went off with the landau of a neighboring country squire  we are also informed from the same place that an oldfashioned twowheel chaise with a single horse contrived to hold only one person had drove about the walks for some time but having jostled against the sulky of an old bachelor in his grand climacteric it was judged expedient to join them together when they formed a most agreeable visavis for the mutual accommodation of both parties  the connoisseur by mr town critic and censorgeneral number cxiii thursday march         o sanctas gentes quibus haec nascuntur in

themselves for connoisseurs these sort of students become sufficiently acquainted with the customs of the ancients to learn the least interesting particulars concerning them they can distinguish a tiberius from a trajan know the pantheon from the amphitheatre and can explain the difference between the praetexta and the tunica which only supposing the present times to have elapsed some hundred years is just as deep knowledge as if some future antiquarian should discover the difference between a carolus and an anna or st pauls church and drury lane playhouse or a fulltrimmed suit and a french frock  but the full display of modern polite learning is exhibited in the decorations of parks gardens etc and centered in that important monosyllable taste taste comprehends the whole circle of the polite arts and sheds its influence on every lawn avenue grassplat and parterre taste has peopled the walks and gardens of the great with more numerous inhabitants than the ancient satyrs fauns and dryads while infidelity has expunged the christian theology from our creed taste has introduced the heathen mythology into our gardens if a pond is dug neptune at the command of taste emerges from the basin and presides in the middle or if a vista is cut through a grove it must be terminated by a flora or an apollo as the ancients held that every spot of ground had its guardian genius and that woodland deities were pegged in the knotty entrails of every tree so in the gardens laid out by modern taste every walk is peopled with gods and goddesses and every corner of it has its tutelardeity temples are erected to all the train of gods and goddesses mentioned in homer or ovid which edifices as well as their several statues are adorned with latin or greek inscriptions while the learned owner wonders at his own surprising stock of literature which he sees drawn out at large before him like the whole knowledge of an apothecary inscribed upon his gallipots  these persons of taste may be considered as a sort of learned idolaters since they may be almost said to adore these graven images and are quite enthusiastic in their veneration of them the following letter may possibly give them some offense but as i have myself no extravagant fondness for a jupiter tonans or a belvidere apollo i heartily wish the scheme proposed by my correspondent may take place though it should reduce the price of heathen godheads  to mr town sir at a time when all wise heads are considering of ways and means to raise taxes that may prove the least oppressive to indigence and most effectually restrictive of luxury permit me to propose as a supplement to the thoughts of one of your correspondents on this subject a national tax upon gods  it is a strange but an undeniable truth mr town that if you and i were to travel through england and to visit the citizen in his country box the nobleman at his seat the esquire at the hallhouse and even the divine at his parsonage we should find the gardens avenues and groves belonging to each mansion stuffed and ornamented with heathen gods  in the present declining state of our established religion i almost tremble to consider what may be the consequences of these readymade deities far be it from me to suppose that the great and the rich will worship any god whatsoever but still i am induced to fear that the poor and the vulgar when they find all other worship ridiculed and laid aside may foolishly take to these molten images and adore every leaden godhead they can find if a tax on wheels has put down some hundreds of coaches by a parity of reason a tax upon gods may pull down an equal if not a greater number of statues i would also offer another proposal which is this that an oak be immediately planted wherever a statue has been taken away by which means those vast woods which of late years have been cut down in england to supply the immediate necessities of the illustrious arthurites in st jamessstreet may be in some measure supplied to future generations  among our present taxes some of them fall upon branches of splendour not totally luxurious wheel carriages may be necessary want of health or lameness of limbs may require them but what necessities can we pretend for statues in our gardens penates in our libraries and lares on every chimneypiece i have remarked many wild whims of this kind that have appeared submissions if not attachments to idolatry a gentleman of my acquaintance has destroyed his chapel merely because he could not put up statues in it and has filled his garden with every god that can be found in spences polymetis another of my friends after having placed a belvidere apollo very conspicuously and naked upon the top of a mount has erected an obelisk to the sun and this expense he has not put himself to for the beauty of the obelisk for it is not beautiful nor again for the splendour of the planet which is of pewter double gilt but only because being in possession of copies or originals of every deity that greece or italy could boast he was resolved to have the god of persia to complete his collection a polltax therefore upon gods and goddesses be their representation what it will suns dogs moons or monkies is absolutely necessary and would infallibly bring in a large revenue to the state  happening to be the other day at slaughters coffeehouse in st martins lane i saw two very fine statues of fame and fortune brought out of mr roubilliacs gate and exposed to view before they were nailed up and carted the boy of the house told us they were to be placed upon the top of sir thomas  s chapel in hampshire is it for such as these observed a sneering papist who stood near me that crucifixes have been removed and that reverend saints and martyrs have been destroyed and pounded into dust is it for these that st peter has been broken to pieces and st paul melted down into water pipes must our lady make room for proserpine and the holy giant st christopher fall a victim to the farnesian hercules will you not agree with me sir continued he that as men are induced and almost constrained to judge of others by their own manners and inclinations we who are supposed to worship the images of christians must naturally conclude that the protestants of the church of england worship the images of heathens i confess i was at a loss how to answer the acuteness of his questions and must own that i cannot help thinking st anthony preaching to the fishes or st dunstan taking the devil by the nose as proper ornaments for a chapel as any pagan deities whatever  hitherto i have kept you entirely among the molten images without doors but were we to enter the several mansions whose avenues and demesnes are adorned in the manner i describe we should find every chamber a pagod filled with all the monstrous images that the idolatry of india can produce i will not presume to infer that the ladies address kitoos prayers which the japanese make use of in time of public distress to their ingens but i am apt to surmise that in times of danger and invasion some of your fair readers would be more alarmed at the french approach to their china than to their chapels and would sooner give up a favorite lapdog than a grotesque chimneypiece figure of a chinese saint with numberless heads and arms i have not yet digested my thoughts in what manner the fair sex ought to be taxed it is a tender point and requires consideration at present i am of opinion they ought to be spared and the whole burden entirely laid upon those bramins and imams whose idolatrous temples lie publicly open to our streets  i am sir your most humble servant moses orthodox   the connoisseur by mr town critic and censorgeneral number cxiv thursday april        vesanum tetigisse timent fugiuntque poetam hor i remember when i was very young a relation carried me to visit a gentleman who had wrote some pieces that had been very well received and made me very happy by promising to introduce me to an author as soon as i came i surveyed his whole person from top to toe with the strictest attention sat openmouthed to catch every syllable that he uttered and noticed his voice manner and every word and gesture with the minutest observation i could not help whispering to myself the whole evening i am in company with an author and waited with the most anxious impatience to hear him deliver something that might distinguish him from the rest of mankind the gentleman behaved with great cheerfulness and politeness but he did not at all answer the idea which i had conceived of an author and i went away exceedingly disappointed because i could not find any striking difference between him and the rest of my acquaintance  there is no character in human life which is the subject of more frequent speculation among the vulgar than an author some look on him with contempt and others with admiration but they all agree in believing him to be something different from all other people and it is remarkable with what greediness they attend to any little anecdotes which they can pick up concerning his life and conversation he is indeed a kind of an ideal being of which people conceive very different notions by some he is supposed never to stir out of a garret to wear a rusty black coat dirty shirt and darned stockings and to want all the necessaries as well as conveniences of life while others regard him as a creature superior to the rest of mortals and endowed with something more than reason one part therefore is surprised to see him walk abroad and appear as well dressed as other people and another is disappointed when they find him talk and act and fill the offices of life no better than any other common man  nor is it less curious to consider the different ideas they conceive of the manner in which the business of writing is executed the novice in literature smit with the love of sacred song but not yet dipped in ink supposes it all rapture and enthusiasm and in imagination sees the author running wildly about his room talking poetry to the chairs and tables while the mechanic considers him as working at his trade and thinks he can set down to write whenever he pleases as easily as the smith can labor at his forge or a carpenter plane a board indeed he regards the author with some veneration as a scholar but writing appears to him a mighty easy business and he smiles whenever he hears any body mention the labor of it nor has he the least conception of the minds being fatigued with thinking and the fancy harrassed with persuing a long train of ideas  as people are led frequently to judge of a man from his ordinary conversation so it is common for them to form an idea of the authors disposition from the peculiar turn and color of his writings they expect a gloom to be spread over the face of a mathematician a controversial writer must be given to wrangling and dispute and they imagine that a satirist must be made up of spleen envy and ill nature but this criterion is by no means certain and determinate i know an author of a tragedy who is the merriest man living and one who has wrote a very witty comedy though he will sit an hour in company without speaking a word lord buckhurst is celebrated for being the best good man with the worstnatured muse and mr addison was remarkably shy and reserved in conversation i remember i once fell into company with a painter a poet a divine and a physician who were no less famous for their wit and humor than for their excellence in their several professions after the usual common topics were discussed the physician and the poet fell into a dispute concerning predestination the divine smoked his pipe quietly without putting in a word while the painter and myself formed a privy council for the good of the nation thus were it possible to conjure up the spirits of the most eminent wits in former ages and put them together they would perhaps appear to be very dull company virgil and addison would probably sit staring at each other without opening their mouths horace and steel would perhaps join in commendation of the liquor and swift would in all likelihood divert himself with sucking his cheeks drawing figures in the wine spilt upon the table or twirling the corkscrew round his finger  the strange prejudices which some persons conceive against authors deter many a youth from drawing his pen in the service of literature or if he ventures to commit a favorite work to the press he steals to the printers with as much caution and privacy as he would perhaps on another occasion to a surgeon he is afraid that he shall injure his character by being known to have written any thing and that the genteel part of his acquaintance will despise him as a low wretch as soon as they discover him to be an author as if merely the appearing in print was a disgrace to a gentleman and the imprimatur to his works was no more than a stamp of shame and ignominy these are the terrors which at first disturb the peace of almost every author and have often put me in mind of the exclamation of that writer who cried out o that mine enemy had written a book  these fearful apprehensions are perhaps no unlucky drawback on the vanity natural to all authors which undoubtedly they often conceal or suppress out of deference to the world but if this false modesty is too much cherished it must of course damp all genius and discourage every literary undertaking why should it be disgraceful to exert the noblest faculties given us by nature and why should any man blush at acquitting himself well in a work which there is scarce one in five hundred has a capacity to perform even supposing an author to support himself by the profit arising from his works there is nothing more dishonest scandalous or mean in it than an officer in the army the politest of all professions living on his commission sense and genius are as proper commodities to traffic in as courage and an author is no more to be condemned as an hackney scribbler though he writes at the rate of so much per sheet than a colonel should be despised as a mercenary and a bravo for exposing himself to be slashed stuck and shot at for so much per day the truth is that authors themselves often create the evils they complain of and bring a disgrace on the service of literature by being ashamed to wear the badge of it voltaire in his letters on the english relates a remarkable instance of this kind of false pride in our own congreve voltaire when he was in england waited on congreve and told him that he was glad of an opportunity of paying his respects to a writer so much celebrated for his wit and humor congreve received him politely enough but told him that he should be glad to see him as a common gentleman but would not be considered or conversed with as an author the french writer was a good deal surprised at such a ridiculous piece of delicacy and could not help telling him that he thought this nicety something extraordinary for that if he had been no more than a common gentleman he should never have had any desire of seeing him  i have often pleased myself with reflecting on the different opinions which my readers must have formed of me since my first appearance as an author as poverty is one of the general characteristics of our brotherhood those who indulge themselves in a contempt of writers have i doubt not often painted me to their own imagination in a very grotesque taste their ideal caricatures have perhaps often represented me lodged at least three stories from the ground composing dissertations on the modern taste in architecture at another time i may have been delineated sitting in a tattered nightgown and the breeches of a heathen philosopher writing satires on the present modes in dress and sometimes perhaps they have figured me half starved for want of a hearty meal penning invectives against luxury and debauchery  but while these have reduced me to this low condition and steeped me in poverty to the very lips i flatter myself that some few have bestowed on me an extraordinary share of virtue and understanding after so many grave lessons against the vices and luxury of the present age they will naturally suppose that i never risked a farthing at the gamingtable never kept a mistress would decline an invitation to a turtlefeast and rather than be provoked to fight a duel would take a kick on the breech or tweak by the nose with all the calmness and resignation imaginable as to my wit and humor i should blush to set down the many compliments i have had from several unknown correspondents on that head and i once received a note from a very honest gentleman who desired to spend an evening with me promising himself great diversion in cracking a bottle with the facetious mr town  these various opinions of me as an author i shall never labor to reconcile but shall be equally contented with instructing or amusing the gentle reader whether he considers my papers as favors showered down upon him from a booksellers garret in grub street or issuing from my own apartment however this may be i shall never think it a disgrace to have written or be ashamed to be considered as an author and if ever mr voltaire should think proper to visit england again i shall be very glad of a literary chat with him and will give him a very gracious reception  the connoisseur by mr town critic and censorgeneral number cxv thursday april        caelebs quid agam hor to mr town april        sir no man is a sincerer friend to innocent pleasantry or more desirous of promoting it than myself raillery of every kind provided it be confined within due bounds is in my opinion an excellent ingredient in conversation and i am never displeased if i can contribute to the harmless mirth of the company by being myself the subject of it but in good truth i have neither a fortune a constitution nor a temper that will enable me to chuckle and skake my sides while i suffer more from the festivity of my friends than the spleen or malice of my enemies could possibly inflict upon me nor do i see any reason why i should so far move the mirthful indignation of the ladies as to be teized and worried to death in mere sport for no earthly reason but that i am what the world calls an old bachelor  the female part of my acquaintance entertain an odd opinion that a bachelor is not in fact a rational creature at least that he has not the sense of feeling in common with the rest of mankind that a bachelor may be beat like a stock fish that you may thrust pins into his legs and wring him by the nose in short that you cannot take too many liberties with a bachelor i am at a loss to conceive on what foundation these romping philosophers have grounded their hypothesis though at the same time i am a melancholy proof of it is existence as well as of it is absurdity  a friend of mine whom i frequently visit has a wife and three daughters the youngest of which has persecuted me these ten years these ingenious young ladies have not only found out the sole end and purpose of my being themselves but have likewise communicated their discovery to all the girls in the neighborhood so that if they happen at any time to be apprized of my coming which i take all possible care to prevent they immediately dispatch half a dozen cards to their faithful allies to beg the favor of their company to drink coffee and help teaze mr ironside upon these occasions my entry into the room is sometimes obstructed by a cord fastened across the bottom of the doorcase which as i am a little nearsighted i seldom discover till it has brought me upon my knees before them while i am employed in brushing the dust from my black rollers or chasing my broken shins my wig is suddenly conveyed away and either stuffed behind the lookingglass or tossed from one to the other so dexterously and with such velocity that after many a fruitless attempt to recover it i am obliged to sit down bareheaded to the great diversion of the spectators the last time i found myself in these distressful circumstances the eldest girl a sprightly mischievous jade stepped briskly up to me and promised to restore my wig if i would play her a tune on a small flute she held in her hand i instantly applied it to my lips and blowing lustily into it to my inconceiveable surprise was immediately choked and blinded with a cloud of soot that issued from every hole in the instrument the younger part of the company declared i had not executed the conditions and refused to surrender my wig but the father who had a rough kind of facetiousness about him insisted on it is being delivered up and protested that he never knew the black joke better performed in his life  i am naturally a quiet inoffensive animal and not easily ruffled yet i shall never submit to these indignities with patience till i am satisfied i deserve them even the old maids of my acquaintance who one would think might have a fellowfeeling for a brother in distress conspire with their nieces to harrass and torment me and it is not many nights since miss diana grizzle utterly spoiled the only superfine suit i have in the world by pinning the skirts of it together with a redhot poker i own my resentment of this injury was so strong that i determined to punish it by kissing the offender which in cool blood i should never have attempted the satisfaction however which i obtained by this imprudent revenge was much like what a man of honor feels on finding himself run through the body by the scoundrel who had offended him my upper lip was transfixed with a large corkin pin which in the scuffle she had conveyed into her mouth and i doubt not that i shall carry the memorem labris natam from an old maid to the grave with me  these misfortunes or others of the same kind i encounter daily but at these seasons of the year which give a sanction to this kind of practical wit and when every man thinks he has a right to entertain himself at his friends expense i live in hourly apprehensions of more mortifying adventures no miserable dunghillcock devoted a victim to the wanton cruelty of the mob would be more terrified at the approach of a shrovetuesday were he endued with human reason and forecast than i am at the approach of a merry christmas or the first of april no longer ago than last thursday which was the latter of these festivals i was pestered with mortifying presents from the ladies obliged to pay the carriage of half a dozen oysterbarrels stuffed with brickbats and ten pacquets by the post containing nothing but old newspapers but what vexed me the most was the being sent fifty miles out of town on that day by a counterfeit express from a dying relation  i could not help reflecting with a sigh on the resemblance between the imaginary grievance of poor tom in the tragedy of lear and those which i really experienced i like him was led through ford and whirlpool over bog and quagmire and though knives were not laid under my pillow minced horsehair was strewed upon my sheets like him i was made to ride on a hard trotting horse through the most dangerous ways and found at the end of my journey that i had only been coursing my own shadow  as much a sufferer as i am by the behavior of the women in general i must not forget to remark that the pertness and sauciness of an old maid is particularly offensive to me i cannot help thinking that the virginity of these ancient misses is at least as ridiculous as my own celibacy if i am to be condemned for having never made an offer they are as much to blame for having never accepted one if i am to be derided for having never married who never attempted to make a conquest they are more properly the objects of derision who are still unmarried after having made so many numberless are the proposals they have rejected according to their own account and they are eternally boasting of the havoc they have formerly made among the knights baronets and squires at bath tunbridge and epsom while a tattered madrigal perhaps a snip of hair or the portrait of a cherrycheeked gentleman in a milkwhite periwig are the only remaining proofs of those beauties which are now withered like the shortlived rose and have only left the virgin thorn remaining  believe me mr town i am almost afraid to trust you with the publication of this epistle the ladies whom i last mentioned will be so exasperated on reading it that i must expect no quarter at their hands for the future since they are generally as little inclined to forgiveness in their old age as they were to pity and compassion in their youth one expedient however is left me and which if put in execution will effectually screen me from their resentment  i shall be happy therefore if by your means i may be permitted to inform the ladies that as fusty an animal as they think me it is not impossible but by a little gentler treatment than i have hitherto met with i may be humanized into a husband as an inducement to them to relieve me from my present uneasy circumstances you may assure them i am rendered so exceeding tractable by the very severe discipline i have undergone that they may mould and fashion me to their minds with ease and consequently that by marrying me a woman will save herself all that trouble which a wife of any spirit is obliged to take with an unruly husband who is absurd enough to expect from her a strict performance of the marriage vow even in the very minute article of obedience that so far from contradicting a lady i shall be mighty well satisfied if she contents herself with contradicting me that if i happen at any time inadvertently to thwart her inclinations i shall think myself rightly served if she boxes my ears spits in my face or treads upon my corns that if i approach her lips when she is not in a kissing humor i shall expect she will bite me by the nose or if i take her by the hand at an improper season that she will instantly begin to pinch scratch and claw and apply her fingers to those purposes which they were

of law physic and divinity as putting them in the high road to acquire one hence it happens that nineteen parts out of twenty of our young men are brought up with a view to lambeth the seals or warwick lane but alas their hopes and expectations of rising by their professions are often frustrated and the surprising numbers engaged in running the same race necessarily jostle one another for though the courts of justice are tolerably supplied with matters of litigation though there are many invalids and valetudinarians and though great part of england is laid out into church preferments yet there is not in all the kingdom sufficient matter for legal contention to employ a tenth part of those who have been trained to engross deeds in their chambers or to harangue at the bar the number of patients bears no proportion to the swarms of the faculty nor would it though a consultation were to sit on every sick man like carrionflies upon a carcass and the prodigious number of reverend divines infinitely exceeds that of those bishoprics deaneries prebends rectories vicarages etc which when they are ordained they conceive it to be part of their holy office to fill from these frequent failures in each of the professions the younger sons of great men often wish they had been permitted to disgrace the family by some mercantile or more plebeian occupation while the son of the mechanic curses the pride of his father who instead of securing him a livelihood in his own business has condemned him to starve in puddingsleeves that he might do honor to his relations by being a gentleman  the three professions being thus crowded with more candidates for business and preferment than can possibly be employed or promoted has occasioned several irregularities in the conduct of the followers of each of them the utter impossibility of supporting themselves in the usual method of practicing law physic or divinity without clients patients or parishioners has induced the laborers in each of those vocations to seek out new veins and branches the young solicitor who finds he has nothing to do now he is out of his clerkship offers his assistance in the transaction of all law affairs by the public papers and like the advertising tailors promises to work cheaper than any of his brethren while the young barrister after having exhibited his tyewig in westminster hall during several terms to no purpose is obliged to forego the hope of rivalling murray and coke and content himself with being the oracle of the courts of jamaica the graduate in medicine finding himself unsolicited for prescription or advice and likely to starve by practicing physic secundum artem flies in the face of the college and professes to cure all diseases by nostrums unmentioned in the dispensatory he commences a thriving quack and soon makes his way through the important medical degrees of walking on foot riding on horseback dispensing his drugs from an onehorsechaise and lastly lolling in a chariot the divine without living cure or lectureship may perhaps incur transportation for illegal marriages set up a theatricaloratorical billingsgatechapel under the shelter of the tolerationact and the butchers of claremarket or kindle the inward light in the bosoms of the saints of moorfields and the magdalens of broad st giless  but notwithstanding these shoots ingrafted as it were into the main body of the professions it is still impossible for the vast multitude of divines lawyers and physicians to maintain themselves at any rate within the pale of their respective employments they have often been compelled at least to call in adventitious ones and have sometimes totally abandoned their original undertakings they have frequently made mutual transitions into the occupations of each other or have perhaps embraced other employments which though distinct from all three and not usually dignified with the title of professions may fairly be considered in that light since they are the sole means of support to many thousands who toiled in vain for a subsistence in the three capital ones on these professions and their various followers i shall here make some observations  the first of these professions is an author the mart of literature is indeed one of the chief resorts of unbeneficed divines and lawyers and physicians without practice there are at present in the world of authors doctors of physic who to use the phrase of one of them have no great fatigue from the business of their profession many clergymen whose sermons are the most inconsiderable part of their compositions and several gentlemen of the inns of court who instead of driving the quill over skins of parchment lead it through all the mazes of modern novels critiques and pamphlets many also have embraced this profession who were never bred to any other and i might also mention the many bankrupt tradesmen and broken artificers who daily enter into this new way of business if by persuing it in the same mechanical manner as their former occupations they might not rather be regarded as following a trade than a profession  the second of these professions is a player the ingenious gentlemen who assume the persons of the drama are composed of as great a variety of characters as those they represent the history of the stage might afford many instances of those who in the trade of death might have slain men who have condescended to deal counterfeit slaughter from their right hands and administer harmless phials and bowls of poison we might read also of persons whose fists were intended to beat the drum ecclesiastic who have themselves become theatrical volunteers in regard to the law many who were originally designed to manifest their talents for elocution in westminster hall have displayed them in drury lane and it may be added on theatrical authority that not even attorneys have this rage withstood but changed their pens for truncheons ink for blood and strange reverse  died for their countrys good i will not so far affront those gentlemen who were at any time engaged in the study of the three honorable professions of law physic and divinity as to suppose that any of them have ever taken up the more fashionable employment of a pimp yet it is certain that this is a very common and lucrative profession and that very many provide themselves with the necessaries of life by administering to the pleasures of others a convenient cousin sister or wife has sometimes proved the chief means of making a fortune and the tongue of slander has often ventured to affirm that the price of procuration has been paid with a place or a bishopric  the most advantageous and genteel of all professions is gaming whoever will make this science his study will find it the readiest way to riches and most certain passport to the best company for the polite world will always admit any one to their society who will condescend to win their money the followers of this profession are very numerous which is indeed no wonder when we reflect on the numbers it supports in ease and affluence at no greater pains than packing the cards or cogging the dice and no more risk than being sometimes tweaked by the nose or kicked out of company besides which this profession daily receives new luster from the many persons of quality that follow it and crowd into it with as much eagerness as into the army among gamesters may also be found lawyers who get more by being masters of all the cases in hoyle than by their knowledge of those recorded in the reportbooks physicians the chief object of whose attention is the circulation of the e o table and divines who we may suppose were hinted at by a famous wit in a certain assembly when among the other benefits resulting from a double tax upon dice he thought fit to enumerate that it might possibly prevent the clergy from playing at backgammon  but the more danger the more honor and therefore no profession is more honorable than that of a highwayman who the followers of this profession are and with what success they practice it i will not pretend to relate as the memoirs of several of them have been already penned by the ordinary of newgate and as it is to be hoped that the lives of all the present practitioners will be written hereafter by that faithful historian i shall therefore only say that the present spirit of dissoluteness and freethinking must unavoidably bring this honorable profession more and more into vogue and that every sessions may soon be expected to afford an instance of a gentlemanhighwayman  the connoisseur by mr town critic and censorgeneral number cxvii thursday april         ergo haud difficile est perituram arcessere summam lancibus oppositis vel matris imagine fracta juv i have often amused myself with considering the mean and ridiculous shifts to which the extravagant are sometimes reduced when the certain supplies of a regular income are exhausted they are obliged to cast about for ready cash and set the invention to work in order to devise the means of repairing their finances such attempts to enlarge their revenue have frequently driven those whose great souls would not be curbed by the straitness of their circumstances into very uncommon undertakings they have sent lords to arthurs and ladies to assemblies or sometimes worse places we may safely conclude that whoever breaks through all economy will soon discard honesty though perhaps it might be deemed scandalum magnatum to aver that prodigal men of quality have often sold their country to redeem their estates and that extravagant ladies have been known to make up the deficiencies of their pinmoney by pilfering and larceny  but one of the first and chief resources of extravagance both in high and low life is the pawnbrokers i never pass by one of these shops without considering them as the repositories of half the jewels plate etc in town it is true indeed that the honest and industrious are sometimes forced to supply their necessities by this method but if we were to enquire to whom the several articles in these miscellaneous warehouses belong we should find the greatest part of them to be the property of the idle and infamous among the vulgar or the prodigal and luxurious among the great and if in imitation of the ancients who placed the temple of honor behind the temple of virtue propriety should be attempted in the situation of pawnbrokers shops they would be placed contiguous to a ginshop as in the ingenious print of hogarth or behind a tavern gaminghouse or bagnio  going home late last saturday night i was witness to a curious dialogue at the door of one of these houses an honest journeyman carpenter whose wife it seems had pawned his best clothes having just received his weeks pay was come to redeem them that he might appear as fine as he usually did on sunday but it being past twelve oclock the man of the house who kept up the conversation by means of a little grate in the door refused to deliver them though the poor carpenter begged hard for his holiday clothes as the morrow was easter sunday this accident led me to reflect on the various persons in town who carry on this kind of commerce with the pawnbrokers and gave occasion to the following dream  i was scarce asleep before i found myself at the entrance of a blind alley which was terminated by a little hatch where i saw a vast concourse of people of different ages sex and condition going in and coming out some of these i observed as they went up very richly dressed and others were adorned with jewels and costly trinkets but i could not help remarking that at their return they were all divested of their finery and several had even their gowns and coats stripped off their backs a lady who strutted up in a rich brocaded suit sneaked back again in an ordinary stuff nightgown a second retreated with the loss of a diamond solitaire and pearl necklace and a third who had bundled up her whole stock of linen scarce escaped with what she had upon her back i observed several gentlemen who brought their sideboards of plate to be melted down as it were into current specie many had their pockets disburthened of their watches and some even among the military gentlemen were obliged to deliver up their swords others of the company marched up heavy laden with pictures household goods and domestic utensils one carried a spit another brandished a gridiron a third flourished a drying pan while a fourth brought to my remembrance the old sign of the dogs head in the porridgepot i saw several trot up merrily with their chairs tables and other furniture but i could not help pitying one poor creature among the rest who after having stripped his whole house even to his featherbed stalked along like a lockpatient wrapped up in the blankets while his wife accompanied him doing penance in the sheets  as i was naturally curious to see the inside of the receptacle where all these various spoils were deposited i stepped up to the hatch and meeting a grave old gentleman at the threshold i desired him to inform me what place it was and what business was transacted there he very courteously took me by the hand and leading me through a dark passage brought me into a spacious hall which he told me was the temple of usury and that he himself was the chief priest of it one part of this building was hung round with all kinds of apparel like the saleshops in monmouth street another was strewn with a variety of goods and resembled the brokers shops in harp alley and another part was furnished with such an immense quantity of jewels and rich plate that i should rather have fancied myself in the church of the lady of loretto all these my guide informed me were the offerings of that crowd which i had seen resorting to this temple the churches in romancatholic countries have commonly a cross fixed upon them the chinese erect dragons and hang bells about their pagods and the turkish mosques have their peculiar hieroglyphics but i could not help taking particular notice that this temple of usury had its vestibule adorned with three wooden balls painted blue the mystery of which i was told was as dark and unfathomable as the pythagorean number or the secret doctrines of trismegist  when i had in some measure satisfied my curiosity in taking a general survey of the temple my instructor led me to an interior corner of it where the most splendid offerings were spread upon a large altar this bauble said he showing me an elegant sprig of diamonds is an aigret sent in last week by a lady of quality who has ever since kept home with her head muffled up in a double clout for a pretended fit of the toothache she has at different times made an offering of all her jewels and besides these her whole wardrobe was very lately lodged here which threw her into an hysteric fever and confined her to her bedgown for upwards of a month those earrings and other jewels are the paraphernalia of a young bride who was so constant a votary to this place that when nothing else remained for an offering she even brought in her weddingring you may be surprised perhaps to behold such a variety of necklaces girdlebuckles solitaires and other female ornaments as are here collected but it is observable that their devotions in the temple of usury have been chiefly encouraged and kept alive by their assisting at the midnight orgies of avarice  nor are the gentlemen continued he less encouragers of our rites that gold watch laid snug for a considerable time in the fob of a young man of quality but it was one night jerked out by a single throw of the dice at a gamingtable and made its way into the pocket of a stranger who placed it here to keep company with several others which have been brought hither on a similar occasion those brilliant buckles once glittered on the shoes of a very pretty fellow who set out last winter on his travels into foreign parts but never got further than boulogne and that sword with the rich fillagree hilt and elegantlyfancied swordknot with gold tassels once dangled at the side of a spirited buck who left it here two years ago when he went off in a great hurry to take possession of a large estate in his native country ireland whence he is not yet returned you may see many others of these instruments of death which rust peacefully in their scabbards as being of no use whatever to their owners that which commonly hangs upon the vacant peg there belongs you must know to a noble captain it is called upon duty once a month and is at this instant mounting guard at st jamess  not far from these rich ornaments hung several embroidered coats laced waistcoats point despagne hats etc this suit said my venerable instructor pointing to one richly embroidered was made up for a noble lord on the last birthday and was conveyed hither the very next morning after it had appeared at court that jemmy waistcoat with the goldworked buttonholes on the next peg was the property of a smart templar who having spent a night out of his chambers sent his waistcoat hither in the morning as a penitential offering by his landlady as to that heap of camblet gowns checked aprons and colored handkerchiefs which you see strung together a little further off they are oblations made here by a sect of maudlin votaries who resort to this temple to pay their devotions to a goddess whom they have christened madam gin but whom they sometimes honor with the more proper appellation of strip me naked  while my conductor was thus relating the history of the various offerings and the persons who had made them he was suddenly called aside to a dark closet several of which were erected near the entrance and appeared not unlike the confessionals of the romish priests these little boxes i found were appointed to receive the votaries who came to pay their devotions and make their offerings but the necessary rites and ceremonies were commonly solemnized with as much caution and privacy as the mysteries of the bona dea among the romans at present however there was a greater noise and hubbub than usual a person of the first rank in the kingdom who had made some very considerable oblations of gold and silver plate was now about to celebrate a feast in honor of bacchus in which these rich utensils would be requisite on which occasion he prayed to have the use of them the chief priest after having received the customary fee granted a dispensation for this purpose and loaded the messengers with a number of wrought ewers vases and chargers at the same time commissioning two or three of the inferior officials of the temple to attend the celebration of the feast and to take care that the plate was duly returned and safely lodged again in the temple  these matters were scarce adjusted before an unexpected incident filled the whole temple with confusion and disturbance a rude tribe of officers broke in upon us put a stop to the rites and seized the chief priest himself charging him with having profaned the place by a crime almost as infamous as sacrilege he was accused of having encouraged robbers to strip the citizens of their most valuable effects and for a small reward to deposit them as offerings the clamor on this occasion was very great and at last one of the officers methought seized me as a party concerned when endeavoring to clear myself and struggling to get out of his clutches i awoke  the connoisseur by mr town critic and censorgeneral number cxviii thursday april         communi sensu plane caret  hor there is no race of people that has been more conspicuous in almost every relation of life than the illustrious family of nonsense in every age of the world they have shone forth with uncommon luster and have made a wonderful progress in all the arts and sciences they have at different seasons delivered speeches from the throne harangued at the bar debated in parliament and gone amazing lengths in philosophical enquiries and metaphysical disquisitions in a word the whole history of the world moral and political is but a cyclopaedia of nonsense for which reason considering the dignity and importance of the family and the infinite service it has been of to me and many of my cotemporaries i have resolved to oblige the public with a kind of abstract of the history of nonsense  nonsense was the daughter of ignorance begot on falsehood many ages ago in a dark cavern in boeotia as she grew up she inherited all the qualities of her parents she discovered too warm a genius to require being sent to school but while other dull brats were poring over an hornbook she amused herself with spreading fantastical lies taught her by her mamma and which have in later ages been familiarly known to us under the names of sham banter and humbug when she grew up she received the addresses and soon became the wife of impudence who he was or of what profession is uncertain some say he was the son of ignorance by another venture and was suffered to become the husband of nonsense in those dark ages of the world as the ptolemies of egypt married their own sisters some record that he was in the army others that he was an interpreter of the laws and others a divine however this was nonsense and impudence were soon inseparably united to each other and became the founders of a more noble and numerous family than any yet preserved on any tree of descent whatsoever of which ingenious device they were said to have been the first inventors  it is my chief intent at present to record the great exploits of that branch of the family who have made themselves remarkable in england though they began to signalize themselves very early and are still very flourishing in most parts of the world many of them were egyptian priests four thousand years ago and told the people that it was religion to worship dogs monkeys and green leeks and their descendants prevailed on the greeks and romans to build temples in honor of supposed deities who were in their own estimation of them whores and whoremongers pickpockets and drunkards others rose up some ages after in turkey and persuaded the people to embrace the doctrine of bloodshed and the sword in the name of the most merciful god and others have manifested their lineal descent from nonsense and impudence by affirming that there is no god at all there were also among them many shrewd philosophers some of whom though they were racked with a fit of the stone or laid up with a gouty toe declared that they felt not the least degree of pain and others would not trust their own eyes but when they saw an horse or a dog could not tell whether it was not a chair or a table and even made a doubt of their own existence  we have no certain account of the progress of nonsense here in england till after the reformation all we hear of her and her progeny before that period of time is that they led a lazy life among the monks in cloisters and convents dreaming over old legends of saints drawing up breviaries and massbooks and stringing together some barbarous latin verses in rhyme in the days of queen elizabeth so little encouragement was given to her family that it seemed to have been almost extinct but in the succeeding reign it flourished again and filled the most considerable offices in the nation nonsense became a great favorite at court where she was highly caressed on account of her wit which consisted in puns and quibbles and the bonny monarch himself was thought to take a more than ordinary delight in her conversation at this time many of her progeny took orders and got themselves preferred to the best livings by turning the evangelists into punsters and making st paul quibble from the pulpit among the rest there was a bishop a favorite son of nonsense of whom it is particularly recorded that he used to tickle his courtly audience by telling them that matrimony was become a matter of money with many other right reverend jests recorded in joe miller several brothers of this family were likewise bred to the bar and very gravely harangued against old women sucked by devils in the shape of ramcats etc as an instance of their profound wisdom and sagacity i need only mention that just and truly pious act of parliament made against the crying sin of witchcraft   jac i chap    such as shall use invocation or conjuration of any evil spirit or shall consult covenant with entertain employ feed or reward any evil spirit to any intent or take up any dead person or part thereof to be used in witchcraft or have used any of the said arts whereby any person shall be killed consumed or lamed in his or her body they together with their accessories before the fact shall suffer as felons without benefit of clergy  in the troublesome times of king charles the first nonsense and her family sided with the parliament these set up new sects in religion some of them cropped their hair short and called themselves the enlightened some fell into trances and pretended to see holy visions while others got into tubs and held forth with many whinings and groans and snuffling through the nose in the merry days of king charles the second nonsense assumed a more gay and libertine air and her progeny from fanatics became downright infidels several courtiers of the family wrote lewd plays as well as luscious lovesongs and other loose verses which were collected together and greedily bought up in miscellanies in the succeeding reign some of the kindred who had received their education at st omers thought themselves on the point of establishing nonsense in church and state and were preparing to make bonfires on the occasion in smithfield when they were obliged to leave the kingdom  since the revolution the field of politics has afforded large scope for nonsense and her family to make themselves remarkable hence arose the various sects in party distinguished by the names of whig and tory ministerial and jacobite sunderlandians oxfordians godolphinians bolingbrokians walpolians pelhamians etc etc etc names which have kindled as hot a war in pamphlets and journals as the guelphs and gibilines in italy or the big and littleendians in the kingdom of lilliput  i have here endeavored to give a short abridgement of the history of nonsense though a very small part of the exploits of the family can be included in so compendious a chronicle some of them were very deep scholars and filled the professors chairs at the universities they composed many elaborate dissertations to convince the world that two and two make four and discovered by dint of syllogism that white is not black their enquiries in natural philosophy were no less extraordinary many spent their lives and their fortunes in attempting to discover a wonderful stone that should turn every baser metal into gold and others employed themselves in making artificial wings by the help of which they should fly up into the world of the moon another branch of the family took to the belles lettres and were the original founders of the learned society of grubstreet  never was any era in the annals of nonsense more illustrious than the present nor did that noble family ever more signally distinguish itself in every occupation in oratory who are greater proficients than the progeny of nonsense witness many long and eloquent speeches delivered in st stephens chapel in westminster hall at assizes and quarter sessions at claremarket and the robinhood  in philosophy what mavelous things have not been proved by nonsense the sometime professor of astronomy at gresham college showed sir isaac newton to be a mere ass and wiredrawed the books of moses into a complete system of natural philosophy lifeguardmen have with the utmost certainty of nonsense foretold earthquakes and others have penned curious essays on airquakes waterquakes and comets  in politics how successfully have the sons of nonsense bandied about the terms of court and country how wisely have they debated upon taxes and with what amazing penetration did they but lately foresee an invasion  in religion their domain is particularly extensive for though nonsense is excluded at least from the first part of the service in all regular churches yet she often occupies the whole ceremony at the tabernacle and foundery in moorfields and the chapel in longacre but for the credit of so polite an age be it known that the children of nonsense who are many of them people of fashion are as often seen at the playhouse as at church and it is something strange that the family of nonsense is now divided against itself and in high contest about the management of their favorite amusement  the opera  the connoisseur by mr town critic and censorgeneral number cxix thursday may        plenus rimarum sum huc et illuc perfluo ter there is no mark of our confidence taken more kindly by a friend than the intrusting him with a secret nor any which he is so likely to abuse confidantes in general are like crazy firelocks which are no sooner charged and cocked than the spring gives way and the report immediately follows happy to have been thought worthy the confidence of one friend they are impatient to manifest their importance to another till between them and their friend and their friends friend the whole matter is presently known to all our friends round the wrekin the secret catches as it were by contact and like electrical matter breaks forth from every link in the chain almost at the same instant thus the whole exchange may be thrown into a buz to morrow by what was whispered in the middle of marlborough downs this morning and in a weeks time the streets may ring with the intrigue of a woman of fashion bellowed out from the foul mouths of the hawkers though at present it is known to no creature living but her gallant and her waitingmaid  as the talent of secrecy is of so great importance to society and the necessary commerce between individuals cannot be securely carried on without it that this deplorable weakness should be so general is much to be lamented you may as well pour water into a funnel or a sieve and expect it to be retained there as commit any of your concerns to so slippery a companion it is remarkable that in those men who have thus lost the faculty of retention the desire of being communicative is always most prevalent where it is least to be justified if they are entrusted with a matter of no great moment affairs of more consequence will perhaps in a few hours shuffle it entirely out of their thoughts but if any thing be delivered to them with an air of earnestness a low voice and the gesture of a man in terror for the consequence of it is being known if the door is bolted and every precaution taken to prevent a surprise however they may promise secrecy and however they may intend it the weight upon their minds will be so extremely oppressive that it will certainly put their tongues in motion  this breach of trust so universal amongst us is perhaps in great measure owing to our education the first lesson our little masters and misses are taught is to become blabs and telltales they are bribed to divulge the petty intrigues of the family below stairs to pappa and mamma in the parlour and a doll or a hobbyhorse is generally the encouragement of a propensity which could scarcely be attoned for by a whipping as soon as children can lisp out the little intelligence they have picked up in the hall or the kitchen they are admired for their wit if the butler has been caught kissing the housekeeper in his pantry or the footman detected in romping with the chambermaid away flies little tommy or betsy with the news the parents are lost in admiration of the pretty rogues understanding and reward such uncommon ingenuity with a kiss and a sugarplumb  nor does an inclination to secrecy meet with less encouragement at school the governantes at the boardingschool teach miss to be a good girl and tell them every thing she knows thus if any young lady is unfortunately discovered eating a green apple in a corner if she is heard to pronounce a naughty word or is caught picking the letters out of another misss sampler away runs the chit who is so happy as to get the start of the rest screams out her information as she goes and the prudent matron chucks her under the chin and tells her that she is a good girl and every body will love her  the management of our young gentlemen is equally absurd in most of our schools if a lad is discovered in a scrape the impeachment of an accomplice as at the old bailey is made the condition of a pardon i remember a boy engaged in robbing an orchard who was unfortunately taken prisoner in an apple tree and conducted under a strong guard of the farmer and his dairymaid to the masters house upon his absolute refusal to discover his associates the pedagogue undertook to lash him out of his fidelity but finding it impossible to scourge the secret out of him he at last gave him up for an obstinate villain and sent him to his father who told him he was ruined and was going to disinherit him for not betraying his schoolfellows i must own i am not fond of thus drubbing our youth into treachery and am much more pleased with the request of ulysses when he went to troy who begged of those who were to have the charge of telemachus that they would above all things teach him to be just sincere faithful and to keep a secret  every mans experience must have furnished him with instances of confidantes who are not to be relied on and friends who are not to be trusted but few perhaps have thought it a character so well worth their attention as to have marked out the different degrees into which it may be divided and the different methods by which secrets are communicated  ned trusty is a telltale of a very singular kind having some sense of his duty he hesitates a little at the breach of it if he engages never to utter a syllable he most punctually performs his promise but then he has the knack of insinuating by a nod and a shrug welltimed or a seasonable leer as much as others can convey in express terms it is difficult in short to determine whether he is more to be admired for his resolution in not mentioning or his ingenuity in disclosing a secret he is also excellent at a doubtful phrase as hamlet calls it or an ambiguous giving out and his conversation consists chiefly of such broken innuendos as well i know  or i could  an if i would  or if i list to speak  or there be an if there might etc here he generally stops and leaves it to his hearers to draw proper inferences from these piecemeal premises with due encouragement however he may be prevailed on to slip the padlock from his lips and immediately overwhelms you with a torrent of secret history which rushes forth with more violence for having been so long confined  poor meanwell though he never fails to transgress is rather to be pitied than condemned to trust him with a secret is to spoil his appetite to break his rest and to deprive him for a time of every earthly enjoyment like a man who travels with his whole fortune in his pocket he is terrified if you approach him and immediately suspects that you come with a felonious intent to rob him of his charge if he ventures abroad it is to walk in some unfrequented place where he is least in danger of an attack at home he shuts himself up from his family paces it to and fro in his chamber and has no relief but from muttering over to himself what he longs to publish to the world and would gladly submit to the office of town crier for the liberty of proclaiming it in the market place at length however weary of his burden and resolved to bear it no longer he consigns it to the custody of the first friend he meets and returns to his wife with a cheerful aspect and wonderfully altered for the better  careless is perhaps equally undesigning though not equally excusable entrust him with an affair of the utmost importance on the concealment of which your fortune and happiness depend he hears you with a kind of halfattention whistles a favorite air and accompanies it with the drumming of his fingers upon the table as soon as your narration is ended or perhaps in the middle of it he asks your opinion of his swordknot damns his tailor for having dressed him in a snuffcolourd coat instead of a pompadour and leaves you in haste to attend an auction where as if he meant to dispose of his intelligence to the best bidder he divulges it with a voice as loud as the auctioneers and when you tax him with having played you false he is heartily sorry for it but never knew that it was to be a secret  to these i might add the character of the open and unreserved who thinks it a breach of friendship to conceal any thing from his intimates and the impertinent who having by dint of observation made himself master of your secret imagines he may lawfully publish the knowledge it has cost him so much labor to obtain and considers that privilege as the reward due to his industry but i shall leave these with many other characters which my readers own experience may suggest to him and conclude with prescribing as a short remedy for this evil  that no man may betray the counsel of his friend let every man keep his own  the connoisseur by mr town critic and censorgeneral number cxx thursday may         judicium subtle videndis artibus hor taste is at present the darling idol of the polite world and the world of letters and indeed seems to be considered as the quintessence of almost all the arts and sciences the fine ladies and gentlemen dress with taste the architects whether gothic or chinese build with taste the painters paint with taste the poets write with taste critics read with taste and in short fiddlers players singers dancers and mechanics themselves are all the sons and daughters of taste yet in this amazing superabundancy of taste few can say what it really is or what the word itself signifies should i attempt to define it in the style of a connoisseur i must run over the names of all the famous poets painters and sculptors ancient and modern and after having pompously harangued on the excellencies of apelles phidias praxiteles angela rubens poussin and dominichino with a word or two on all tasteful compositions such as those of homer virgil tasso dante and ariosto i should leave the reader in wonder of my profound erudition and as little informed as before but as deep learning though more flaming and pompous is perhaps not always so useful as common sense i shall endeavor to get at the true meaning of the word taste by considering what it usually imports in familiar writings and ordinary conversation  it is supposed by lock and other close reasoners that words are intended as signs of our ideas but daily experience will convince us that words are often used to express no ideas at all thus many persons who talk perpetually of taste throw it out as a mere expletive without any meaning annexed to it bardolph when demanded the meaning of the word accommodated wisely explains it by saying that  accommodated sir is  a  a  a  accommodated sir is as if one should say  a  accommodated and if in like manner you ask one of these people what is taste they will tell you that taste is a kind of a sort of a  a  a  in short taste is taste these talkers must be considered as absolute blanks in conversation since it is impossible to learn the explanation of a term from them as they affix no determinate meaning to any expression  among men of sense whose words carry meaning in their sound taste is commonly used in one of these two significations first when they give any person the appellation of a man of taste they would intimate that he has a turn for the polite arts as well as the lesser elegancies of life and that from his natural bent to those studies and his acquired knowledge in them he is capable of distinguishing what is good or bad in any thing of that kind submitted to his judgment the meaning at other times implied by a man of taste is that he is not only so far an adept in those matters as to be able to judge of them accurately but is also possessed of the faculty of executing them gracefully these two significations will perhaps be more easily conceived and clearly illustrated when applied to our sensual taste the man of taste according to the first may be considered as a bon vivant who is fond of the dishes before him and distinguishes nicely what is savoury and delicious or flat and insipid in the ingredients of each according to the second he may be regarded as the cook who from knowing what things will mix well together and distinguishing by a nice taste when he has arrived at that happy mixture is able to compose such exquisite dishes  both these significations of the word will be found agreeable to the following definition of it which i have somewhere seen and is the only just description of the term that i ever remember to have met with taste consists in a nice harmony between the fancy and the judgment the most chastised judgment without genius can never constitute a man of taste and the most luxuriant imagination unregulated by judgment will only carry us into wild and extravagant deviations from it to mix oil vinegar butter milk eggs etc incoherently together would make an olio not to be relished by any palate and the man who has no gout for delicacies himself will never compose a good dish though he should ever so strictly adhere to the rules of la chapelle hannah glass and martha bradley i confine myself at present chiefly to that signification of the word which implies the capacity of exerting our own faculties in the several branches of taste because that always includes the other  having thus settled what taste is it may not be unentertaining to examine modern taste by these rules and perhaps it will appear that on the one hand its most pleasing flights and ravishing elegancies are extravagant and absurd and that on the other hand those who affect a correct taste in all their undertakings proceed mechanically without genius the first species of taste which gives a loose to the imagination indulges itself in caprice and is perpetually striking new strokes is the chief regulator of the fashion in dress it has put huntingpoles into the hands of our gentlemen and erected coaches and windmills on the heads of our ladies in equipage it has built chariots of papier mache and by putting spotted danish horses into the harness has made our beaux look like bacchus in his car drawn by leopards the ornaments both on the outside and inside of our houses are all gothic or chinese and whoever makes a pagod of his parlour throws a plank or two with an irregular crossbarred paling over a dirty ditch or places battlements on a roothouse or a stable fits up his house and garden entirely in taste  the second sort of men of taste are to be found chiefly among the literati and are those who despising the modern whims to which fashion has given the name of taste pretend to follow with the most scrupulous exactness the chaste models of the ancients these are the poets who favor us with correct epithetical and tasteful compositions whose works are without blemish and conformable to the precise rules of quintilian horace and aristotle and as they are intended merely for the perusal of persons of the most refined taste it is no wonder that they are above the level of common understandings these too are the critics who in their comments upon authors embarrass us with repeated allusions to the study of virtu and these too are the connoisseurs in architecture who build ruins after vitruvius and necessaries according to palladio one gentleman of this cast has built his villa upon a bleak hill with four spacious porticos open on each side to court the four winds because in the sultry regions of italy this model has been thought most convenient and another has in great measure shut out the light from his apartments and cut off all prospect from his windows by erecting an high wall before his house which in italy has been judged necessary to screen them from the sun  architecture seems indeed to be the main article in which the efforts of taste are now displayed among those who are fond of exerting their fancies in capricious innovations i might instance the many pretty whims of which an infinite variety may be seen within ten miles of london but us a proof of the noble and judicious taste among us i shall beg leave to describe in the style of a connoisseur a most amazing curiosity erected in a very polite quarter of this town  in the midst of a noble and spacious area stands a grand obelisk the base forms a perfect square with right angles the body of it is cylindrical but the capital is an heptagon and has several curious lines and figures described on each of its seven flat sides or superfices which serve to terminate as many most magnificent and striking vistas this superb column no less remarkable than the famous pillar of trajan seems from the several gnomons and other hieroglyphics stuck about it to have been originally dedicated to the sun but is now known among the vulgar by the more common name of the seven dials  this day is published in two neat pocket volumes price six shillings bound  with a new translation of the mottos and quotations  the

let the reader so far into my secrets as to inform him whether i am married or single it may not be amiss to acquaint him that supposing i still remain a bachelor it has not been the fault of my friends or relations on the contrary as soon as i was what they call settled in the world they were so assiduous in looking out for a wife for me that nothing was required on my part but immediately to fall in love with the lady they had pitched upon and could i have complied with their several choices i should have been married at the same time to a tall and a short a plump and a slender a young and an old woman one with a great deal of money and another with none at all each of whom were separately recommended by them as the properest person in the world for me  i know not how it happens but it is notorious that most people take a pleasure in making matches either thinking matrimony a state of bliss into which they would charitably call all their friends and acquaintance or perhaps struggling in the toils they are desirous of catching others in the net that ensnared them many matches have been brought about between two persons absolute strangers to each other through this kind mediation of our friends who are always ready to take upon them the office of an honorable gobetween some have come together merely from having been talked of by their acquaintance as likely to make a match and i have known a couple who have met by accident at an horserace or danced together at an assembly that in less than a fortnight have been driven into matrimony in their own defense by having been first paired in private conversations and afterward in the common newspapers  as we cannot insure happiness to our friends at the same time that we help them to husbands or wives one would imagine that few would care to run the hazard of bestowing misery where they meant a kindness i know a goodnatured lady who has officiously brought upon herself the ill will and the curses of many of her dearest and most intimate friends on this very account she has a sister for whom she provided a most excellent husband who has shown his affection for her by spending her whole fortune upon his mistresses she contrived that another near relation should snap up a rich widow who was arrested for her debts within a week after marriage and it cost her a whole twelvemonth to bring two doting lovers of her acquaintance together who parted beds before the honeymoon was expired  but if our friends will thus condescend to be matchmakers from a spirit of benevolence and for our own advantage only there are others who have taken up the profession from less disinterested motives who bring beauty and fortune to market and traffic in all the accomplishments that can make the marriage state happy these traders dispose of all sorts of rich heirs and heiresses baronets lords ladies of fashion and daughters of country squires with as much coolness as drovers sell bullocks they keep complete registers of the condition and qualifications of all the marriageable persons within the kingdom and it is as common to apply to them for an husband or wife as to the registeroffices for a man or maidservant they may indeed be considered as fathers and guardians for the greatest part of our youth of both sexes since in marriage they may be most properly said to give them away  it is something comical to consider the various persons to whom men of this profession are useful we may naturally suppose that a young fellow who has no estate but what like tinsels in the drummer is merely personal would be glad to come down handsomely after consummation with a woman of fortune and a smart girl who has more charms than wealth would give round poundage on being taken for better for worse by a rich heir many a tradesman also wants a wife to manage his family while he looks after the shop and thinks it better to recommend himself by this convenient friend than by means of the daily advertiser there are also several young people who are indifferent as to any person in particular and have no passion for the state itself yet want to be married because it will deliver them from the restraint of parents but the most unnatural though very common applications of this sort are from the rich and the noble who having immense estates to bestow on their children will make use of the meanest instruments to couple them to another of the same overgrown fortune  i have known many droll accidents happen from the mistakes of these mercenary matchmakers and remember one in particular which i shall here set down for the entertainment of my readers a careful old gentleman came up from the north on purpose to marry his son and was recommended by one of these couplers to a twenty thousand pounder he accordingly put on his best wig best beaver and goldbuttoned coat and went to pay his respects to the ladys mamma he told her that he had not the pleasure of being known to her but as his sons quiet depended on it he had taken the liberty of waiting on her in short he at length broke the matter to her and informed her that his boy had seen her daughter at church and was violently in love with her concluding that he would do very handsomely for the lad and would make it worth her while to have him the old lady thanked him for the honor he intended her family but she supposed to be sure as he appeared to be a prudent and sensible gentletleman he would expect a fortune answerable say nothing of that madam say nothing of that interrupted the don  i have heard  but if it was less it should not break any squares between us  pray sir how much does the world say replied the lady  why madam i suppose she has not less than twenty thousand pounds    not so much sir said the old lady very gravely  well madam i suppose then it may be nineteen or  or  only eighteen thousand pounds   not so much sir  well well perhaps not but  if it was only seventeen thousand  no sir  or sixteen  no  or we must make allowances perhaps but fifteen thousand   not so much sir  here ensued a profound silence for near a minute when the old gentleman rubbing his forehead  well madam we must come to some conclusion  pray is it less than fourteen thousand how much more is it than twelve thousand  less sir   less madam   less  but is it more than ten thousand   not so much sir  not so much madam   not so much  why if it is lodged in the funds consider madam interest is low very low  but as the boy loves her trifles shall not part us has she got eight thousand pounds   not so much sir  why then madam perhaps the young ladys fortune may not be above six  or five thousand pounds  nothing like it sir  at these words the old gentleman started from his chair and running out of

mentioned in a former paper that a friend of mine was writing a new treatise on ethics or a system of immoral philosophy compiled from the principles and practice of the present age in which the extraordinary modesty of the moderns would be enlarged on which has induced them to comprehend all the vices instead of virtues in their idea of a fine gentleman the work is now finished and the author has sent me the following letter concerning the dedication with leave to submit it to the public  dear town the flatness and fulsom insipidity of dedications has often been the subject of our conversation and we have always agreed that authors have miscarried in these pieces of flattery by injudiciously affronting when they meant to compliment their patrons the humble dedicator loads his great man with virtues totally foreign to his nature and disposition which sit as aukwardly upon him as lace or embroidery on a chimneysweeper and so overwhelms him with the huge mass of learning with which he graciously dubs him a scholar that he makes as ridiculous a figure as the ass in the dunciad after having thus bepraised his patron till the new maecenas is heartily ashamed of himself he wonders that no notice is taken of so pompous an eulogium and that a dedication should be as mere a drug as a sermon  lory in the relapse advises fashion to get into the good graces of lord foppington by falling in love with his coat being in raptures with his peruke ravished with the genteel dangle of his swordknot and in short to recommend himself to his noble elder brother by seeming to be captivated with his favorites in like manner the author who would make his dedication really valuable should not talk to his patron of his honor and virtue and integrity and a pack of unfashionable qualities which only serve to disgrace a fine gentleman but boldly paint him what he really is and at the same time convince him of his merit in being a fool and his glory in being a scoundrel this mode of dedication though proper at all times will appear with a particular good grace before a system of immoral philosophy wherefore as my book is now finished i have here sent you a rough draught of the epistle dedicatory and shall be glad to hear your opinion of it  may it please your grace or my lord or sir you are in every point so complete a fine gentleman that the following treatise is but a faint transcript of your accomplishments there is not one qualification requisite in the character of a man of spirit which you do not possess give me leave therefore on the present occasion to point forth your inestimable qualities to the world and hold up to the public view so glorious an example  you distinguished yourself so early in life and exalted yourself so far above the common pitch of vulgar bucks that you was distinguished before the age of twenty with the noble appellation of stag and when i consider the many gallant exploits you have performed the number of rascally poltroons you have sent out of the world the number of pretty little foundlings you have brought into it how many girls you have debauched how many women of quality you have intrigued with and how many hogsheads of french wine have run through your body i cannot help contemplating you as a stag of the first head  what great reason have you to value yourself on your noble achievements at arthurs the sums you formerly lost and those you have lately won are amazing instances of your spirit and address first in venturing so deeply before you was let into the secret and then in managing it with so much adroitness and dexterity since you have been acquainted with it nobody cogs the dice or packs the cards half so skilfully you hedge a bet with uncommon nicety and are a most incomparably shrewd judge of the odds  nor have your exploits on the turf rendered you less famous let the annals of pond and heber deliver down to posterity the glorious account of what plates you have won what matches you made and how often the knowing ones have been taken in when for private reasons you have found it necessary that your horse should run on the wrong side of the post or be distanced after winning the first heat i need not mention your own skill in horsemanship and in how many matches you have condescended to ride yourself for in this particular it must be acknowledged that you cannot be outdone even by your groom or jockey  all the world will witness the many instances of your courage which has been often tried and exerted in hydepark and behind montaguehouse nay you have sometimes been known to draw your sword most heroicly at the opera the play and even at private routes and assemblies how often have you put to flight a whole army of watchmen constables and beadles with the justices at their head you have cleared a whole bawdy house before you and taken many a tavern by storm you have pinned a waiter to the ground and have besides proved yourself an excellent marksman by shooting a postboy flying with so much valor and firmness it is not to be doubted but that you would behave with the same intrepidity if occasions called upon hounslowheath or in maidenheadthicket and if it were necessary you would as boldly resign yourself up to the hands of jack ketch and swing as genteely as maclean or gentleman harry the same noble spirit would likewise enable you to aim the pistol at your own head and go out of the world like a man of honor and a gentleman  but your courage has not rendered you insusceptible of the softer passions for which your heart has been ever inclined to say nothing of your gallantries with women of fashion your intrigues with milliners and mantuamakers or your seducing of raw country girls and innocent tradesmens daughters you have formerly been so constant in your devoirs to mrs douglass and the whole sisterhood that you sacrificed your health and constitution in their service but above all witness that sweet delicate creature whom you have now in keeping and for whom you entertain such a strong and faithful passion that for her sake you have tenderly and affectionately deserted your wife and family  though from your elegant taste for pleasures you appear made for the gay world yet these polite amusements have not called off your attention from the more serious studies of politics and religion in politics you have made such a wonderful proficiency both in theory and practice that you have discovered the good of your country to be a mere joke and confirmed your own interest as well as established your consequence in the proper place by securing half a dozen boroughs as to religion you soon unravelled every mystery of that and not only know the bible to be as romantic as the alcoran but have also written several volumes to make your discoveries plain to meaner capacities the ridiculous prejudices of a foolish world unhappily prevent your publishing them at present but you have wisely provided that they shall one day see the light when i doubt not they will be deemed invaluable and be as universally admired as the posthumous works of lord bolingbroke  i am may it please your

foundling hospital will be open for the reception of all infants in general under a certain age have i find given universal satisfaction the consequences of a big belly do not appear so dreadful as heretofore and it was but yesterday that a young fellow of intrigue told me he was happy that his children would no longer be thrown out of the hospital as he himself was out of arthurs by black balls for my part though i have no lady in keeping no child by my housekeeper nor any other affair of gallantry on my hands which makes me wish to swell the number of infants maintained by that charity i must own myself to be exceedingly rejoiced at the extension of so benevolent a design i look upon it as the certain preservation of many hundreds in embryo nor shall we now hear of so many helpless babes birthstrangled in a necessary or smothered by the ditchdelivered drab as a bastard is accounted in law quasi nullius filius the child of nobody and related to nobody and yet is blessed with as fair proportions and capable of an equal degree of perfection with honest madams issue it is surely an act of great humanity thus to rescue them from untimely deaths and other miseries which they do not merit whatever may be the guilt of their parents  though it is obvious that this hospital will be made the receptacle of many legitimate children it is no less certain that the rich as well as the poor will often send their baseborn bantlings to this general nursery the wealthy man of quality or substantial cit may have their private familyreasons for not owning the fruits of their secret amors and be glad to put the little living witness of their intrigues out of the way for this reason an history of the foundlings received there would be very curious and entertaining as it would contain many anecdotes not to be learned from any parish register the reflections that passed in my mind on this subject gave occasion the other evening to the following dream  methought as i was standing at the private door of the hospital where a crowd of females each of them with a child in her arms were pressing to get in an elderly gentleman whom from his white staff i took to be a governor of the charity very courteously invited me to come in i accepted his offer and having seated myself next him  mr town says he i am conscious that you look upon most these little infants as the offsprings of so many unmarried fathers and maidenmothers which have been clandestinely smuggled into the world know then that i am one of those guardian genii appointed to superintend the fortunes of bastards therefore as this hospital is more immediately under my tuition i have put on this disguise and if you please will let you into the secret history of those babes who are my wards and their parents  i assured him his intelligence would be highly agreeable and several now coming up to offer their children he resumed his discourse  observe said he that jolly little rogue with plump cheeks a florid complexion blue eyes and sandy locks we have here already several of his brethren by the mothers side some fair some brown and some black and yet they are all supposed to have come by the same father the mother has for many years been housekeeper to a gentleman who cannot see that her children bear the marks of his own servants and that this very brat is the exact resemblance of his coachman  that puling whining infant there with a pale face emaciated body and distorted limbs is the forced product of viperbroth and cantharides it is the offspring of a wornout buck of quality who at the same time he debauched the mother ruined her constitution by a filthy disease in consequence of which she with much difficulty brought forth this just picture of himself in miniature  the next that offers is the issue of a careful cit who as he keeps an horse for his own riding on sundays which he lets out all the rest of the week keeps also a mistress for his recreation on the seventh day who lets herself out on all the other six that other babe owes his birth likewise to the city but is the joint product as we may say of two fathers who being great oeconomists in their pleasures as well as in their business have set up a whore and an one horsechaise in partnership together  that pert young baggage there who so boldly presses forward with her brat is not the mother of it but is maid to a single lady of the strictest honor and unblemished reputation about a twelve month ago her mistress went to bath for the benefit of her health and ten months after she traveled into north wales to see a relation from whence she is just returned we may suppose that she took a fancy to that pretty babe while in the country and brought it up to town with her in order to place it here as she did a few years ago to another charming boy which being too old to be got into this hospital is now at a school in yorkshire where young gentlemen are boarded clothed and educated and found in all necessaries for ten pounds a year  that chubby little boy which you see in the arms of yonder strapping wench in a camblet gown and red cloak is her own son she is by profession a bedmaker in one of the universities and of the same college in which the father a grave tutor holds a fellowship under the usual condition of not marrying many sober gentlemen of the cloth who are in the same scrape are glad to take the benefit of this charity and if all of the same reverend order like the priests abroad were laid under the same restrictions you might expect to see a particular hospital erected for the reception of the sons of the clergy  that next child belongs to a seacaptains lady whose husband is expected to return every moment from a long voyage the fears of which have happily hastened the birth of this infant a full month before its time that other is the posthumous child of a wealthy old gentleman who had married a young girl for love and dyed in the honeymoon this his son and heir was not born till near a twelve month after his decease because its birth was retarded by the excessive grief of his widow who on that account rather chose to lyein privately and to lodge their only child here than to have its legitimacy and her own honor called in question by her husbands relations  my companion pointed out to me several others no less extraordinary among which i remember he told me one was the unhallowed brood of a methodist teacher and another the premature spawn of a maid of honor a poor author eased himself of a very heavy load of two twindaughters which in an evil hour he begot on an hawker of pamphlets after he had been writing a luscious novel but i could not help smiling at the marks sent in with these new muses signifying that one had been christened terpsichore and the other polyhymnia several bantlings were imported from islington hoxton and other villages within the sound of bow bell many were transplanted hither out of the country and a whole litter of brats were sent in from two or three parishes in particular for which it is doubtful whether they were most indebted to the parson or the squire  a modestlooking woman now brought a very fine babe to be admitted but the governors rejected it as it appeared to be above two months old the mother on the contrary persisted in affirming that it was but just born and addressing herself to me desired me to look at it i accordingly took it in my arms and while i was tossing it up and down and praising its beauty the sly hussy contrived to slip away leaving the precious charge to my care the efforts which i made to bawl after her and the squalling of the brat which rung piteously in my ears luckily awaked me and i was very happy to find that i had only been dandling my pillow instead

placent non sum desultor amoris tu mihi si qua fides cura perennis eris ovid almost every man is or has been or at least thinks that he is or has been a lover one has fought for his mistress another has drank for her another wrote for her and another has done all three and yet perhaps in spite of their duels poetry and bumpers not one of them ever entertained a sincere passion i have lately taken a survey of the numerous tribe of enamoratos and after having observed the various shapes they wear think i may safely pronounce that though all profess to have been in love there are very few who are really capable of it  it is a maxim of rochefoucaults that many men would never have been in love if they had never heard of love the justice of this remark is equal to its shrewdness the ridiculous prate of a family has frequently great influence on young minds who learn to love as they do every thing else by imitation young creatures almost mere children have been consumed with this secondhand flame lighted up at anothers passion and in consequence of the loves of the footman and chambermaid i have known little master fancy himself a dying swain at the age of thirteen and little miss pining away with love in a bib and hanging sleeves  that vast heap of volumes filled with love and sufficient in number to make a library are great inflamers and seldom fail to produce that kind of passion described by rochefoucault the chief of these literary seducers are the old romances and their degenerate spawn the modern novels the young student reads of the emotions of love till he imagines that he feels them throbbing and fluttering in his little breast as valetudinarians study the history of a disease till they fancy themselves affected with every symptom of it for this reason i am always sorry to see any of this trash in the hands of young people i look upon cassandra and cleopatra as well as betty barnes polly willis etc as no better than bawds and consider don bellianis of greece and sir amadis de gaul with george edwards loveill etc as arrant pimps but though romances and novels are both equally stimulatives yet their operations are very different the romancestudent becomes a fond corydon of sicily or a very damon of arcadia and is in good truth such a dying swain that he believes he shall hang himself on the next willow or drown himself in the next pond if he should lose the object of his wishes but the young novelist turns out more a man of the world and after having gained the affections of his mistress forms a hundred schemes to secure the possession of her and to bam her relations  there are among the tribe of lovers a sort of lukewarm gentlemen who can hardly be said in the language of love to entertain a flame for their mistress these are your men of superlative delicacy and refinement who loath the gross ideas annexed to the amors of the vulgar and aim at something more spiritualized and sublime these philosophers in love dote on the mind alone of their mistress and would fain see her naked soul diverted of its material encumbrances gentlemen of this complexion might perhaps not improperly be ranged in the romantic class but they have assumed to themselves the name of platonic lovers  platonism however is in these days very scarce and there is another class infinitely more numerous composed of a sort of lovers whom we may justly distinguish by the title of epicureans the principles of this sect are diametrically opposite to those of the platonics they think no more of the soul of their mistress than a mussulman but are in raptures with her person a lover of this sort is in perpetual ecstasies his passion is so violent that he even scorches you with his flame and he runs over the perfections of his mistress in the same style that a jockey praises his horse such limbs such eyes such a neck and breast such  oh she is a rare piece their ideas go no farther than mere external accomplishments and as their wounds may be said to be only skin deep we cannot allow their breasts to be smitten with love though perhaps they may rankle with a much grosser passion yet it must be owned that nothing is more common than for gentlemen of this cast to be involved in what is called a lovematch but then it is owing to the same cause with the marriage of sir john brute who says i married my wife because i wanted to lie with her and she would not let me  other gentlemen of a gay disposition and warm constitution who go in the catalogue for lovers are adorers of almost every woman they see the flame of love is as easily kindled in them as the sparks are struck out of a flint and it also expires as soon a lover of this sort dances one day with a lady at a ball and loses his heart to her in a minuet the next another carries it off in the mall and the next day perhaps he goes out of town and lodges it in the possession of all the country beauties successively till at last he brings it back to town with him and presents it to the first woman he meets this class is very numerous but ought by no means to hold a place among the tribe of true lovers since a gentleman who is thus in love with every body may fairly be said not to be in love at all  love is universally allowed to be whimsical and if whim is the essence of love none can be accounted truer lovers than those who admire their mistress for some particular charm which enchains them though it would singly never captivate any body else some gentlemen have been won to conjugal embraces by a pair of fine arms others have been held fast by an even white set of teeth and i know a very good scholar who was ensnared by a set of golden tresses because it was the taste of the ancients and the true classical hair those ladies whose lovers are such piecemeal admirers are in perpetual danger of losing them a rash or a pimple may abate their affection all those the object of whose adoration is merely a pretty face or a fine person are in the power of the like accidents and the small pox has occasioned many a poor lady the loss of her beauty and her lover at the same time  but after all these spurious enamoratos there are some few whose passion is sincere and wellfounded true genuine love is always built upon esteem not that i would mean that a man can reason and argue himself into love but that a constant intercourse with an amiable woman will lead him into a contemplation of her excellent qualities which will insensibly win his heart before he is himself aware of it and beget all those hopes fears and other extravagances which are the natural attendants on a true passion love has been described ten thousand times but that i may be sure that the little picture i would draw of it is taken from nature i will conclude this paper with the story of honest will easy and his amiable wife will easy and miss  became very early acquainted and from being familiarly intimate with the whole family will might be almost said to live there he dined and supped with them perpetually in town and spent great part of the summer with them at their seat in the country will and the lady were both universally allowed to have sense and their frequent conversations together gave them undoubted proofs of the goodness of each others disposition they delighted in the company and admired the perfections of each other and gave a thousand little indications of a growing passion not unobserved by others even while it was yet unknown and unsuspected even by themselves however after some time will by mutual agreement demanded the lady of her father in marriage but alas the course of true love never yet run smooth the illjudged ambition of a parent induced the father out of mere love to his daughter to refuse her hand to the only man in the world with whom she could live happily because he imagined that he might in the smithfield phrase do better for her but love grounded on just principles is not easily shaken and as it appeared that their mutual passion had taken too deep root ever to be extirpated the father at last reluctantly halfconsented to their union they enjoy a genteel competency and will by his integrity and abilities is an honor to a learned profession and a blessing to his wife whose greatest praise is that her virtues deserve such an husband she is pleased with having left dross to duchesses he considers her happiness as his main interest and their example every day gives fresh conviction to the father that where two persons of strong sense and good hearts conceive a reciprocal affection for each other their passion is genuine and lasting and their union is perhaps the truest state of happiness under the sun  the connoisseur by mr town critic and censorgeneral number cxxv thursday june

very well received here but more especially that part of it which contained the modern definition of the word ruined you must know sir that in the language of our old dons every young man is ruined who is not an arrant tycho brahe or erra pater yet it is remarkable that though the servants of the muses meet with more than ordinary discouragement at this place yet cambridge has produced many celebrated poets witness spenser milton cowley dryden etc not to mention some admired writers of the present times i myself sir am grievously suspected of being better acquainted with homer and virgil than euclid or sanderson and am universally agreed to be ruined for having concerned myself with hexameter and pentameter more than diameter the equity of this decision i shall not dispute but content myself at present with submitting to the public by means of your paper the following lines on the import of another favorite word occasioned by the essay above mentioned  words are so wollaston defines of our ideas merely signs which have a power at will to vary as being vague and arbitrary now damned for instance  all agree damnds the superlative degree means that alone and nothing more however taken heretofore damned is a word cannot stand alone which has no meaning of its own but signifies or bad or good just as its neighbors understood examples we may find enough damned high damned low damned fire damned stuff so fares it too with its relation i mean its substantive damnation the wit with metaphors makes bold and tells you he is damnation cold perhaps that metaphor forgot the selfsame wits damnation hot and here a fable i remember  once in the middle of december when every mead in snow was lost and every river bound with frost when families got all together and feelingly talk over the weather when  pox of the descriptive rhyme  in short it was the winter time it was a pedlars happy lot to fall into a satyrs cot shivering with cold and almost froze with pearly drop upon his nose his fingers ends all pinched to death he blew upon them with his breath friend quoth the satyr what intends that blowing on thy fingers ends it is to warm them thus i blow for they are froze as cold as snow and so inclement has it been i am like a cake of ice within come quoth the satyr comfort then i will cheer thy inside if i can youre welcome in my homely cottage to a warm fire and mess of pottage this said the satyr nothing loath a bowl prepared of savry broth which with delight the pedlar viewed as smoking on the board it stood but though the very steam arose with grateful odor to his nose one single sip he ventured not the gruel was so wondrous hot what can be done  with gentle puff he blows it till it is cool enough why how now pedlar what is the matter still at thy blowing quoth the satyr i blow to cool it cries the clown that i may get the liquor down for though i grant you have made it well you have boiled it sir as hot as hell then raising high his cloven stump the satyr smote him on the rump begone thou double knave or fool with the same breath to warm and cool friendship with such i never hold who are so damned hot and so damned cold  we

censorgeneral number cxxvi thursday june         proinde tona eloquio solitum tibi  virg i remember a rector of a parish at the court end of the town who was generally accounted a very fine preacher that used to aim at delivering himself in the most bold and animated style of oratory the tone of his voice was nicely accommodated to the different branches of his discourse and every thing was pronounced with uncommon energy and emphasis he also indulged himself in equal freedom of action and abounded in various extraordinary gesticulations his sermons themselves were sown thick with tropes metaphors and similies and every where enriched with apostrophe and prosopopaeia  as i knew that this reverend gentleman had been abroad with a young nobleman in the capacity of a traveling tutor i did not wonder at the violent exertion of his voice and the vehemence of his action as this is a piece of clerical foppery which an itinerant clergyman is apt to adopt while his pupil is gleaning all the other follies of paris at which place it is very common to see a capuchine so heated with his subject that he often seems in danger of throwing himself out of the pulpit but i was at a loss how to account for the glowing style of his discourses till happening to turn over the works of a celebrated french preacher i found that the oratorical performances of my friend were no other than faithful translations of them  this sort of pulpit plagiarism may perhaps be more adapted to the taste of some of our fashionable declaimers than the more hackneyed method of transcribing a page from barrow tillotson or atterbury but although such practices may be less liable to detection it is certainly more orthodox to rifle the works of our own divines than to ransack the treasures of romish priests and their inflamed orations are undoubtedly less adapted to the genius of our people than the sober reasonings of our own preachers it must be owned indeed that some of our clergy are greatly wanting in that life and spirit which would render their instructions more affecting as well as more pleasing their sermons are frequently drawn out in one continued drawl without any variation of voice or gesture so that it is no wonder if some of the congregation should be caught napping when the preacher himself hardly seems to be awake but though this drowsy delivery is not to be commended yet a serious earnestness is most likely to engage the attention and convince the reason this manner as it is most decent in itself is best suited to an english audience though it is no wonder that a different strain of oratory should prevail in france since a frenchman accompanies almost every word in ordinary conversation with some fantastic gesture and even enquires concerning your health and talks of the weather with a thousand shrugs and grimaces  but though i do not like to see a preacher lazily lolling on the cushion or dozing over his sermoncase and haranguing his audience with an unchristian apathy yet even this unanimated delivery is perhaps less offensive than to observe a clergyman less assiduous to instruct his audience than to be admired by them a sober divine should not ascend the pulpit with the same passions that a public orator mounts the rostrum much less should he assume the voice gesture and deportment of a player and the language of the theater he should preserve a temperance in the most earnest parts of his discourse and go through the whole of it in such a manner as best agrees with the solemn place in which it is uttered pompous nonsense bellowed out with a thundering accent comes with a worse grace from the pulpit than bombast and sustian injudiciously ranted forth by a periwigpated fellow on the stage i cannot better illustrate the absurdity and indecency of this manner than by a familiar though shameful instance of it whoever has occasionally joined with the butchers in making up the audience of the claremarket orator will agree with me that the impropriety of his style and the extravagance of his action become still more shocking and intolerable by the day which they profane and the ecclesiastical appearance of the place in which the declaimer harangues thus while those who thunder out damnation from parish pulpits may from assuming the manners of the theater be resembled to ranting players the claremarket orator while he turns religion into farce must be considered as exhibiting shows and interludes of an inferior nature and himself regarded as a jackpudding in a gown and cassock  a bloated style is perhaps of all others least to be commended it is more frequently made a shelter for nonsense than a vehicle of truth but though improper on all occasions it more especially deviates from the chaste plainness and simplicity of pulpit eloquence nor am i less displeased with those who are admired by some as pretty preachers as i think a clergyman may be a coxcomb in his style and manner as well as a prig in his appearance flowers of rhetoric injudiciously scattered over a sermon are as disgusting in his discourse as the snug wig and scented white handkerchief in his dress the pretty preacher aims also at politeness and goodbreeding takes the ladies to task in a genteel vein of raillery and handles their modish foibles with the same air that he gallants their fans but if he has a mind to put his abilities to the stretch and indulge himself in a more than ordinary flow of rhetoric he fritters away the solemnity of some scriptural subject and i have heard a flourishing declaimer of this cast take off from the awful idea of the passion by dwelling principally on the gracefulness of person sweetness of voice and elegance of deportment in the divine sufferer and at another time in speaking of the fall i have known him enter into a picturesque description of the woods groves and rivulets pansies pinks and violets that threw a perpetual gaiety over the face of nature in the garden of eden  affected oratory and an extravagant delivery were first practiced by those who vary from the regular established church nor is there any manner so unbecoming and indecent which has not at one time or another been accounted truly spiritual and graceful snuffling through the nose with an harmonious twang has been regarded as a kind of churchmusic best calculated to raise devotion and a piteous chorus of sighs and groans has been thought the most effectual call to repentance irregular tremblings of the voice and contortions of the person have long been the eloquence of quakers and presbyterians and are now the favorite mode of preaching practiced by those selfordained teachers who strike out new lights in religion and pour forth their extempore rhapsodies in a torrent of enthusiastical oratory an inspired cobbler will thunder out anathemas with the tone and gesture of st paul from a jointstool and an enlightened bricklayer will work himself up to such a pitch of vehemence as shall make his audience quake again i am sorry to see our regular divines rather copying than reforming this hot and extravagant manner of preaching and have with pain been witness to a wild intemperate delivery in our parishchurches which i should only have expected at the chapel in longacre or at the foundery and tabernacle in moorfields  as a serious earnestness in the delivery and a nervous simplicity in the style of a discourse are the most becoming ornaments of the pulpit so an affectation of eloquence is no where so offensive the delivery of a preacher as well as his diction should like his dress be plain and decent inflamed eloquence and wild gestures are unsuitable to the place and his function and though such vehement heat may perhaps kindle the zeal of a few enthusiastic old beldams in the isle it has a very different effect on the more rational part of the congregation i would therefore recommend it to our fashionable divines to aim at being preachers rather than orators or actors and to endeavor to make their discourses appear like sermons rather than orations  just published in two neat pocket volumes price six shillings bound  with a new

in spain it is the custom for husbands never to let their wives go abroad without a watchful old woman to attend them and in turkey it is the fashion to lock up their mistresses under the guard of a trusty eunuch but i never knew that in any country the men were put under the same restrictions alas sir my wife is to me a very duena she is as careful of me as the keisler aga or chief eunuch is of the grand signiors favorite sultana and whether she believes that i am in love with every woman or that every woman is in love with me she will never trust me out of her sight but sticks as close to me as if she really was without a figure bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh i am never suffered to stir abroad without her lest i should go astray and at home she follows me up and down the house like a child in leadingstrings nay if i do but step down stairs on any ordinary occasion she is so afraid i shall give her the slip that she always screams after me my dear you are not going out though for better security she generally locks up my hat and cane together with her own gloves and cardinal that one might not stir out without the other  i cannot flatter myself that i am handsomer or better made than other men nor has she in my eyes at least fewer charms than other women need i add that my complexion is not oversanguine nor my constitution very robust besides we have not been married above a month and yet she is so very doubtful of my constancy that i cannot speak or even pay the compliment of my hat to any young lady though in public without giving new alarms to her jealousy such an one she is sure from her flaunting airs is a kept madam another is no better than she should be and she saw another tip me the wink or give me a nod as a mark of some private assignation between us a nun sir might as soon force her way into a convent of monks as any young woman get admittance into our house she has therefore affronted all her acquaintance of her own sex that are not or might not have been the grandmothers of many generations and is at home to nobody but maiden ladies in the bloom of threescore and beauties of the last century  she will scarce allow me to mix even with persons of my own sex and she looks upon batchelors in particular as no better than pimps and common seducers one evening she indeed vouchsafed to trust me out of doors at a tavern with some of my malefriends but the first bottle had scarce gone round before word was brought up that my boy was come with the lanthorn to light me home i sent him back with orders to call in an hour when presently after the maid was dispatched with notice that my dear was gone to bed very ill and wanted me directly i was preparing to obey the summons when to our great surprise the sick lady herself bolted into the room complained of my cruel heart and fell into a fit from which she did not recover till the coach had set us down at our own house she then called me the basest of husbands and said that all taverns were no better than bawdyhouses and that men only went thither to meet naughty women at last she declared it to be her firm resolution that i should never set my foot again in any one of them except herself be allowed to make one of the company  you will suppose sir that while my wife is thus cautious that i should not be led astray when abroad she takes particular care that i should not stumble on temptations at home for this reason as soon as i had brought her to my house my two maidservants were immediately turned away at a moments warning not without out many covert hints and some open accusations of too near an intimacy between us though i protest to you one was a feeble old wrinkled creature as haggard and frightful as mother shipton and the other a strapping wench as coarse and brawny as the female samson even my man john who had lived in the family for thirty years was packed off as being too well acquainted with his masters sly ways a chairwoman was forced to do our work for some time before madam could suit herself with maids for her purpose one was too pert an hussy another went too fine another was an impudent forward young baggage at present our household is made up of such beautiful monsters as caliban himself might fall in love with my ladys own waiting woman has a most inviting humpback and is so charmingly paralytic that she shakes all over like a chinese figure the housemaid squints most delightfully with one solitary eye which weeps continually for the loss of its fellow and the cook besides a most captivating red face and protuberant waist has a most graceful hobble in her gait occasioned by one leg being shorter than the other  i need not tell you that i must never write a letter but madam must see the contents before it is done up and that i never durst open one till she has broke the seal or read it till she has first run it over every rap from the postman at the door makes her tremble and i have known her ready to burst with spleen at seeing a superscription written in a fair italian hand though perhaps it only comes from my aunt in the country she can pick out an intrigue even from the impression on the wax and a cupid or two hearts joined in union or a wafer pricked with a pin or stamped with a thimble she interprets as the certain tokens of a billetdoux the other week i received a letter from derbyshire which awakened all her mistrust she knew from the scrawl and strange spelling on the outside that it must come from a woman she therefore tore it open in a violent rage in hopes of making a most material discovery but to her great disappointment the contents were perfectly illegible she was now convinced that it came from some nasty creature whom i maintained in the country and that we corresponded together in cipher i was obliged to confess the truth that it was indeed drawn up in cipher and that i had the key to it at length with much ado i explained the whole matter to her telling her that it was a letter from my farmer who not having been bred at a writingschool expressed his meaning by characters of his own invention however this assurance did not at all pacify her till she had dispatched a trusty messenger to be certified of the truth  this loving creature happened to be taken ill lately when she thought that she was going to die she called me to her bedside and with tears in her eyes told me that she should not be able to die in peace except i would promise her one thing i assured her i would promise any thing to make her easy  o my dear says she i cannot bear the thought of your being anothers and therefore i shall not rest in my grave if you do not swear to me that you will never marry again or think of another woman as long as you live my poor dear is however recovered without putting my faith to so hard a trial though i may venture to say that i have already had so much of matrimony i could submit to any conditions to part with her  i

censorgeneral number cxxviii thursday july        felix convivium in quod choraules non venit mart to mr town sir my wife is mad stark mad and unless you can prescribe some remedy for that strange phrenzy that possesses her my peace of mind must be for ever broken and my fortune inevitably ruined you must know sir that she is afflicted with a disorder exactly opposite to the bite of a tarantula for as that is said to admit of no cure but music there is not a note in the gamut but what tends to heighten and inflame my wifes lunacy i find it is the fashion in this age for singers and fiddlers to publish appeals to the public wherefore as you have hitherto listened to the complaints of husbands i must beg you now to consider mine and to suffer me also to appeal to the public by means of your paper  a few years ago business called me over to italy where this unfortunate woman received the first touches of this disorder she soon conceived a violent passion for taste in general which settled at last in an unquenchable rage after musical compositions solos sonatas operas and concertos became her sole employment and delight and singers and musicians her only company at length full of italian airs she returned to england where also her whole happiness has been centered in the orchestra and it has been her whole pride to be thought a connoisseur in music if there is an opera oratorio or concert to be performed within the bills of mortality i do not believe that the riches of the indies could prevail on her to be absent two and only two good consequences attend this madness and those are that she constantly attends st jamess chapel for the sake of the anthem and the rest of the music and out of the many pounds idly squandered on minums and semiquavers some few are dedicated to charities which are promoted by musical performances  but what makes this rage after catgut more irksome and intolerable to me is that i have not myself the least idea of what they call taste and it almost drives me mad to be pestered with it i am a plain man and have not the least spice of a connoisseur in my composition yet nothing will satisfy my wife unless i appear as fond of such nonsense as herself about a month ago she prevailed on me to attend her to the opera where every dying fall made her expire as well as lady townly she was ravished with one air in ecstasies at another applauded ricciarelli encored mingotti and in short acted like an absolute madwoman while the performance and her behavior had a quite different effect upon me who sat dumb with confusion most musical most melancholy at her elbow when we came home again she seemed as happy as harmony could make her but i must own that i was all discord and most heartily vexed at being made a fool in public well my dear said she how do you like the opera  zouns madam i would as soon be dragged through a horsepond as go to an opera with you again  o fie but you must be delighted with the mingotti  the mingotti the devil  well i am sorry for it sir aaron but i find you have no ear  ear madam i had rather cut off my ears than suffer them to make me an idiot to this she made me no reply but began a favorite opera tune and after taking a tour round the room like one of the singers left me alone  if my wife could be satisfied like other musical ladies with attending public performances and now and then thrumming on her harpsicord the tunes she hears there i should be content but she has also a concert of her own constantly once a week here she is in still greater raptures than at the opera as all the music is chosen and appointed by herself the expense of this whim is monstrous for not one of these people will open their mouths or rosin a single string without being very well paid for it then she must have all the best hands and voices and has almost as large a set of performers in pay as the manager of the opera it puts me quite out of patience to see these fellows strutting about my house dressed up like lords and gentlemen not a single fiddler or singer but what appears in lace or embroidery and i once mistook my wifes chief musician for a foreign ambassador  it is impossible to recount the numberless follies to which this ridiculous passion for music exposes her her devotion to the art makes her almost adore the professors of it a musician is a greater man in her eye than a duke and she would sooner oblige an operasinger than a countess she is as busy in promoting their benefits as if she was to have the receipts of the house and quarrels with all her acquaintance who will not permit her to load them with tickets every fiddler in town makes it his business to scrape an acquaintance with her and an italian is no sooner imported than she becomes a part of my wifes band of performers in the late opera disputes she has been a most furious partizan and it is impossible for any patriot to feel more anxiety for the danger of blakeney and minorca than she has suffered on account of the opera and the loss of mingotti  i do not believe my wife has a single idea except recitative airs countertenor thoroughbass etc which are perpetually singing in her head when we sit together instead of joining in any agreeable conversation she is always either humming a tune or discoursing most eloquent music nature has denied her a voice but as italy has given her taste and a graceful manner she is continually squeaking out strains less melodious than the harmony of balladsinging in our streets or psalmsinging in a country church to make her still more ridiculous she learns to play on that masculine instrument the bassviol the pleasure of which nothing can prevail on her to forego as the bassviol she daily tells me contains the whole power and very soul of harmony  what method mr town shall i pursue to cure my wife of this musical phrenzy i have some thoughts of holding weekly a burlesque rorotorio composed of mockairs with grand accompanyments of the jews harp wooden spoons and marrowbones and cleavers on the same day with my wifes concert and have actually sent to two of mrs midnights hands to teach me the art and mystery of playing on the broomstick and hurdygurdy at the same time that my wife learns on the bassviol i have also a strong rough voice which will enable me to roar out bumper squire jones roast beef or some other old english ballad whenever she begins to trill forth her melodious airs in italian if this has no effect i will learn to beat the drum or wind the posthorn and if i should still find it impossible for noise and clamor to overcome the sound of her voices and instruments i have halfresolved peremptorily to shut my doors against singers and fiddlers and even to demolish her harpsichord and bassviol  but this alas is coming to extremities which i am almost afraid to venture and would endeavor to avoid i have no aversion to music but i would not be a fiddler nor do i dislike company but i would as soon keep an inn as convert my house into a theater for all the idle things of both sexes to assemble at but my wifes affections are so wedded to the gamut that i cannot devise any means to wean her from this folly if i could make her fond of dress or teach her to love cards plays or any thing but music i should be happy this method of destroying my peace with harmony is no better than tickling me to death and to squander away such sums of money on a parcel of bawling scraping rascals in laced coats and bagwigs is absolutely giving away my estate for an old song you mr town are a professed connoisseur therefore either give me a little taste or teach my wife to abandon it for at present we are but a jangling pair and there is not the least harmony between us though like bass and treble

mart to mr town sir i am a rich old bachelor and like other ancient gentlemen of that order and very fond of being indulged in all my odd humors and always having my own way this is one reason i never married for if my wife had been a shrewish termagant she would have killed me and if she had been a tame domestic animal i should have killed her but the way of life i have now fallen into is of all others the best calculated to gratify my fantastical temper i have no near relation indeed to treat as an humble cousin all my life in hopes of being happy at my death yet i abound in sycophants and followers all whom i delude like another volpone with the expectations of being made my heir the abject spirit of these wretches flatters me and amuses me i am indolent and hate contradiction and can safely say that not one of my acquaintance has contradicted me for these seven years there is not one of them but would be glad if i would spit in his face or rejoice at a kick of the breech from me if they thought i meant it as a token of my familiarity when i am grave they appear as dull as mutes at a funeral when i smile they grin like monkies when i tell a silly story they chuckle over every ridiculous particular and shake their sides in admiration of my wit sometimes i pretend to be shortsighted and then not one of them sees farther than his nose they swallow sour wine eat musty victuals and are proud to ride in my old boots  i have been told of a certain prelate who brought his chaplains to such a degree of servility that after every deal at whist they would ask him what he would choose to have for trumps next deal i keep my fellows in equal good order they all think me a close old hunks and imagining that winning their money will put me in good humor with them they practice all the arts of sharping to cheat themselves i have known them pack the cards at whist that i might hold all the four honors in my own hand they will load the dice in my favor at hazard pocket themselves on purpose at billiards and at bowls if any one is near winning the game he never fails in the next cast to mistake his biass it is impossible for the most despotic monarch to be more absolute over his subjects than i am over these slaves and sycophants yet in spite of all their endeavors to oblige me i most heartily despise them and have already drawn up a will in which i have bequeathed to each of them a shilling and a dogcollar  but though i have settled in my mind what legacies i shall leave them i have not thoroughly resolved in what manner i shall dispose of the bulk of my estate indeed i am fully determined like most other wealthy bachelors either to leave my fortune to some ostentatious pious uses or to persons whom i have never seen and for whose characters i have not the least regard or esteem to speak sincerely ostentation carries away my whole heart but then it is a little difficult to find out a new object to indulge my vanity whilst i am on this side the grave by securing to me a certain prospect of posthumous fame which is always so agreeable to living pride  the hospitals are so numerous that my name will be lost among those more known and established of guy morden bancroft and i know not who besides in the space of four or five centuries perhaps it may be thought notwithstanding my whole length picture and statue that i had assistance from parliament if i order my money to be laid out in churches they will never be built if in temple gardens lakes obelisks and serpentine rivers the next generation of the sons of taste will demolish all my works turn my rounds into squares and my squares into rounds and not leave even my bust although it were cast a plaster of paris by mr racstrow or worked up in wax by mr goupy or supposing in imitation of some of my predecessors i were to bequeath my fortune to my housekeeper and recommend her in my will as a pattern of virtue diligence and every good quality what will be the effect in three weeks after my death she will marry an irishman and i shall not even enjoy my monument and marble perriwig in westminsterabby  nothing perplexes me so much as the disposal of my money by my last will and testament while i am living it procures the most servile compliance with all my whims from my sycophants and several other conveniences but i would fain buy fame with it after my death do but instruct me how i may lay it out in the most valuable purchases of this sort only discover some new object of charity and perhaps i may bequeath you a round sum of money for your advice  i am sir your humble servant thomas vainall   it is said by an old poet that no mans life can be called happy or unhappy till his death in like manner i have often thought that no words or actions are a better comment on a persons temper and disposition than his last will and testament this is a true portraiture of himself drawn at full length by his own hand in which the painting is commonly very lively and the features very strongly marked in the discharge of this solemn act people sign and seal themselves either wise and good characters or villains and sools and any person that makes a ridiculous will and bequeaths his money to frivolous uses only takes a great deal of pains like dogberry in the play that he may be set down and ass  the love of fame governs our actions more universally than any other passion all the rest gradually drop off but this runs through our whole lives this perhaps is one of the chief inducements that influences wealthy persons to bequeath their possessions to ostentatious uses and they would as willingly lay out a considerable sum in buying a great name if possible at their deaths as they would bestow it on the purchase of a coat of heraldry during their lives they are pleased with leaving some memorial of their existence behind them and to perpetuate the remembrance of themselves by the application of their money of some vainglorious purposes though the good gentlemen never did one act to make themselves remarkable laid out a single shilling in a laudable manner while they lived if an apotheosis were to be bought how many rich scoundrels would be deified after their deaths not a plumb in the city but would purchase this imaginary godship as readily as he paid for his freedom at his first setting up and i doubt not but this fantastical distinction would be more frequent on an escutcheon than a coronet  the disposal of our fortunes by our last will should be considered as the discharge of a sacred trust which we should endeavor to execute in a just manner and as we have had the enjoyment of rich possessions we ought carefully to provide that they may devolve to those who have the most natural claim to them they who may first demand our favor are those who are allied to us by the ties of blood next to these stand those persons to whom we are connected by friendship and next to our friends and relations mankind in general but the humanity of a testator will not be thought very extensive though it reaches to posterity or includes the poor in general if it neglects the objects of charity immediately under his eye or those individuals who have the best title to his benevolence virgil has placed those rich men who bestowed none of their wealth on their relations among the chief personages in his hell wherefore i would advise my good correspondent mr vainall first to consider whether he has not some poor relation starving perhaps in some distant part of the kingdom after that let him look round whether he has not some friends whom he may possibly relieve from misery and distress but if he has no relation nor no person in the world that has any regard for him before he begins to endow a college or found an hospital i should take it as a particular favor if he would leave his money to me and will promise to immortalize his memory in the connoisseur  the connoisseur by mr town critic and censorgeneral

till the other is told i am sir the unfortunate wife of that inelegant i had almost said insensible husband who in your paper of the eighth instant pronounces and publishes me to be mad stark mad  i confess and glory in my passion for music and can there be a nobler or a more generous one my nerves are naturally strung to harmony and variously affected by the various combinations of the gamut some stay in italy added skill and taste in composition to my natural happy disposition to music and the best judges as well as the best performers in that country allowed me to have an uncommon share of virtu i both compose and perform sir and though i say it perhaps few even of the profession possess the contrapunto and the cromatic better and i have had the unspeakable pleasure of hearing my compositions and my performances dignified in italy with the unanimous appellations of squisito divino and adorevole  is there any madness in this does not he better deserve that imputation whose breast is insensible and impenetrable to all charms and powers of harmony to be plain i mean my husband whom i have frequently seen yawn nay leave the room in the middle of the most touching pathetic sung by the most affecting signora mingotti accompanied by the divine signor di giardino and yet  pardon this digressive transport  how irresistible is the expression the melody the cadences the

loss has this country sustained my good man among his other qualifications is a politician you must know and one of his principal objections against these virtuosi is that they are foreigners he flew into a violent passion with me last sunday night because i had a concert at my house when he said such bad news were received from abroad i know not what he and other muddyheaded politicians may think but let him talk what he will of the blakeney the governor the admiral i am sure the nation cannot sustain a greater evil than the loss of the mingotti who as the public prints will inform you is gone to holland till her affairs in england can be settled  but however gothic my husband may be i am fully determined to discharge the duty of a good wife accordingly whenever he comes into my room i sit down to my harpsichord and sing and play the most soothing pieces of music in hopes some time or other of hitting his unison but hitherto to no purpose and to say the truth i fear he has not one harmonic nerve in his whole system though otherwise a man of good plain sense when he interrupts my performances as in his letter he owns that he does with wishing for the men from mother midnights with their wooden spoons saltboxes jewsharps and broomsticks to play in concert with me i answer him with all gentleness and calmness imaginable  indeed my dear you have not the least notion of these things it would be impossible to bring those ridiculous instruments into a concert and to adapt a thorough bass to them they have not above three notes at most and those cannot be softenute  i wish for all that answers he that they were here i should like them better than all your signors and signoras and i am sure they would cost a great deal less  this article of expense he often dwells upon and sometimes even with warmth to which i reply with all the mildness that becomes a good wife my dear you have a good fortune of your own and i brought you still a better of what use is money if not employed and how can it be better employed than in encouraging and rewarding distinguished gusto and merit these people that you call balladsingers and pipers are people of birth though for the most part of small fortunes and they are much more considered as you know in italy than all the greatest ancient roman heroes if revived would now be many of them who would perhaps make a figure in the church or the state have been considerable losers by devoting themselves to the pleasures of mankind they leave their own country where they are infinitely esteemed for their moral as well as their musical characters and generously sacrifice all these advantages to our diversion besides my dear what should we do wish our money would you lavish it away upon foundling bastards lyingin women who have either no husbands or too many importunate beggars all whose cries and complaints are the most shocking discords or suppose that we were to save our money and leave our children better fortunes who knows but they might as too many do squander them away idly whereas what we give to these virtuosi we know is given to merit for my own part my dear i have infinite pleasure when i can get any of them to accept of fifty or an hundred guineas which by the way cannot always be brought about without some art and contrivance for they are most exceedingly nice and delicate upon the point of honor especially in the article of money and i look upon such trifling presents as a debt due to superior talents and merit and i endeavor to insinuate them in a way that the receiver may not blush  here my

of mind so totally unfits a man for all the social offices of life as indolence an idle man is a mere blank in the creation he seems made for no end and lives to no purpose he cannot engage himself in any employment or profession because he will never have diligence enough to follow it he can succeed in no undertaking for he will never pursue it he must be a bad husband father and relation for he will not take the least pains to preserve his wife children and family from starving and he must be a worthless friend for he would not draw his hand from his bosom though to prevent the destruction of the universe if he is born poor he will remain so all his life which he will probably end in a ditch or at the gallows if he embarks in trade he will be a bankrupt and if he is a person of fortune he stewards will acquire immense estates and he himself perhaps will die in the fleet  it should be considered that nature did not bring us into the world in a state of perfection but has left us in a capacity of improvement which should seem to intimate that we should labor to render ourselves excellent very few are such absolute idiots as not to be able to become at least decent if not eminent in their several stations by unwearied and keen application nor are there any possessed of such transcendant genius and abilities as to render all pains and diligence unnecessary perseverance will overcome difficulties which at first appear insuperable and it is amazing to consider how great and numerous obstacles may be removed by a continual attention to any particular point i will not mention here the trite example of demosthenes who got over the greatest natural impediments to oratory but content myself with a more modern and familiar instance being at sadlers wells a few nights ago i could not but admire the surprising feats of activity there exhibited and at the same time reflected what incredible pains and labor it must have cost the performers to arrive at the art of writhing their bodies into such various and unnatural contortions but i was most taken with the ingenious artist who after fixing two bells to each foot the same number to each hand and with great propriety placing a cap and bells on his head played several tunes and went through as regular triple peals and bob majors as the boys at christ church hospital all which he effected by the due jerking of his arms and legs and nodding his head backward and forward if this artist had taken equal pains to employ his head in another way he might perhaps have been as deep a proficient in numbers as jedediah buxton or at least a tolerable modern rhimer of which he is now no bad emblem and if our fine ladies would use equal diligence they might fashion their minds as successfully as madam catharina distorts her body  there is not in the world a more useless idle animal than he who contents himself with being merely a gentleman he has an estate therefore he will not endeavor to acquire knowledge he is not to labor in any vocation therefore he will do nothing but the misfortune is that there is no such thing in nature as negative virtue and that absolute idleness is impracticable he who does no good will certainly do mischief and the mind if it is not stored with useful knowledge will necessarily become a magazine of nonsense and trifles wherefore a gentleman though he is not obliged to rise to open his shop or work at his trade may always find some ways of employing his time to advantage if he makes no advances in wisdom he will become more and more a slave to folly and he that does nothing because he has nothing to do will become vicious and abandoned or at best ridiculous and contemptible  there is not a more melancholy object than a man of an honest heart and fine natural abilities whose good qualities are thus destroyed by indolence such a person is a constant plague to all his friends and acquaintance with all the means in his power of adding to their happiness and suffers himself to rank among the lowest characters when he might render himself conspicuous among the highest nobody is more universally beloved and more universally avoided than my friend careless he is a humane man who never did a beneficent action and a man of unshaken integrity on whom it is impossible to depend with the best head and the best heart he regulates his conduct in the most absurd manner and frequently injures his friends for whoever neglects to do justice to himself must inevitably wrong those with whom he is connected and it is by no means a true maxim that an idle man hurts nobody but himself  virtue then is not to be considered in the light of mere innocence or abstaining from harm but as the exertion of our faculties in doing good as titus when he had let a day slip undistinguished by some act of virtue cried out i have lost a day if we regard our time in this light how many days shall we look back upon as irretrievably lost and to how narrow a compass would such a method of calculation frequently reduce the longest life if we were to number our days according as we have applied them to virtue it would occasion strange revolutions in the manner of reckoning the ages of men we should see some few men arrived to a good old age in the prime of their youth and meet with several young fellows of fourscore  agreeable to this way of thinking i remember to have met with the epitaph of an aged man four years old dating his existence from the time of his reformation from evil courses the inscriptions on most tombstones commemorate no acts of virtue performed by the persons who lie under them but only record that they were born one day and died another but i would fain have those people whose lives have been useless rendered of some service after their deaths by affording lessons of instruction and morality to those they leave behind them wherefore i could wish that in every parish several acres were marked out for a new and spacious buryingground in which every person whose remains are there deposited should have a small stone laid over them reckoning their age according to the manner in which they have improved or abused the time allotted them in their lives in such circumstances the plate on a coffin might be the highest panegyric which the deceased could receive and a little square stone inscribed with ob ann aetat  0 would be a nobler eulogium than all the lapidary adulation of modern epitaphs in a buryingground of this nature allowing for the partiality of survivors which would certainly point out the most brilliant actions of their dead friends we might perhaps see some inscriptions not much unlike the following  here lie the remains of a celebrated beauty aged  0 who died in the fifth year of her

know not any greater misfortune that can happen to a young fellow at his first setting out in life than his falling into low company he that sinks to a familiarity with persons much below his own level will be constantly weighed down by his base connections and though he may easily plunge still lower he will find it impossible ever to rise again we cannot give a liberal turn of mind to a vulgar by introducing him to genteel company any more than we can make a beau of him by dressing him in embroidery but a gentlemen will as naturally catch the manners of a blackguard by mixing with blackguards as he would daub his clothes with foot by running against a chimneysweeper  by low company i would not be supposed to mean the best and most valuable part of mankind which have been distinguished by the name of middling sort of people though i am not ignorant that these are despised by all who would be thought to keep the best company the apes of quality affect to look upon all others who have no relish for the amusements of high life or do not choose to pay a guinea for their ordinary as downright vulgars and it was with the utmost contempt i once heard a young coxcomb of fashion speak of a most intimate friend that he should be forced to drop his acquaintance because he kept such low company neither would i confine this appellation solely to the inferior order of tradesmen and mechanics or the whole body of the mobility in general for although this rank of people may be literally said to be in low life a right honorable who lets himself down to the manners of a porter or a hackneycoachman differs from them in nothing but his title  a propensity to low company is either owing to an original meanness of spirit a want of education or an illplaced pride commonly arising from both the forementioned causes those who are naturally of a grovelling disposition show it even at school by choosing their playmates from the scum of the class and are never so happy as when they can steal down to romp with the servants in the kitchen but the most frequent cause is the desire of being as it is called the head of the company and a person of this humble ambition will be very well content to pay the reckoning for the honor of being distinguished by the title of the gentleman it sometimes happens that a man of genius and learning will stoop to receive the incense of mean and illiterate flatterers in a porterhouse or a cydercellar and i remember to have heard of a poet who was once caught in a bawdy house in the very fact of reading his verses to the good old mother and a circle of her daughters  there are some who have been led into low company merely from an affectation of humor and from a notion of seeing life and a desire of being

cultivated an intimacy with buckhorse and is very proud of being sometimes admitted to the honor of conversing with the great broughton himself he is also very well known among the hackneycoachmen as

one of his companions was unfortunately brought thither when bob carried his regard for his deceased friend so far as to get himself knocked down in endeavoring to rescue the body from the surgeons

but if we afterward turn our eyes on those few who are employed in exercising their talents in westminster hall this prodigious army of lawyers shrinks to a very thin and inconsiderable corpse thousands it seems are disgusted with the unpleasing dryness of the study as it is now managed and conceive an unconquerable aversion to the white leaves and the old black letter this early dislike to legal enquiries certainly proceeds from the fatal mistakes in the plan of study hitherto marked out according to all systems now extant it is absolutely impossible to be at once a lawyer and a fine gentleman seeing with concern the many evils arising from these erroneous principles i have at length devised a method to remedy all these inconveniences a method now very successfully practiced by several young gentlemen wherefore i must beg leave to submit my thoughts to the public by means of your paper and to chalk out the outlines of a treatise now ready for the press entitled the complete barrister or a new institute of the laws of england  my lord coke prescribes to our student to follow the advice given in the ancient verses prefixed to this letter for the good spending of the day six hours to sleep six to the study of the law four to prayer two to meals and the rest to the muses but what an absurd and unfashionable distribution of the four and twenty hours i will venture a thousand pounds to a shilling that not one student in the kingdom divides his time in this manner here is not a single word of vauxhall ranelagh the theaters or other public diversions not to mention that nobody but a methodist would ever think of praying four hours and that it would be impossible though we were content with snapping up a chop every day at bettys to dispatch even dinner in two how then shall we reconcile these precepts scarce practicable by a hermit to the life of a young gentleman who keeps the best company or how can these rules for severe application be made consistent with the practice of those who divide their whole time between eating drinking sleeping and amusements well knowing that the volatile dispositions of the young gentlemen of the present age can never submit the ordering of their lives to any prescribed rules i have endeavored to square my precepts to their lives and have so contrived the matter that amidst the keenest persuit of their pleasures they shall be engaged in the most improving course of the law  as laws are chiefly nothing else but rules of action what can be more cruel and absurd than to coop up a brisk young man to learn in his chambers what he can so much better teach himself by going abroad into the world i propose to dose gentlemen with study as dr rock does with physic to be taken at home or abroad without loss of time or hindrance of business this i am convinced is not only the best method but also the only scheme which several inhabitants of the inns of court would ever follow i shall not at present forestall the contents of my treatise by presenting you with a dry abstract of it but rather endeavor to give you an idea of the spirit and manner in which it is written by delineating the plan diligently persued by one of my favorite pupils and i cannot but congratulate the bar that so many young men instead of blinding their eyes and bewildering their understandings with coke plowden salkeld etc have sense enough to follow the same course of study  tom riot the principal ornament of my class of students was sent to the temple not with any intention that he should become a great lawyer but merely because for a few years his father did not know how to dispose of him otherwise but so unwearied has been his application to the new method that his father and the rest of his friends will i doubt not be surprised at his wonderful proficiency as nothing is of more consequence to those gentlemen who intend to harangue at the bar than the acquiring a ready elocution and an easy habit of delivering their thoughts in public to this i paid particular attention for this purpose i advised him to a diligent attendance on the theaters and i assure you mr town he never fails to take notes at a new play and seldom or never misses appearing at one house or the other in the green boxes he has also gathered many beautiful flowers of rhetoric unblown upon by all other orators ancient or modern from the robin hood society and at the same place he has collected the strongest arguments on every subject and habituated himself to modes of reasoning never hitherto introduced into courts of justice but what has been of more than ordinary service to him and is particularly recommended by lord coke himself who calls conference the life of study is his so frequent attendance at georges and the other coffeehouses about the temple where every student has so many opportunities of benefiting himself by daily conversation with counselors attorneys clerks to attorneys and other sages of law  the law is intended to take cognizance of all our actions wherefore my pupil who is fond of exerting his faculties in polite life has already digested almost all the grand leading points of the law into a journal of his transactions which i shall lay before my readers at large in my treatise as the best method for a commonplacebook thus for instance having been frequently employed after leaving the shakespeare in what is called beating the rounds it has happened to him to be taken into custody by the magistrate of the night and carried the next morning before a justice by which means he has attained as full a knowledge of certain parts of the duty of a constable and justice of peace as could be collected from dalton blackerby or burn certain impertinences of his tailor and other tradesmen have given him a very clear notion of the laws of arrest and been of as much service to him as the best treatises on bail and mainprize besides which the several sums of money which he has taken up at different times payable on his fathers death have opened to him some difficult points in conveyancing by teaching him the nature of bonds deeds etc and have at the same time shown him what lord coke calls the amiable and admirable secrets of the common law by unravelling to him the intricate doctrines of reversion and remainder as well as the general nature of estates thus he is continually improving and whenever he should happen to commit a rape or a genteel murder it will serve him for matter of instruction as well as any history of the pleas of the crown and give him an insight into the nature of the practice and extent of the jurisdiction of our courts of justice  by this plan of study no time is lost so that while other students are idling away their vacation in the country my pupil is daily improving there as he is a member of the association he is very conversant in all the laws enacted for the preservation of the game and he picks up all the learning of the circuit by dancing at the balls at the assizes as his father has a place he is employed in canvassing for votes at the time of an election which instructs him in all the points of law touching those matters he was principally concerned in discovering the customary tenants the new species of freeholders unknown to littleton coke and all the lawyers of antiquity and he is so intimately acquainted with all the doctrine contained in the several clauses of the bribery act that i propose publishing in the body of my treatise les readings del mon seignior riot sur lestatute de   geo   etc  by this time mr town you must perceive that the ground of my scheme is in short no more than this viz that the student should regard his life as a kind of commentary on the law as it is recommended to the clergy to become examples of the doctrine they teach or to bring my illustration more home to these gentlemen let them learn the law by being occasionally interested in different parts of it as they become in some measure doctors of physic from frequent need of it and can cure themselves in certain cases as well as rock himself instead of poring over books a gentleman need only observe how far the law and his actions tally with each other and as it is said by lord coke that the knowledge of the law is like a deep well out of which each man draws according to the strength of his understanding so in persuance of my plan the student will improve according to the eagerness with which he engages in his pleasures and this no doubt was intended by lord coke as it is the most obvious interpretation of his words when he concludes the comparison by saying that when the professor of the law can dive into the depth it is delightful easy and without any heavy burden so long as he keep himself in his own proper element  what plan mr town can be more delightful easy and without any heavy burden than institutes of this nature i have indeed often looked with concern upon those unhappy gentlemen who have impaired their health by the old method of study and considered them as martyrs to huge volumes of reports and statutes at large my pupils will be in no danger of these misfortunes it is recorded of an eminent counselor of the north family who being one of the ablest practitioners at the bar was so overloaded with business that sometimes choosing to retire awhile from hurry and perplexity he would say to his clerk tell the people i do not practice this term this proper relaxation i always recommend to my pupils and have some reason to think they are prudent enough to embrace it for as i am acquainted with several students on the new plan and do not remember to have seen them doing any business in the courts for some time i suppose they had given notice to their clerks to tell the people that they did not practice in those terms  i am sir your humble servant ignoramus   the letter signed j c has been received and shall be duly regarded  the connoisseur by mr town critic and censorgeneral number cxxxiv thursday august          hom mr village to mr town dear cousin the country at present no less than the metropolis abounding with politicians of every kind i begun to despair of picking up any intelligence that might possibly be entertaining to your readers however i have made a tour to some of the most distant parts of the kingdom with a clergyman of my acquaintance and shall not trouble you with an account of the improvements that have been made in the seats we saw according to the modern taste but proceed to give you some reflections which occurred to us on observing several country churches and the behavior of their congregations  the ruinous condition of some of these churches gave me great offense and i could not help wishing that the honest vicar instead of indulging his genius for improvements by enclosing his gooseberry bushes with a chinese rail and converting half an acre of his glebeland into a bowlinggreen would have applied part of his income to the more laudable purpose of sheltering his parishioners from the weather during their attendance on divine service it is no uncommon thing to see the parsonag house well thatched and in exceeding good repair while the church perhaps has no better roof than the ivy that grows over it the noise of owls bats and magpies makes a principal part of the church music in many of these ancient edifices and the walls like a large map seem to be portioned out into capes seas and promontories by the various colors with which the damps have stained them sometimes it has happened that the foundation being too weak to support the steeple any longer it has been found expedient to pull down that part of the building and to hang the bells under a wooden shed on the ground beside it this is the case in a parish in norfolk through which i lately passed and where the clerk and the sexton like the two figures at st dunstans serve the bells in capacity of clappers by striking them alternately with a hammer  in other churches i have observed that nothing unseemly or ruinous is to be found except in the clergyman and in the appendages of his person the squire of the parish or his ancestors perhaps to testify their devotion and leave a lasting monument of their magnificence have adorned the altarpiece with the richest crimson velvet embroidered with vineleaves and ears of wheat and have dressed up the pulpit with the same splendor and expense while the gentleman who fills it is exalted in the midst of all this finery with a surplice as dirty as a farmers frock and a periwig that seems to have transferred its faculty of curling to the band that appears in fullbuckle beneath it  but if i was concerned to see many of our country churches in a tottering condition i was more offended with the indecency of worship in others i could wish that the pastors would inform their hearers that there is no occasion to scream themselves hoarse in making the responses that the towncryer is not the only person qualified to pray with due devotion and that he who bawls the loudest may nevertheless be the wickedest fellow in the parish the old women too in the ayle might be told that their time would be better employed in attending to the sermon than in fumbling over their tattered testaments till they have found the text by which time the discourse is near drawing to a conclusion while a word or two of instruction might not be thrown away upon the younger part of the congregation to teach them that making posies in summertime and cracking nuts in autumn is no part of the religious ceremony  the good old practice of psalmsinging is indeed wonderfully improved in many country churches since the days of sternhold and hopkins and there is scarce a parishclerk who has so little taste as not to pick his staves out of the new version this has occasioned great complaints in some places where the clerk has been forced to bawl by himself because the rest of the congregation cannot find the psalm at the end of their prayerbooks while others are highly disgusted at the innovation and stick as obstinately to the old version as to the old style the tunes themselves have also been newset to jiggish measures and the sober drawl which used to accompany the two first staves of the hundredth psalm with the gloria patri is now split into as many quavers as an italian air for this purpose there is in every county an itinerant band of vocal musicians who make it their business to go round to all the churches in their turns and after a prelude with the pitchpipe astonish the audience with hymns set to the new winchester measure and anthems of their own composing as these newfashioned psalmodists are necessarily made up of young men and maids we may naturally suppose that there is a perfect concord and symphony between them and indeed i have known it happen that these sweet singers have been brought more than once into disgrace by too close an unison between the thoroughbase and the treble  it is a difficult matter to decide which is looked upon to be the greatest man in a country church the parson or his clerk the latter is most certainly held in higher veneration where the former happens to be only a poor curate who rides post every sabbath from village to village and mounts and dismounts at the churchdoor the clerks office is not only to tag the prayers with an amen or usher in the sermon with a stave but he is also the universal father to give away the brides and the standing godfather to all the newborn brats but in many places there is a still greater man belonging to the church than either the parson or the clerk himself the person i mean is the squire who like the king may be styled head of the church in his own parish if the benefice be in his own gift the vicar is his creature and of consequence entirely at his devotion or if the care of the church is left to a curate the sunday fees of roast beef and plumb pudding and a liberty to shoot in the manor will bring him as much under the squires command as his dogs and horses for this reason the bell is often kept tolling and the people waiting in the churchyard an hour longer than the usual time nor must the service begin till the squire has strutted up the ayle and seated himself in the great pew in the chancel the length of the sermon is also measured by the will of the squire as formerly by the hourglass and i know one parish where the preacher has always the complaisance to break off to a conclusion the minute that the squire gives the signal by rising up after his nap  in a village church the squires lady or the vicars wife are perhaps the only females that are stared at for their finery but in the larger cities and towns where the newest fashions are brought down weekly by the stagecoach or wagon all the wives and daughters of the most topping tradesmen vie with each other every sunday in the elegance of their apparel i could even trace the gradations in their dress according to the opulence the extent and the distance of the place from london i was at church in a populous city in the north where the macebearer cleared the way for mrs mayoress who came sidling after him in an enormous fanhoop of a pattern which had never been seen before in those parts at another church in a corporationtown i saw several negligees with furbelowd aprons which had long disputed the prize of superiority but these were most woefully eclipsed by a burgesss daughter just come from london who appeared in a trolloppee or slammerkin with treble ruffles to the cuffs pinked and gymped and the sides of the petticoat drawn up in festoons in some lesser borough towns the contest i found lay between three or four black and green bibs and aprons at one a grocers wife attracted our eyes by a newfashioned cap called a joan and at another they were wholly taken up by a mercers daughter in a nuns hood  i need not say any thing of the behavior of the congregations in these more polite places of religious resort as the same genteel ceremonies are practiced there as at the most fashionable churches at the court end of the town the ladies immediately on their entrance breathe a pious ejaculation through their fansticks and the beaus very gravely address themselves to the haberdashers bills glewed upon the linings of their hats this pious duty is no sooner performed than the exercise of bowing and curtsying succeeds the locking and unlocking of the pews drowns the readers voice at the beginning of the service and the rustling of silks added to the whispering and tittering of so much good company renders him totally unintelligible to the very end of it  i am dear cousin yours etc   the connoisseur by mr town

censorgeneral number cxxxvi thursday september         hominem pagina nostra sapit mart we whose business it is to write loose essays and who never talk above a quarter of an hour together on any one subject are not expected to enter into philosophical disquisitions or engage in abstract speculations but it is supposed to be our principal aim to amuse and instruct the reader by a lively representation of what passes round about him thus like those painters who delineate the scenes of familiar life we sometimes give a sketch of a marriage a la mode sometimes draw the outlines of a modern midnight conversation at another time paint the comical distresses of itinerant tragedians in a barn and at another give a full draught of the rakes or harlots progress sometimes we divert the public by exhibiting single portraits and when we meet with a subject where the features are strongly marked by nature and there is something peculiarly characteristic in the whole manner we employ ourselves in drawing a full length in a word we consider all mankind as sitting for their pictures and endeavor to work up our pieces with lively traits and embellish them with beautiful coloring and though perhaps they are not always highly finished yet they seldom fail of pleasing some few at least of the vast multitude of critics and connoisseurs if we are so happy as to hit off a striking likeness  there is perhaps no knowledge more requisite and certainly none at present more ardently sought after than the knowledge of the world in this science we are more particularly expected to be adepts as well as to initiate or at least improve our readers in it and though this knowledge cannot be collected altogether from books yet as pope says men may be read as well as books too much and it is to be lamented that many who have only consulted the volume of life as it lay open before them have rather become worse than better by their studies they who have lived wholly in the world without regarding the comments on it are generally tainted with all its vices to which the gathering part of their instructions from books would perhaps have proved an antidote there indeed though they would have seen the faults and foibles of mankind fairly represented yet vice would appear in an odious and virtue in an amiable light but those who unwarned go abroad into the world are often dazzled by the splendour with which wealth gilds vice and infamy and being accustomed to see barefoot honesty treated with scorn are themselves induced to consider it as contemptible for this reason i am a good deal offended at the ingenious contrivance of our modern novellists and writers of comedy who often gloss over a villainous character with the same false varnish that lackers so many scoundrels in real life and while they are exhibiting a fellow who debauches your daughter or lies with your wife represent him as an agreeable creature a man of gallantry and a fine gentleman  the world even the gayest part of it may be painted like itself and yet become a lesson of instruction the pieces of hogarth to recur to the illustration i first made use of are faithful delineations of certain scenes of life and yet vice and folly always appear odious and contemptible i could wish it were possible to learn the knowledge of the world without being hackneyd in the ways of men but as that is impracticable it is still our duty so to live in it as to avoid being corrupted by our intercourse with mankind we should endeavor to guard against fraud without becoming ourselves deceitful and to see every species of vice and folly practiced round about us without growing knaves and fools the villainy of others is but a poor excuse for the loss of our own integrity and though indeed if i am attacked on hounslowheath i may lawfully kill the highwayman in my own defense yet i should be very deservedly brought to the gallows if i took a purse from the next person i met because i had been robbed myself  the knowledge of the world as it is generally understood consists not so much in a due reflection on its vices and follies as in the practice of them and those who consider themselves as best acquainted with it are either the dupes of fashion or slaves of interest it is also supposed to lie within the narrow compass of every mans own sphere of life and receives a different interpretation in different stations thus for instance the man of fashion seeks it nowhere but in the polite circle of the beaumonde while the man of business looks no farther for it than the alley i shall beg leave to illustrate this by two characters each of whom though diametrically opposite to the other has acquired a thorough knowledge of the world  sir harry flash had the good luck to be born before his brother richard consequently the heir to the estate was bred a gentleman and the other condemned to plod in the dull drudgery of business the merchant was sent to learn accounts at the academy upon tower hill and the baronet had the finishing of his education in france sir harry is now a most accomplished fine gentleman is an excellent judge of fashions and can calculate the odds at any game as readily as hoyle or demoivre the alderman is the most knowing man upon change and understands the rise and fall of stocks better than any jew both of them know the world but with this difference that one by his consummate knowledge has run out a large estate while the other has raised a plumb by it  before i conclude it will be proper to take notice of the great improvements made by our modern ladies in this part of their education the pretty creatures were formerly kept at home and employed in the domestic cares of good housewifery they were taught as much as possible to shun the company of the men and knew no more of the world than a cloistered nun but these restraints are now happily removed by the present mode of education the little lady instead of being sent to the boardingschool to learn needle work is introduced to the politest routs and assemblies and taught to make one at the cardtable she is carried about to vauxhall ranelagh and other genteel places of amusement and besides these if we add a trip to bath or cheltenham there is no doubt but she is completely versed in the knowledge of the world this we must own is very necessary to be attained by ladies of fashion but it is with great concern that i have observed the inferior rank of females frequenting the same schools and learning the same lessons some have purchased their knowledge very dearly at the expense of their reputation while others have laid out their whole fortunes to acquire it and i could not but smile the other day at reading an advertisement in the public papers begging our charity for a poor distressed gentlewoman who had formerly lived well and seen a great deal of the world  just published in two neat pocket volumes price six shillings bound  with a new translation of the mottos and quotations  the connoisseur by mr town critic and censorgeneral number cxxxvii thursday september        hunc comedendum and deridendum vobis propino ter to mr town sir what cloying meat is love when matrimony is the sauce to it says sir john brute but if he had been joined to such an epicurean consort as i those expressions that favor of the kitchen would have been real instead of metaphorical we live in a land really flowing with milk and honey and keep a house of entertainment for all comers and goers we hardly ever sit down to table less in number than twenty or thirty and very often to above double that number of dishes in short sir so much feasting has given me a surfeit  there are i see scattered up and down your papers several accounts of the petty distresses and domestic concerns of private families as you have listened to many complaints from husbands i flatter myself you will not refuse your attention to the humble remonstrance of a wife being assured that my only reason for thus serving up my dear lord as a new dish to gratify the public taste is to check if possible his violent passion for giveing his friends entertainments of another kind which if indulged much longer must eat us out of house and home  the magnificent feasts of timon of athens or the stories of old english hospitality would give you but a faint idea of the perpetual riot and luxury of our family our house is always stored with as large a quantity of provisions as a garrison in expectation of a siege and those too of the dearest and most extravagant kind ortolans and woodcocks are as plenty as sparrows and red mullets are scarce a greater rarity with us than gudgeons or sprats while turtle and venison are regarded as branches of citizenluxury which scarce deserve notice among the many other delicacies in which we abound authors they say you will pardon me mr town are seldom admitted to great entertainments and i can assure you that it is not easy for any but those who are present to conceive the parade and extravagance displayed in our house i myself am condemned to sit at the head of the table while my lord is placed at the other end in pain and uneasiness at my awkward mistakes in doing the honors you must know sir that i was bred up under an housewifely aunt in the country who taught me to pickle and preserve and gave me as i thought a tolerable notion of cookery but alas though i understand plain boiled and roast and have a very good notion of a pudding i am often totally ignorant of the names and compositions of the delicacies before me and have imagined fish to be fowl and mistaken a petit patee for a plebeian mincepie in the mean time my lord is displaying his exquisite taste by deciding upon every dish and pronouncing with a critical smack upon the flavor of the wines all the while not a little solicitous about the exactness of the removes and the duly adjusting the entremets claret burgundy and champagne are as common as ale or smallbeer and even hermitage and tokay are swallowed with as little remorse as port of lisbon to add to all this is most absurdly introduced the french custom of serving in les liqueurs which consist of almost as many sorts as are contained in the advertisements from the rich cordial warehouse in a word every common dinner with us is a feast and when we have what my lord calls an entertainment it is an absolute debauch  but there is no part of this monstrous expense affects me so much as the vast sums ridiculously lavished on a desert this piece of folly and extravagance could be nothing but the joint product of a frenchman and a confectioner after the gratification of the appetite with more substantial fare this whiptsyllabub rareeshew is served up chiefly to feed the eye not but that the materials of which the desert is composed are as expensive as the several ingredients in the dinner and i will leave you to your own method of rating the rest after telling you that my lord thinks himself an excellent oeconomist by having reduced the expense of the hothouse to a thousand per ann which perhaps the admirers of exotic fruits will not think dear as we have pineapples as plenty as goldenpippins or nonpareils  one would think that the first requisite in eating was extravagance and that in order to have any thing very good it must be eat at a time that it is out of season therefore one of the principal uses of our hothouse is to invert the order of nature and to turn winter into summer we should be ashamed to see peace upon our table while they are to be had at a common market but we never spare any cost to provide a good crop by the assistance of our hotbeds at christmas we have no relish for cucumbers during the summer months when they are no rarity but we take care to have them forced in november but my lord mostly prides himself on the improvements that he has made in his mushroombeds which he has at length brought to so great perfection that by the help of horsedung and throwing artificial sunbeams through a burningglass we can raise any quantity of mushrooms of the right italian kind at two hours warning  from the hothouse we may make a very natural transition to the kitchen and as in the former every thing must be produced out of season so every thing in the latter must undergo a strange metamorphosis the ordinary distinctions of fish flesh and fowl are quite destroyed and nothing comes upon table under its proper form and appellation it is impossible to conceive what vast sums are melted down into sauces we have a cargo of hams every year from westphalia only to extract the essence of them for our soups and we kill a brace of bucks every week to make a cullis of the haunches half a dozen turkies have been killed in one day merely for the sake of the pinions and i have known a whole pond dragged to furnish a dish of carps palates and ten legs of mutton mangled raw to make out a dish of popes eyes  the concomitant charges of the cellar you will imagine are no less extravagant and indeed it is not enough that we abound in the best french and italian wines which by the bye are purchased on the spot at an extraordinary price but we must have several other kinds of the highest value and consequently a most delicious flavor and though but a taste of each has been sipped round by the company the same bottles must never be brought a second time upon table but are secured as perquisites by the butler who fells them to the merchant who sells them back again to my lord besides these his lordship has lately been at an immense charge in raising a pinery in order to try the experiment of making cider of pineapples which he hopes to do at little more than treble the expense of champagne to this article i might also add the charge of his icehouses for although these are stored with an homecommodity originally of no value yet i may  to say that every drop of water comes as dear to us as the most costly of our wines  as all our liquors i have told you are of foreign growth and all our dishes distinguished by foreign titles you will readily conceive that our household is chiefly composed of foreigners the butler out of livery and his two underbutlers are frenchmen the clerk of the kitchen is a frenchman and monsieur fricando the headcook to be sure is a frenchman this gentleman never soils his fingers in touching the least bit of any thing but gives his orders like a general to four subalterns who are likewise frenchmen the baker the confectioner the very scullions and even the fellow that looks after the poultry are all of them frenchmen these you may be sure are maintained at very high salaries and though monsieur fricando had the pay of a captain in a marching regiment my lord was forced to double his wages at the beginning of the war and allow him the free exercise of his religion to prevent his leaving the kingdom  i am sorry to add that this pride of keeping a table has visibly impaired my lords fortunes and this very summer he has been obliged to fell all the timber on his estate as i may say to keep up his kitchen fire the only satisfaction he can possibly reap from all this expense is the vanity of having it said that nobody treats so elegantly as his lordship and now and then perhaps reading in the newspapers that such a day the right honorable  gave a grand entertainment at his house in  at which were present the principal officers of state and foreign ministers  i am sir your humble servant etc   the connoisseur by mr town critic and censorgeneral number cxxxviii thursday september          servata semper lege et ratione loquendi juv in the comedy of the frenchman in london which we are told was acted at paris with universal applause for several nights together there is a character of a rough englishman who is represented as quite unskilled in the graces of conversation and his dialogue is made up of almost nothing but a repetition of the common salutation of how do you do how do you do our nation has indeed been generally supposed to be of a sullen and uncommunicative disposition while on the other hand the loquacious french have been allowed to possess the art of conversing beyond all other people the englishman requires to be wound up frequently and stops as soon as he is down but the frenchman runs on in a continued alarm yet it must be acknowledged that as the english consist of very different humors their manner of discourse admits of great variety but the whole french nation converse alike and there is no difference in their address between a marquis and a valet de chamber we may frequently see a couple of french barbers accosting each other in the street and paying their compliments with the same volubility of speech and grimace of action as two courtiers in the thuilleries  i shall not attempt to lay down any particular rules for conversation but point out such faults in the discourse and behavior as render the company of half mankind rather tedious than amusing it is in vain indeed to look for conversation where we might expect to find it in the greatest perfection among persons of fashion where it is almost annihilated by universal cardplaying insomuch that i have heard it given as a reason why it is impossible for our present writers to succeed in the dialogue of genteel comedy that our people of quality scarce ever meet but to game all their discourse turns upon the odd trick and the four honors and it is no less a maxim with the votaries of whist than with those of bacchus that talking spoils company every one endeavors to make himself as agreeable to society as he can but it often happens that those who most aim at shining in conversation overshoot their mark and though a man succeeds he should not as is frequently the case engross the whole talk to himself for that destroys the very essence of conversation which is talking together we should try to keep up conversation like a ball bandied to and fro from one to the other rather than seize it all to ourselves and drive it before us like a football we should likewise be cautious to adapt the matter of our discourse to our company and not talk greek before the ladies or of the last new furbelow to a meeting of country justices  the pests and nuisances of society which are commonly to be met with may be ranged in the following manner and first the attitudinarians and facemakers these accompany every word with a peculiar grimace or gesture they assent with a shrug and contradict with a twisting of the neck are angry with a wry mouth and pleased in a caper or a minuet step they may be considered as speaking harlequins and their rules of eloquence are taken from the posturemaster these should be condemned to converse only in dumb show with their own persons in the lookingglass as also the smirkers and smilers who so prettily set off their faces together with their words by a je ne scai quoi between a grin and a dimple with these we may likewise rank the affected tribe of mimics who are constantly taking off the peculiar tone of voice or gesture of their acquaintance though they imitate humanity so abominably that like bad painters they are frequently forced to write the name under the picture before we can discover any likeness  next to these whose elocution consists chiefly in the action we may consider the professed speakers and first of the emphatical who squeeze and press and beat down every syllable with as much vehemence as a paviour thumps the pebbles with his rammer these energetic orators are remarkable for the force of expression with which they utter the particle the and conjunctive and which they seem to hawk up with much difficulty out of their own throats and to cram them with no less pain into the ears of their auditors these should be suffered only to syringe as it were the ears of a deaf man through an hearing trumpet and with these we may join the whisperers or low speakers who come up so close to you that they may be said to measure noses with you and have frequently a stinking breath i would have these oracular gentry obliged to talk at a distance through a speaking trumpet or apply their lips to the walls of a whispering gallery the wits who will not condescend to utter any thing but a bon mot and the whistlers or tunehummers who never articulate at all may be joined very agreeably together in concert and to these tinkling cymbals i would also add the sounding brass the bawler who inquires after your health with the bellowing of a towncryer  the tatlers whose pliable pipes are admirably adapted to the soft parts of conversation and sweetly prattling out of fashion make very pretty music from a beautiful face and a female tongue but from a rough manly voice and coarse features it is as harsh and dissonant as a jig from a bagpipe the halfswearers who split and mince and fritter their oaths into gads bud ads fish and demmee and the humbuggers and those who nickname gods creatures who call a man a cabbage a crab a queer cub an odd fish and an unaccountable muskin should never come into company without an interpeter but i shall not tire my readers patience by pointing out others no less destructive of society such as the sensibles who pronounce dogmatically on the most trivial points and speak in sentences the wonderers who are always wondering what oclock it is or wondering whether it will rain or no or wondering when the moon changes and lastly the silent men who seem afraid of opening their mouths for fear of catching cold and literally observe the precept of the gospel by letting their conversation be only yea yea and nay nay  the rational intercourse which is mutually kept up among men by conversing with each other is one of our principal distinctions from brutes and it is imagined by some philosophers that birds and beasts though without the power of articulation perfectly understand one another by the sounds they utter and that dogs cats etc have each a particular language to themselves like different nations thus it may be supposed that the nightingales of italy have as fine an ear for their own native woodnotes as any signor or signora for an italian air that the boars of westphalia gruntle as expressively through the nose as the inhabitants in highgerman and that the frogs in the dykes of holland croak as intelligibly as the natives jabber their high dutch however this may be we may consider those who let their tongues always vibrate as their hearts beat and do not keep up the proper conversation of human creatures as imitating the language of different animals thus for instance the affinity between chatterers and monkeys and praters and parrots is too obvious not to occur at once grunters and growlers may be justly compared to hogs snarlers are curs that continually show their teeth but never bite and the spitfire passionate are a sort of wild cats that will not bear stroaking but will purr when they are pleased complainers are scriechowls and storytellers who are always repeating the same dull note are cuckows poets that prick up their ears at their own hideous braying are no better than asses critics in general are venomous serpents that delight in hissing and some of them who have got by heart a few technical terms without knowing their meaning are no other than magpies i myself who have crowed to the whole town for near three years past may perhaps put my readers in mind of a dunghill cock but as i must acquaint them that they will hear the last of me on this day fortnight i hope they will then consider me as a swan who is supposed to sing sweetly at his dying moments  just published in two neat pocket volumes price six shillings bound  with a new translation of the mottos and quotations  the connoisseur by mr town critic and censorgeneral number cxxxix thursday september          sum superbiam quaesitam meritis  hor i wrote to my cousin village informing him of my design to finish with the next number and i have received the following answer from him which i shall lay before my readers  dear cousin it was not without some regret that i received advice of your intentions to bid adieu to the public for as you had been so kind as to introduce me to their notice i began to indulge all the weakness and vanity of a young author and had almost persuaded myself that i was the principal support of your papers conscious of my own importance i expect that you will do me the justice to acknowledge how much you are indebted to the assistance of your very ingenious cousin and i care not how many compliments you pay me on my wit and learning but at the same time i must beg leave to put in a caveat against your disposing of me in what manner you yourself please writers of essays think themselves at liberty to do what they will with the characters they have introduced into their works as writers of tragedy in order to heighten the plot have brought their heroes to an untimely end when they have died quietly many years before in their beds or as our chroniclers of daily occurrences put a duke to death give away an heiress in marriage or shoot off an admirals legs whenever they please mr addison while he was carrying on the spectator said he would kill sir roger de coverly that nobody else might murder him in like manner my dear cousin you may perhaps take it into your head to cut me off you may make an end of me by a cold caught in partridgeshooting or break my neck in a staghunt or you may rather choose to settle me perhaps with a rich old country dowager or press me into the army or clap me on board of a man of war but i desire that you will not get rid of me by any of these means but permit me to assure your readers that i am alive and merry and this is to let them know that i am in good health at this present writing  your papers i assure you have made a great noise in the country and the most intelligent among us read you with as much satisfaction as the evening posts or the weekly journals i know more than one squire who who takes them in constantly with the magazines and i was told by the postmaster of a certain town that they came down every week under cover to the butler of a member of parliament there is a club of country parsons who meet every saturday at a neighboring market town to be shaved and exchange sermons they have a subscription for books and pamphlets and the only periodical works ordered in by them are the connoisseur and the critical and monthly reviews i was lately introduced to this society when the conversation happened to turn upon mr town a young curate just come from oxford said he knew you very well at christ church and that you was a comical dog but a cantab declared no less positively that you was either a pensioner of trinity or a commoner of bennets people indeed are very much perplexed about the real author some affirm that you are a nobleman and others will have it that you are an actor some say you are a young lawyer some a parson and some an old woman  the subjects of your papers have often been wrested to various interpretations by our penetrating geniusses and you have hardly drawn a character that has not been fixed on one or other of the greatest personages in the nation i once heard a country justice express his wonder that you was not taken up and set in the pillory and i myself by some of my rural intelligence have brought upon you the resentment of several honest squires who long to horsewhip the scoundrel for putting them in print others again are quite at a loss how to pick out your meaning and in vain turn over their baileys dictionary for an explanation of several fashionable phrases which though they have enriched the townlanguage have not yet made their way into the dialect of the country many exquisite strokes of humor are also lost upon us on account of our distance from the scene of action and the wit which is very brisk and lively upon the spot loses much of its spirit in the carriage and sometimes wholly evaporates in the postbag  you moralists are very apt to flatter yourselves that you are doing a vast deal of good by your labors but whatever reformation you may have worked in town give me leave to tell you that you have sometimes done us harm in the country by the bare mention of the vices and follies now in vogue from your intelligence some of our most polite ladies have learned that it is highly genteel to have a route and some have copied the fashion so exactly as to play at cards on sundays your papers upon dress set all our belles at work in following the mode you no sooner took notice of the cocked hats but every hat in the parish was turned up behind and before and when you told us that the townbeauties went naked our rural damsels immediately began to throw off their clothes our gentlemen have been also taught by you all the new arts of betting and gaming and the only coffeehouse in one little town where the most topping inhabitants are used to meet to play at draughts and backgammon has from the great increase of gamesters who resort to it been elegantly christened by the name of whites  as to the small share which i myself have had in your work you may be sure every body here is hugely delighted with it at least you may be sure that i will say nothing to the contrary i have done my best to contribute to the entertainment of your readers and as the name of steel is not forgot in the spectator though addison has run away with almost all the honor i am in hopes that whenever the great mr town is mentioned they may possibly think at the same time on  your affectionate cousin and coadjutor village   after this account which my cousin has sent me of the reception i have met with in the country it will be proper to say something of my reception here in town i shall therefore consider myself in the threefold capacity of connoisseur critic and censorgeneral as a connoisseur in the confined sense of the word i must own i have met with several mortifications i have neither been made f r s nor even a member of the academy of bourdeaux or petersburgh they have left me out of the list of trustees to the british musaeum and his majesty of naples though he presented an account of the curiosities found in herculaneum to each of the universities never sent one to me i have not been celebrated in the philosophical transactions or in any of our magazines of arts and sciences nor have i been styled tresillustre or tresscavant in any of the foreign mercures or journals literaires once indeed i soothed myself in the vain thought of having been distinguished by the great swedish botanist linnaeus under the title of eruditissimus urbanus which i conceited to be the name of town latinized but to my great disappointment i afterward discovered that this was no other than the learned naturalist mr silvanus urban author of the gentlemans magazine this neglect of me as a connoisseur i can attribute to no other cause than to my not having made myself known by my musaeum or cabinet of curiosities and to say the truth i am not worth a farthing in antique coins nor have i so much as one single shell or butterfly all my complaints against the modern innovations of taste have been therefore disregarded and with concern i still see the villas of our citizens fantastically adorned with chinese palings and our streets encumbered with superb colonnades porticos gothic arches and venetian windows before the shops of our tradesmen  nor have i as a critic met with greater success or encouragement in my endeavors to reform the present taste in literature i expected to have the privilege of eating beef gratis every night at vauxhall for advising the gardenpoets to put a little meaning into their songs but though i was there several nights this summer i could not say with cassio of any of their productions this is a more exquisite song than the other i have not been able to write the operas out of the kingdom and though i have more than once showed my contempt for harlequin i am assured there are no less than three pantomimes to be brought on this season as i set myself up for supreme judge in theatrical matters i was in hopes that my lord chamberlain would at least appointed me his deputylicenser but he has not even consult me on any one new play i made no doubt but the managers would pay their court to me but they have not once sent for me to dinner and so far from having the freedom of the house i declare i have not had so much as a single order from any of the underactors  in my office of censorgeneral though i cannot boast of having overturned the cardtables at routs and assemblies or broke up the club at arthurs i can safely boast that i have routed the manyheaded monster at the disputant society at the robinhood and put to silence the great claremarket orator in a word i have labored to prevent the growth of vice and immorality and with as much effect as the justices at the quarter sessions for this reason i expected to have been put into commission and to have had the power of licensing all places of public diversion vested solely in my hands but as i find my merits have been hitherto overlooked i am determined to lay down my office and in my next number i shall take my final leave of the public when i shall give them an account or my correspondents together with a full and particular account of myself  preparing for the press and will be published with all convenient expedition  with a new translation of the mottos and a copious table of contents as in the first and

proper to close the undertaking in which they have been engaged for near three years past and among their general thanks to the indulgent readers of their papers they must include in a particular manner their acknowledgments to those who have been pleased to appear in them as writers they have therefore at the close of their work brought mr town and all his associates on the scene together like the dramatis personae at the end of the last act  our earliest and most frequent correspondent is only known to us by the initials g k and we are sorry that he will not put it in our power to mention his name which if we are not mistaken in our guess would reflect as much credit on our work as we are sure will redound to it from his contributions to him we are proud to own ourselves indebted for most part of no    and    for the letter signed goliath english in no    for a great part of no    and  0 and for the letters signed reginald fitzworm michael krawbidge moses orthodox and t vainall in no  0   0      and      the next in priority of time is a gentleman of cambridge who signed himself a b and we cannot but regret that he withdrew his assistance after having obliged us with the best part of the letters in no       and    and of the essays in no    and     the letters in no           and   0 came from various hands equally unknown to us the imitation of horace in no    was written as we are informed by a gentleman of oxford the ode to friendship in no     was sent to us by a gentleman of cambridge and from two other gentlemen of that university we received the letter signed w manly in no    and another signed b a in no  0   these unexpected marks of favor conferred on us by strangers demand our highest gratitude but we are no less happy in being able to boast of the assistance of some other gentlemen whom we are proud to call friends though we are not at liberty to introduce them to the acquaintance of our readers from a friend engaged in the law we had the first sketches and most striking passages in no          and  0  though it may be regretted by the public as well as ourselves that his leisure would not permit him to put the finishing hand to them from a friend a gentleman of the temple we received no         and     to a friend a member of trinity college cambridge we are indebted for the song in no    and the verses in no     0     and     the list of contributions from such capable friends would doubtless have been much larger had they been sooner let into the secret but as mr town like a great prince chose to appear incog in order to avoid the impertinence of others he did not even make himself known to those about his person till at last they themselves found him out through his disguise  there are still remaining two correspondents who must stand by themselves as they have wrote to us not in an assumed character but in propria persona the first is no less a personage than the great orator henly who obliged us with that truly original letter printed in no    the other who favored us with a letter no less original in no  0 we have reason to believe is a methodist teacher and a mechanic but we do not know either his name or his trade  we now come to the most important discovery of ourselves and to answer the oftenrepeated question of who is mr town it being the custom for periodical writers at the same time that they send the hawkers abroad with their last dying speech like the malefactors like them also to couple it with a confession the general method of unravelling this mystery is by declaring to whom the different signatures affixed to different papers are appropriated for ever since the days of the inimitable spectator it has been usual for a bold capital to stand like a sentry at the end of our essays to guard the author in secresy and it is commonly supposed that the writer who does not choose to put his name to his work has in this manner like the painters and statuaries of old at least set his mark but the authors of the connoisseur now confess that the several letters at first pitched upon to bring up the rear of their essays have been annexed to different papers at random and sometimes omitted on purpose to put the sagacious reader on a wrong scent it is particularly the interest of a writer who prints himself out week by week to remain unknown during the course of this piecemeal publication the best method therefore to prevent a discovery is to make the road to it as intricate as possible and instead of seeming to aim at keeping the reader entirely in the dark to hang out a kind of wandering light which only serves to lead him astray the desire of giving each writer his due according to the signatures has in the course of this undertaking often confused the curious in their inquiries soon after the publication of our first papers some ingenious gentlemen found out that t o w n being the letters that formed the name of town there were four authors each of whom sheltered himself under a particular letter but no paper ever appearing with an n affixed to it they were obliged to give up this notion but if they had been more able decypherers they would have made out that though t o w will not compose the name of town yet by a different arrangement of the letters it will form the word two which is the grand mystery of our signatures and couches under it the true and real number of the authors of the connoisseur  having thus declared mr town to consist of two separate individuals it will perhaps be expected that like two tradesmen who have agreed to dissolve their partnership we should exactly balance our accounts and assign to each his due parcel of the stock but our accounts are of so intricate a nature that it would be impossible for us to adjust them in that manner we have not only joined in the work taken altogether but almost every single paper is the joint product of both and as we have labored equally in erecting the fabric we cannot pretend that any one particular part is the sole workmanship of either an hint has perhaps been started by one of us improved by the other and still further heightened by an happy coalition of sentiment in both as fire is struck out by a mutual collision of flint and steel sometimes like stradas lovers conversing with the sympathetic needles we have written papers together at fifty miles distance from each other the first rough draught or loose minutes of an essay have often traveled in the stagecoach from town to country and from country to town and we have frequently waited for the postman whom we expected to bring us the precious remainder of a connoisseur with the same anxiety as we should wait for the half of a bank note without which the other half would be of no value these our joint labors it may easily be imagined would have soon broke off abruptly if either had been too fondly attached to his own little conceits or if we had conversed together with the jealousy of a rival or the complaisance of a formal acquaintance who smiles at every word that is said by his companion nor could this work have been so long carried on with so much cheerfulness and good humor on both sides if the two had not been as closely united as the two students whom the spectator mentions as recorded by a terrae filius at oxford to have had but one mind one purse one chamber and one hat  it has been often remarked that the reader is very desirous of picking up some little particulars concerning the author of the book which he is perusing to gratify this passion many literary anecdotes have been published and an account of their life character and behavior has been prefixed to the works of our most celebrated writers essayists are commonly expected to be their own biographers and perhaps our readers may require some further intelligence concerning the authors of the connoisseur but as they have all along appeared as a sort of sofias in literature they cannot now describe themselves any otherwise than as one and the same person and can only satisfy the curiosity of the public by giving a short account of that respectable personage mr town considering him as of the plural or rather according to the grecians of the dual number  mr town is a fair black middlesized very short man he wears his own hair and a perriwig he is about thirty years of age and not more than four and twenty he is a student of the law and a bachelor of physic he was bred at the university of oxford where having taken no less than three degrees he looks down on many learned professors his inferiors yet having been there but little longer than to take the first degree of bachelor of arts it has more than once happened that the censorgeneral of all england has been reprimanded by the censor of his college for neglecting to furnish the usual essay or in the collegiate phrase the theme of the week  this joint description of ourselves will we hope satisfy the reader without any further information for our own parts we cannot but be pleased with having raised this monument of our mutual friendship and esteem and if these essays shall continue to be read when they will no longer make their appearance as the fugitive pieces of the week we shall be happy in considering that we are mentioned at the same time we have all the while gone on as it were hand in hand together and white we are both employed in furnishing matter for the paper now before us we cannot help smiling at our thus making our exit together like the two kings of brentford smelling at one nosegay  two  the end of the second volume preparing for the press and will be published with all convenient expedition the third and fourth volumes of the connoisseur in twelves which will complete the work corrected and improved with a new translation of the mottos and a copious table of contents as in the first and second volumes already published
