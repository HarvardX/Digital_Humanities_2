entirely due to you as a most distinguished character the position i believe will stand uncontroverted that there is not another man so circumstanced in the three kingdoms on whom they would not sit awkward whatever consequences we derive from an effect the primary cause should neither be neglected nor forgotten immortal deeds i own have been achieved by the executive sinews of military veterans but an acquisition of empire or honors we rather owe to the wisdom of the minister than the mechanical prowess of the troops  the actions of your life previous to the affray in point have given you that rank in the annals of modern heroism which your generalship had it been fortunate in this instance could scarcely elevate  human policy however circumspect is subject to disasters and therefore we wonder not that this your last undertaking although truly meritorious and momentous has fatally miscarried but i am no mercenary sycophant and can therefore accost the great man with honest panegyric though success keep not equal pace with his merits be it my business therefore in this offering to proclaim  that wherever lyttleton the ii d failed it was neither from ignorance nor inattention but some overruling necessity   i have the vanity to imagine that these sheets will find their way to all those various places on the continent which having once known you will eagerly

paragraph appearing in the morning chronicle of tuesday july    opened the literary campaign in which the macaroni forces have so fatally suffered  that the public may not be misinformed by the news collectors of an affray and its consequences which happened at vauxhall last friday night the following is declared to be the truth of the whole  mrs hartley the celebrated actress being in company with others among whom was the rev mr bate and mr colman was put out of countenance by what she deemed the impudent looks of four or five gentlemen who purposely placed themselves directly opposite to her which obliged her to appeal to mr bate on the occasion who observing as she did arose and seated himself between her and these rudelooking gentlemen who taking offense at this got up one by one and reconnoitred him with all possible contempt telling him the said bate that he looked like a stout tightmade fellow and capable no doubt of bruising to which mr bate replied they were four impertinent puppies and could not be gentlemen for their behavior to mrs hartley etc this brought on a general dispute which was divided into three acts till at last a gentleman one captain crofts addressed himself to mr bate and asked him whether he meant any thing against him who was answered no however capt crofts perhaps imprudently made himself a principal with the rest and after much ill language had passed brought upon himself an expression of anger from mr bate that he would wring him by the nose addresses were then given very scurrilous language was received by mr bate afterward in the gardens a challenge was sent to him the next morning and an appointment made in the afternoon at the turks head coffeehouse strand where mr bate with a friend mr dawes waited with punctuality for near an hour when captain crofts in company with the honorable mr lyttleton came in a short recapitulation began between mr bate and capt crofts who were interrupted by mr lyttleton as second to the latter by desiring that a crisis should be made without words that mr bate should ask the captains pardon in the papers or name his weapon and go with him in half an hour mr bate in a very manly way refused begging pardon where no offense was given but after expatiating on the impropriety of his deciding the difference as a clergyman in a military manner waved a remembrance of his profession in defense of his honor and agreed to adjourn with captain crofts to such place as should be appointed by the seconds mr dawes for mr bate and mr lyttleton for the captain who after exerting every thing in their power to prevent any ill consequences reduced the causes of quarrel and defense to writing the better to understand what ground they were to stand upon as friends to the combatants mr bate being the whole time as impatient for decision as any man living who had conceived himself injured but just as mr lyttleton and mr dawes were going out to choose their pistols the hon mr fitzgerall broke in with apparent anger and demanded satisfaction of mr bate for his friend capt miles but mr lyttleton and mr bate remonstrated with him on the great inconsistency of giving that satisfaction when mr bate and capt crofts were then going out yet he insisted on his friends having satisfaction first to which capt crofts replied in a way that did him honor that he was highly offended at the mode of mr fitzgeralls calling on mr bate after they had agreed to go out on one and the same quarrel and said that he never understood that one man was bound to fight a whole company where the supposed offense was given in gross and not in particular mr fitzgerall however continued his anger saying that his friend could not wait and he was determined mr bate should not go out with capt crofts till his affair was settled from this circumstance mr lyttleton and mr dawes then thinking from the particulars they had heard on both sides a trifling acknowledgment that each was wrong would be best recommended it to the parties who with some difficulty complied and were made friends thus ended matters relative to capt crofts and with respect to mr fitzgerall he declared that had capt crofts mr bate and their seconds mr dawes and mr lyttleton gone out he would have prevented a duel by putting the former under an arrest the former matter being thus settled mr bate desired mr fitzgerall to introduce his friend who he alleged was injured he answered that it would be better without for that he was a hotheaded man and might come to blows without ceremony mr bate however insisted on seeing him observing that he could not receive any violence from him being conscious he had never offended him on being introduced he said unless mr bate would box him he would beat him in every public place he met him mr bate then said if he did he would defend himself for though he was capable of boxing he never chose to decide any differences that way but with those from whom he could have no other satisfaction still as capt miles triumphed in this refusal mr bate with very great reluctance consented to meet him on his own terms and accordingly a long room was fixed on and mr dawes and mr fitzgerall were to second the bruisers who immediately prepared themselves for battle in the presence of mr lyttleton mr fitzgerall and another at first the advantage seemed against mr bate but a fair setto for about twenty minutes convinced the company but particularly capt miles that mr bate though inferior in size was victorious who never received one blow that he felt capt miles was sent home in a coach with his face a perfect jelly and mr bate was invited to dine with the hon mr lyttleton on the morrow as a proof of the applause he highly merited a greater instance of true courage never appeared in man than in mr bate who according to the proverb etiam quos contra statuit equos placatosque demisit enforced the applause of his adversaries  in consequence of the foregoing imperfect account the following appeared in the morning post of friday july  0  to the editor of the morning post letter i sir i should hold it an insult to the world if this public appeal on a late dispute was grounded simply on injuries i had received individually society at large is however so far connected with it as to render it a matter of some importance a misrepresentation of facts cannot therefore be permitted without a manifest partiality to that indecorum my situation compelled me to correct  there will not be wanting those even amongst my own fraternity rigid enough to censure my conduct in a professional point of view however commendable it may appear to them in any other for these i have no other answer than  i was neither born a philosopher  nor bred a pharisee the candid however from similar feelings with my own will acknowledge that during the outrage i complain of the formalities of my profession might slumber without any glaring injustice to decency or religion  i mean no contempt to the natural laws of gallantry when waving their sanction i appeal to the more serious one of humanity where an helpless woman was wantonly and repeatedly insulted by a set of poltroons the most wretched and contemptible   the case being at vauxhall gardens on friday evening last i saw mrs hartley in company with mr hartley mr colman and mr tateham seated on a bench not very far distant from the orchestra having the pleasure of her acquaintance i joined the party and their conversation when we presently observed two gentlemen pass by and look at her in a manner not altogether genteel however as custom has in some measure ridiculously indulged our fine gentlemen in these familiarities en passant little or no notice was taken of it not satisfied with this indulgence these gentlemen presently returned with two or three others of a military appearance who all seated themselves at a table directly opposite to her and began an attack in form resolutely determined to stare her out of countenance situated in the middle of her company she bore this treatment for some minutes before she even complained to mr hartley of her distress imagining that their triumph was near complete he begged her to continue her seat till the conclusion of the cantata then singing after which we would all retire these gallant heroes however still continuing the siege she found herself under the disagreeable necessity of addressing her friends generally telling us  that the behavior of these gentlemen was so uncommonly rude she could bear it no longer on this i turned my head and discovered four of these pretty beings staring at her with that kind of petit maitre audacity which no language but the modern french can possibly describe and triumphing over those female distresses which their prowess had nobly occasioned  to be a silent spectator of such insolence would be tacitly to countenance it loudly therefore in order that they might hear it i observed to her that i begged she would not be distressed as i would prevent any future insult of that nature  in consequence of which i immediately placed myself on a seat directly between them and mrs hartley this was an intimation that their behavior was generally remarked and i expected to find it at least productive of the end intended instead of which i became now the subject of their loud horselaughs and wise remarks thus unpleasantly circumstanced i thought it better to face these desperadoes and therefore turned about and looked them in my turn full in the face in consequence of which some distortions of features i believe passed on both sides  mrs hartley during this latter transaction rose up and made for the walk observing which i followed her with the rest of the company first justly remarking as i quitted the scene  that they were four impertinent puppies a gentleman instantly followed me whom i afterward found to be capt crofts of burgoynes light dragoons and asked me  whether i addressed myself in that speech to him  to which i replied  certainly not as i did not recollect to have seen him in the party  not satisfied with this answer he again demanded  whether i called him a puppy  to which i rejoined as before adding however  that the only way to be perfectly convinced in this particular was to tell me whether he was one of the four or more who formed the party and then the application would come home for that i said and still persisted  the gentlemen who so meanly and scandalously distressed the lady with whom i was in company were four dirty impertinent puppies  after this answer capt crofts observed that i looked very big upon the occasion  surveyed me with a supercilious kind of air from head to foot and then remarked  you are indeed a good tight fellow and therefore mean to intimidate me i suppose because you are a boxer to this he received for reply  that boxing was by no means my plan however as he seemed determined not to be satisfied but continued to follow me if he spoke three more impertinent words to me i would wring his nose off his face  on this he demanded my name and address which was instantly given him i then drew off to my company imagining that the affair would at least stand peaceably over till the morrow  previous to our leaving the gardens which we intended to do immediately we were under the necessity of walking round in search of one of our company when at the further end of the walk we discovered our former assailants now made doubly formidable by a considerable augmentation  no sooner did we approach than they began a fresh attack with redoubled insolence interlarding their loud sallies of pleasantry with  twig the curate etc submitting to this as long as human nature could do at last i stopped short with a view of knocking down the first man that insulted me when capt crofts touched me on the shoulder called me by name and begged to speak another word with me which i complied with by going back with him he observed that he had forgotten my address which was the cause of this second application on that subject i immediately told him again no    cliffordsinn but desired that he would now make sure of it by getting pen and ink from one of the waiters and take it down which he did accordingly  during this transaction a little effeminate being whom i afterward found to be a mr fitzgerall came up to me dressed a la macaroni and impertinently asked me whether any man had not a right to look at a fine woman after getting over my first surprise at this wanton interference of a man who was not even present at the dispute i answered most certainly and that i despised the man who did not look at a fine woman however i begged leave to observe that there were two distinct ways of looking at her  with admiration and with unauthorized contempt  that the conduct i censured was strongly of the latter kind and on that i founded my opinion that the offenders were four dirty impertinent puppies on this he consequentially remarked that even he himself had been served thus when he looked at a fine woman to which i answered that i had not the least doubt but that he merited any observation which might be made to him on that head on this he greatly answered that he would knock the rascal down who dared to say so and nobly put his hand to his sword  this interesting conference was for the moment interrupted by capt crofts who observed that he supposed i was a clergyman receiving an answer in the affirmative he said perhaps then you will take the advantage of your profession and not give me the satisfaction i shall demand to which i replied that he never should find i availed myself of that to act in any manner derogatory from the character of the gentleman  mr fitzgerall now became abundantly pleasant on this discovery of my profession which i parried as well as i was able and in return began to hold up this creature of all creatures to public derision the dress hat and feather  miniature picture pendant at his snowwhite bosom and a variety of other delicate appendages to this man of fashion were naturally seized upon by me and set off to the best advantage  here however as the laugh grew warm against him i was attacked by a branspan new face another redhot hibernian who was scarcely intelligible his ignorance of our language i believe preserved me from that insolence which his savage countenance strongly menaced him however i soon cut short by observing that the affair could by no means concern him and that therefore he was an impertinent fellow for his pains  the company who assembled round us on this occasion being desirous of knowing the cause of the dispute i told it them in a few words and then appealed whether i had not done as much as could be expected of me even if wrong in the first instance by giving my name and address  and whether mr fitzgerall or any indifferent person had a right thus wantonly to interfere in a matter in which he was by no means concerned  so far sensible of the impropriety of his conduct he was generally hooted by the whole company and jostled into the middle of the gardens where i left him to lament his folly and immediately took coach and returned with mrs hartley etc to town    for a confirmation of these several particulars i beg leave to refer to the gentlemen above mentioned the very extraordinary consequences of this transaction you will receive in order to lay before your readers tomorrow  yours etc hen bate no    cliffordsinn july          the succeeding day saturday july    the following appeared in the same paper  to the editor of the morning post letter ii sir about two oclock in the morning my servant came to my bedside and awaked me in order to deliver the following laconic epistle which he said he had that instant received from a man who had the appearance of a waiter and was then in my chambers expecting an answer  copy sir whereas you insulted me last night in a manner not to be suffered by a man much less by a gentleman i am determined to have satisfaction and as boxing is the exercise you seem to pride yourself upon and the only one that i apprehend you will partake of with me this is to give you notice that if you will appoint your time and place i will meet you upon your own terms and if you do refuse to give me the satisfaction i require i will hunt you up and down london till i find you and will then pull your nose  spit in your face and pull your black coat off your back  a crofts  to the rev mr bate ma  though in expectation of some interview on the preceding nights fracas and perhaps a recapitulation of circumstances yet i must confess the style of this letter  the bearer  the time  and mode of its delivery staggered me not a little however i ordered my servant to tell the man who waited without   that having some little business to settle in the morning i must defer seeing the gentleman till two oclock in the afternoon at which time i would expect him  contemplation naturally arose with me in the morning when the impropriety of this intended meeting struck me having no friend on my part to be privy to any transaction that might succeed i resolved therefore to adjourn the ecclaircissement of this matter to a place less exceptionable than my own chambers and in the mean time prevail upon some friend to be present at the interview accordingly i wrote the following which i delivered to my servant with strict injunctions not to leave the chambers on any pretense whatever that if any gentleman of the name of crofts or any gentleman who said he came from mr crofts should call to deliver it to either of them  to captain crofts sir i was in hopes that a moments reflection would have convinced you of the general impropriety of that conduct last night i was under the necessity of remarking however from a letter the most extraordinary which i received in bed at near two oclock this morning by the hands i suppose of a waiter without any date or address i am sorry to find that you mean a justification of the measures of your associates and further insist upon satisfaction from me for my just censure of them  the unseasonable hour was the cause of your receiving a verbal answer  that i should be at home precisely at two oclock and expect you however upon more serious consideration i find myself under the necessity of begging you to meet me at the turks head coffeehouse in the strand that i may avail myself of a friends presence at our interview lest our conversation be misrepresented  i shall wait for you till four  violent measures are in every point of view disagreeable to me but when i wish to avoid them it cannot be expected that it should be done at the expense of my honor i heartily wish our meeting may be different from what your threats seem to denounce for you must take some pains to bring me to extremities however sensible that the cause i espouse was strictly a just one i am determined neither to be shaken from it by menaces nor intimidated by any of your most desperate resolutions  i am sir your most obedient servant h bate no    cliffordsinn saturday morning july          immediately upon this i repaired in search of and soon found mr tateham a gentleman who was present at the affray in the gardens and who readily accompanied me to dinner to the turks head coffeehouse in the strand on our arrival here i gave orders to the waiters that if any gentlemen inquired for me to show them to our room in the course of our dinner mr dawes a young gentleman of the law and a friend of mine hearing of the nature of the dispute and of my being there sent in his name and begged to attend me through it to this i willingly consented as mr tateham was under the necessity of going out of town that evening and i knew not at a certainty when the matter might be finally decided  not long after this capt crofts attended by his friend whom i afterward found to be the honorable mr lyttleton arrived who were immediately shown in after some customary civilities on each side capt crofts addressed me by observing  that he supposed i knew the nature of his visit  to which i answered  i certainly did if that letter which i had then in my hand was written by him and contained his sentiments  he rejoined in the affirmative to both on which i remarked that it was not possible then we could go out upon the terms he might require until he had put some of his threats in execution  mr lyttleton on this warmly interfered and observed  that this was not the time to recapitulate particulars the matter being simply reduced to one point which as capt crofts s friend he was deputed to ask me viz whether i chose to ask capt crofts s pardon in all the public papers for saying i would wring his nose off his face or go out with him in half an hour  to this peremptory demand i directly replied   that being sensible of no impropriety in this instance i should not make any concession at all nor did i think myself justified after the treatment i had received in capt crofts s letter to go out with him till he had executed one of his threats after which i would certainly attend him   mr lyttleton on this begged leave to reduce the substance of the question and answer to writing which was done by him and me in words nearly as above  after this he asked me  whether i was not now wrong in urging capt crofts to strike me as from his situation in a military capacity nothing but the life of one of us could atone for it  to this i answered  that having been in the army myself i was not to be informed of the etiquette thereof in this particular and was therefore apprized of the grounds on which i stood  on this mr lyttleton observed  that he must beg then i would go over to france lest the consequence might prove fatal to his friend  this new expedition however i begged leave to wave by informing him that sensible of the propriety of my conduct i would by no means leave england be the event what it would  here capt crofts interposed and said the matter might be settled without such an excursion for as a misrepresentation of my character had been the cause of his sending me the above letter and being now convinced that the reverse of the report was the fact he apologized for the error and acquainted me that he now looked upon me as a gentleman in every respect  immediately upon this i took him by the hand confessed his behavior to be manly and told him that as we could now go out as gentlemen i was ready to attend him according to his request  then turning to mr dawes begged he would provide a case of pistols and any other necessaries that might be wanting the ring in hyde park being proposed as the ground i objected to it for fear of interruption and therefore recommended to mr lyttleton and mr dawes our seconds to provide a more private place at the same time intimating a desire that we might have a gentleman of the faculty near us in case either of us should unfortunately stand in need of his assistance  here mr lyttleton observed that the afternoon was rather an unusual time for these matters and therefore urged it might stand over till sunday morning four oclock  to this i answered that the affair was disagreeable enough at present in every point of view to me and therefore i would not on any account suffer it to hang another night upon my mind this with mr dawess citing the case of lords townshend and bellamont to prove that it was not so very unusual as was represented produced an unanimous agreement that we should therefore instantly take a post coach and four with a surgeon drive down to richmondpark and there finally determine the whole difference  at the instant we were about to quit the room mr fitzgerall abruptly broke in upon us with his hat on and in the most insolent tone of voice demanded satisfaction of me in the name of his friend capt miles who was without in the coffeeroom waiting with the utmost impatience haying recovered from the surprise i answered that he came rather mal a propos as i was going out that moment to settle a point of honor with capt crofts which i hoped would rectify the whole matter  to this he replied that his friend insisted upon satisfaction first and therefore i should not go out with any other man until he had received it and that even after this there were three or four others who insisted upon the same  i now appealed to mr lyttleton and capt crofts to know in what manner i should act telling them i could fight but one at a time and therefore would be directed by them my second frequently interrupting with similar observations  i begged leave that mr fitzgerall would introduce his friend capt miles that i might see this man whom i was assured i could not have offended  he replied he could not do that as capt miles was so enraged against me that probably he might beat me i observed that i fancied myself in the company of gentlemen and even at the worst i could defend myself and therefore begged he might be introduced  he now informed me that capt miles only came to fight me my own way and therefore if i did not box him immediately he would knock me down wherever he saw me in public mr lyttleton capt crofts and mr dawes now interposed by observing that i had behaved in every respect like the gentleman that from my present conduct my character must have been totally misrepresented and therefore begged this matter might drop and capt crofts and i go out to settle our point  this however mr fitzgerall flatly refused but while i was in conversation with him mr lyttleton capt crofts and mr dawes consulted together and agreed that with my consent the affair between capt crofts and me might be adjusted if some concessions were made on either side to which i immediately assented if it could possibly be done consistent with my honor capt crofts therefore first declared that mrs hartley having been ungenteelly treated mr bate acted with great spirit and propriety in defending her to which i readily replied that point being granted i begged mr croftss pardon for any unguarded expression which arose from a misunderstanding on both sides  thus far being amicably settled we returned to the former subject and on capt croftss retiring captain miles was introduced addressing myself to him i acquainted him that i had never seen his face before and therefore was ignorant how i could offend him i therefore begged leave to ask him whether he was the person who took mr fitzgeralls part in vauxhallgardens to which he confusedly answered yes and he now came to take the part of his friend mr fitzgerall i told him that he would be disappointed of the satisfaction he intended himself for that i never boxed with a gentleman nor ever would but if he had a violent inclination to box and nothing would satisfy him without it i would send for two chairmen give them a guinea apiece and beat or be beaten by them  mr fitzgerall now said it did not signify talking any more about it for that if i did not fight him now capt miles was determined to beat me at vauxhall or any where he next saw me to which i answered i should be there every night next week and would certainly defend myself  here the congress broke up mess lyttleton fitzgerall and capt miles going out not willing they should enjoy any thing like the shadow of a triumph i run instantly after them into the street perhaps indeed imprudently and overtaking them on the pavement opposite catharinestreet i told the captain that rather than receive any public insults if he would fix an hour on monday morning and bring either of the gentlemen then with him i would meet him and give him the satisfaction he required i received no other answer than  damn ye now sir  not able to contain myself any longer i beckoned him into the passage of the spread eagle tavern where we went into the front dining room attended by our friends as before i again addressed him and begged he would not insist upon this porterlike business or that he would tell me how i had offended him intimating to him at the same time that i shrewdly suspected i could beat him not being able to pacify him with words we stripped and previous to the onset i addressed mr lyttleton to testify how disagreeable it was to me and if there could be a propriety in such an exercise which i much doubted begged it might be here observed on both sides these proper preliminaries being settled the captain received in about fifteen minutes the satisfaction he required not being able to discern a single ray of light by which to find his way home  three irish chairmen i have this instant learnt were hired to attend the meeting according to their own confession to mr english hosier in catharinestreet  to see their little tommy capt miles had fair play and if it came to a riot in the street that they might lend a friendly hand to carry the point of an infamous assassin  this ungentlemanlike business being however settled we all returned to the turks head except the unfortunate capt miles when my conduct was in general highly commended and mr lyttleton on his leaving us begged i would oblige him with my company to dinner the next day sunday  on their departure mr dawes and i began to collect together some circumstances which led us to suspect that this capt miles was an hired bruiser  his most amazingly confused address the manner in which his friends treated him and his new awkward vestments all conspired to convince us he was a madeup gentleman for the business determined however to act with caution in the investigation of the matter the next day when i dined with mr lyttleton i asked him in the drawing room apart whether he knew capt miles to which he answered with a shrug of the shoulders he did not not a word more on the subject passed the whole day though capt crofts and mr fitzgerall were of the party  on the monday morning i was informed that his vanquished friend capt miles was mr fitzgeralls own footman in consequence of this intelligence which was a confirmation of my own suspicions i sent the following note to mr lyttleton  copy cliffordsinn monday july         mr bates compliments to the honorable mr lyttleton and requests he would favor him with the address of mr fitzgerall  every thing having been settled of the late fracas to mr bates entire satisfaction except the affair of mr fitzgeralls friend the boxing capt miles he wishes to have that single point which appears at present mysterious cleared up to complete the general ecclaircissement  to the hon tho lyttleton gerrardstreet  to this i could get no answer till tuesday which was then but a verbal one with his compliments and that mr fitzgerall was to be found always at dinner at the cocoatree  i now immediately wrote and sent the following  copy cliffordsinn tuesday july         mr bates compliments to mr fitzgerall and having a small matter of business to settle with his friend capt miles requests the favor of his address or the name of the place at which he is most likely to be met with  to  fitzgerrall esquire cocoatree pall mall  from sending repeatedly after him i received the following concise message at twelve oclock at night that there was no answer  on the wednesday i therefore wrote thus to him  copy cliffordsinn wednesday mr bates compliments to mr fitzgerall and is sorry to inform him that the message he has received in answer to his note gives him strong reason to apprehend that there are some grounds for the report that his friend capt miles was no other than his own footman however not willing to condemn him without the fullest conviction he gives him by this intimation an opportunity of confirming the truth or falsity of such report  to  fitzgerrall esquire cocoatree pall mall  to this i have not been able to procure the least answer whatever even to the present hour   this is a strict and nearly literal recapitulation of the various occurences which have attended this dispute and is now presented to the public for their conclusions from the tenor of the whole i hope it will be at least observable that wherever i erred it was from judgment only and not from principle the reader will discover that i have been particularly attentive to the darkest hero of the piece whose principal shades have ever owed their height of coloring to the distresses he could force upon an individual or his daring outrages on society at large this intimation will therefore be sufficient to prevent the public interposition should such a wretch be severely cudgelled by the man he has now so grossly insulted who means only by so friendly an act to prevent his making a more general atonement at the hands of a common executioner  i am sir yours etc h bate no    cliffordsinn july  0       in consequence of an unseasonable visit from mr fitzgerall to mr bate at his chambers on sunday morning the following was published in mondays morning post  letter iii to  fitzgerall esquire sir the honor of your visit to me this morning at one oclock was of so singular a nature that a public acknowledgement of it cannot be chargeable with any violent impropriety  it will save us both an infinity of trouble the curious will be informed of the circumstances on both sides without the tedious formalities of separate narrations   in the late infamous affray from whence i derived the melancholy consequence of your acquaintance it is i believe generally understood that i acquitted myself with a tolerable degree of prudence and fortitude the voice of candor has therefore upon that event prescribed a solemn distance between us for ever you will perhaps think it too rigid since it will now scarce permit me to look down upon or lament the situation of a wretch since that wretch is the wanton selfcreated outcast of society yet premeditated villainy must not go unpunished however dark and secret his footsteps i will industriously trace the monster till public atonement be made or he hide his savage head eternally in oblivion  i would fain attribute your dark attempt of last night or rather this morning to those bacchanalian sallies which have regularly preceded you to the chair of infamy but it savours too much of deliberate villainy to be less than the machination of some demon of revenge  i own my situation was somewhat unpleasant when four armed gentlemen attended by two others came to my chambers in the dead of night knocked up my servant and endeavored under a feigned voice and other specious pretenses to allure me from my bed the instant i had entered amongst you in the dark i doubt not but your triumph had been complete the summons of a known poltroon i never obey and therefore i escaped for mr fitzgerall i believe was the only one who had even a pretense for speaking with me i honor the impudence of that man who knowing he has too far degraded himself below the dignity of a gentleman ever to be seen in that light again now talks of nothing but bullets and bagshot before my knowledge of your friend captain miles you could tamely submit to be called an impertinent meddling puppy in the midst of vauxhall gardens a phrase that would have called forth the resentment of a grocers apprentice but when you and the world are informed of the mode of chastisement i have laid out for you and which is the only one i can now condescend to bestow upon you we hear of nothing but slugs in a sawpit  think not young gentleman that the humors of last night however often repeated will shake me from my resolve i have zeal in some instances which may surmount the resolution of an assassin should you continue to watch each pale moon to her chambers of retirement through the circling year and then steal out when darkness reigns propitious to your design still as long as i can escape the stiletto the ruffian shall be dragged forth however reluctant to public view where as his designs were dark and horrid his punishment shall be proportionably ignominious  i am sir yours etc h bate cliffords inn sunday noon aug         the day after tuesday aug   the following was published in the gazetteer  letter iv to the rev mr henry bate sir the unwarrantable freedom you have taken with my character in your narrative of the vauxhall transactions and the little regard you have paid to truth and candor constrain me to lay before the public a true and impartial account of that affair so far as i had any concerns in it directly or indirectly nor can i entertain the least doubt but that upon a fair hearing my conduct from the beginning to the end will bear the common sterling stamp of the gentleman the man of honor and if rightly considered by mr bate himself the real friend  to begin then my justification even you yourself mr bate will do me the justice to acknowledge i was not present when the pretended rudeness you so much complain of was offered to mrs hartley in fact i was in another part of the gardens but the rumor being instantaneously spread over the whole place that capt crofts had been insulted with the grossest abuse and foulest language by a gentleman then unknown i own sir i made what expedition i could to find my friend in order if possible to prevent any fatal consequences when i found capt crofts sir you was in conference with him words had run very high between you both and the cause of all this fracas it seems was that mrs hartley had been looked at in a manner as you say not altogether genteel this being the ground of the quarrel i thought there was room to qualify the supposed affront that had unintentionally been given to this lady and i observed that certainly every man had a right to look at a fine woman i flattered myself that by giving mrs hartley that epithet which so justly is her due i should receive at least a decent if not a polite answer more especially as i declared to you that i only came to mediate the affair sir i am now appealing to the tribunal of the public and upon my honor i solemnly declare i had no other intentions when i accosted you but to mediate the affair between capt crofts and you the one i knew to be a gentleman the other by his dress appeared to be so and i was in hopes of reconciling you both but sir what opinion must the public have of your veracity in telling your own tale when instead of thanking or at least meeting me half way in my endeavors to mediate you abruptly answered in these very words  damn you for your mediation you are an impertinent puppy for your pains this answer of yours sir you have not only jesuitically withheld from the public but you are pleased to tell them another story and add that on this i greatly answered i would knock the rascal down who dared to say so and nobly put my hand to my sword sir you know in your own conscience i never mentioned the word rascal nor did i tell you that i would knock any man down who dared to say so nature sir has not cast me in an athletic mould nor has the science of bruising had any share in my gymnastic education it is true indeed when you gave me the ungentlemanlike answer i have mentioned above i observed to you that you had no sword but that you might easily borrow one and that we had better retire than make any noise in so public a place i declare sir upon my honor that at the time i gave you this whisper in the ear i was an utter stranger to your profession nor from your preceding behavior could i possibly divine that you were in holy orders much less could i dream of any such thing by the answer you gave me which was that you did not choose to encounter me that way but that if i had a mind to try my skill at bruising you was entirely at my service thus sir stood the demele i had with you when capt crofts gave me to understand that you was a parson upon this ecclaircissement you are pleased to say that i became abundantly pleasant and witty upon your ecclesiastical character the real truth is and i will not disguise it i replied that i was ashamed of your behavior and that you ought to have your gown publicly stripped from off your shoulders and from that moment i determined sir even though your conduct toward me had been a thousand times more reprehensible than it really was and though you had sworn a thousand more oaths than i am sorry to say you did i determined within my own mind to pay every possible respect to your cloth and treat you as a man who if not out of his senses was at least within the sacred pale and protection of the church for sir i had a character at stake which i might have endangered had i applied either my sword or my cane knowing you to be a clergyman but sir notwithstanding the lenity and prudence i manifested on this occasion i cannot help repeating that i think you deserve to have your cassock pulled over your ears i may however be erroneous in my judgment as no person is a proper judge in his own cause but if you think my judgment in the wrong sir i am very willing to submit the censure i thus pass upon your public conduct to the decision and final adjudication of your own diocesan who i understand is the bishop of london and whom all the world must allow to be a competent arbitrator  georob fitzgerall   the succeeding day this answer came out in the morning post  letter v to georobert fitzgerall esquire sir when villainy has wrought the human mind to a certain degree of deformity the phenomenon attracting our admiration may influence the weakest of our passions  having confessed the originality of your character and even now astonished at such a wonderwork of providence considering the frailty of human nature i wish our dealings hereafter to be as limited as possible i own that you have betrayed me into a weakness by forcing me for a moment to dispute the rectitude of the universal system but doubtless the same extensive wisdom who gave being to the bloodenveloped housebreaker and assassinating footpad found it necessary in his mysterious operations to create a being in whom should center the deformities of both the man impatient of violent injuries may here be rather innocently led to arraign the divine justice but i am thankful that reflection has weight enough with me to banish such melancholy ideas and rejoice from thence to find that a sacred ne plus is assigned even to the most refined degeneracy if we could ever be led to doubt the position your letter of this day must convince us  that the vicious ignorance of the darkest profligate betrays itself in language and that his vices are therefore seldom or never contagious but from a personal intercourse  being now in no danger of becoming a convert to the creed of libertinism and treachery from the impotence of those arguments dealt out for their support by niggard nature a distant correspondence of this kind i will never refuse you if such condescension can at all amuse in this your disgraceful state of exile from society i have that christian charity which will not let me withold it from you  forlorn and wretched as you really are i will give you a temporary relief from the pangs of selfconviction by enticing your feeble talents ever and anon into their diminutive kind of exertion  dragged forth with horrible reluctance ten days being elapsed you make a miserable entrance in this days gazetteer and after the example of every selfconvicted culprit unwilling to plead guilty you make a contemptible appeal to the public in the nature of a defense generously giving you credit for its masterly formation i apprehend the whole burden of it to be strictly this  that your interposition was that of a mediator  that i damned you for your mediation and called you an impertinent puppy for your pains  that you told me i had no sword on but that i might borrow one  and that i replied i did not choose to engage you that way but that if you had a mind to try your skill at bruising i was entirely at your service   unfortunately for you my gentle paris not a shadow of truth rests on either of these assertions except that indeed of your being  an impertinent puppy for your pains which i acknowledged in my letter of yesterday to have said to you nor need you therefore have taken such an infinity of pains to enforce what is already so strongly impressed on my mind and on that of the public  rescued from the danger as a naked man i cannot now but laugh at your savage notions of a mediator  but my wonder ceases when i recollect to have read of two gentlemen going out to fight one of whom was shot through the head by a mediatorial friend in order to prevent the consequence of a triumph on either side  i fancy capt crofts cannot but recollect the mode of your first address and therefore i will not enforce the evidence of my friends till that gentleman or some other will step forth in public and bear you witness as far as respects the sword business it is entirely either the effect of a phrensied and distempered brain or the paltry forged evasion of an equivocating reptile to one and the same cause must i assign the origin of the bruising since i repeatedly and studiously told you all that was never my plan nay had it been  what could tempt me to it when mr fitzgerall was the tiny object of my resentment i appeal to your friend capt crofts whether i did not repeatedly disown such a mode to him and if i waved it here where some triumph might have been the consequence how could i condescend to think of such an operation when your little presence of aerial divinity courted my thoughts from manhood to a silent contemplation of the progressive beauties of the pigmy system  no my dear little whimseyformed being let no such rude forebodings disturb thy pretty peace in future terrific as my strides appear to such silphs and silphids i have long forgotten that schoolboy pleasure of breaking butterflies on the wheel nor would i now crush a noxious reptile had it not attempted to sting the foot that meant not to disturb it  i cannot take leave of you without acknowledging your political merit in referring the nature of our dispute to the arbitration of the bishop of london i will not accuse you with the thought notwithstanding its excellence  candid as it may appear i must however decline it though no man esteems this illustrious prelate more than i do i know his worth as a man his excellence as a christian yet his decree must be in some respect opposite to the feelings of humanity you know not perhaps the motto of the reverend bench  if a man smite thee on the right cheek turn unto him thy left also this i own is an excellent system accompanied with lawn sleeves these pious appendages have a soporific quality depriving the wearers of any other than a theorical knowledge of it however point me not out to their lordships as an heretic in this instance for i have no objection to fall into their notions upon similar terms   the fiery taper of youth will naturally burn less and less glaring as time with frigid hand shall call forth his hoary emblems on our head the mitre then adorns the reverend brow the holy crosier guards its single priest from violence  in this calm standstill of life the hour may come when i shall wish for such sacred protections and without an abundance of miracles time might vouchsafe to work me to the sacred purpose  then being free from the wanton attacks of libertinism my rightreverend feelings would be reduced to a narrow and peaceable compass  then could i perhaps declaim in favor of that nonresistance which my youthful impetuosity pointed out as no virtue and even being smitten by mr fitzgerall on the right cheek might from a fortitude truly religious  turn unto him my left also  i am sir yours etc henry bate cliffordsinn aug         mr fitzgeralls letter to the rev mr henry bate concluded in thursdays gazetteer august    letter vi to the rev mr henry bate sir the letter i addressed to you sir in mondays gazetteer i flatter myself has fully convinced the impartial public my conduct throughout this transaction has been that of the gentleman and the man of honor of the gentleman by my treating you as such so long as i took you to be a layman of the man of honor by ceasing to demand satisfaction the very moment i knew you to be in holy orders it now remains that i convince the same impartial public that i also acted to you as a real friend i say real friend sir because if i see a clergyman of the church of england scandalously exposing himself in public and can possibly make him feel his folly so as to prevent a return of a similar paroxysm i think sir even in your own opinion i must be allowed to be doing that clergyman an act of real friendship if you grant me this position then my reply is nathan thou art the man for i appeal to the whole company who were that night at vauxhall whether they did not deem you as a man lost to all sense of public shame public character and public decorum  desperate as your disorder was i did not despair to cure it the only doubt with me was the modus curandi  to have consigned you over to lord mansfields tipstaff might possibly have had a temporary effect but it would not have gone to the root of the disorder and a relapse in such a calenture as yours seemed to me to be death unavoidable  on the other hand had i taken this matter up seriously had i attempted to convince you that the fate of nations is not nowadays decided by bodily strength or muscular adroitness but by the fusil bayonet and cannon and that consequently in a political point of view the science of bruising so far as it relates to gentlemen who are born to command fleets and armies can be of no service and therefore contemned by them as a thing of no value nay had i even acknowledged that i approved of this bruising science when confined to the lower class of people because i think the national habits of vulgar courage ought never to be checked i say sir had i attempted to have reasoned with you in this manner i should only have added fuel to fire the only method then i could make use of with any hopes of success was to hold up to you the mirror of ridicule not doubting but that i should find with the poet horace ridiculum aeri fortius ac melius magnas plerumque secat res   on this plan sir i will not conceal from you that my first intention was to have borrowed one of footes wooden heroes strip him stark naked put him in a true broughtonian attitude and have told you that he insisted upon your fighting him it was objected that you must certainly see through the game that was going to be played upon you i was indeed of a different opinion and i observed that if the knight of la manch who in every respect that of frantic courage excepted was an excellent scholar and an accomplished gentleman could seriously encounter a windmill or a barbers basin your disorder being similar to his you would easily fall into a similar deception specie recti  however sir to comply with my friends i suffered my opinion to be overruled yet unwilling to leave you uncured i dressed one of my servants introduced you to him as a person you greatly affronted and a pitched battle ensued between you both to the great diversion of the few byestanders who were privy to the secret which has been pompously recorded by your own pen in the morning post but there is one little circumstance which out of charity i now tell you and that is i gave my servant strict orders not to beat you unmercifully and when we thought he had given you a sufficient dose we not only interposed and parted you but we highly commended your bravery and made you believe that you had sealed up both the peepers of the redoubtable capt miles  the good intention i had in playing the risible farce upon you was that when you should come to the denouement of the plot you might see quasi in speculo into what an infinite number of absurdities embarrassments and vulgarisms your unclassical propensity for bruising must as a clergyman unavoidably betray you for a man not absolutely bereft of reason to see his error is to be half cured of it and i had flattered myself indeed that i had happily made this halfway progress and was determined to be an autoptical witness of the real fact with this intent i went last saturday to your chambers in cliffordsinn mr montague mr lyttleton and mr storer were so obliging as to accompany me it was nearly eleven oclock at night when i pleased myself with thinking that cool reason would have resumed her empire and that i should have found you preparing yourself for the next mornings function of your holy office and that consequently all rancour animosity and ill will was buried for ever in oblivion but sir how greatly were my hopes crestfallen when after gently knocking at your door i found it barricadoed against me though i repeatedly told you my name and the real purport of my visit in return for this my care and attention all the satisfaction i could obtain was to hear myself called an assassin with reiterated assurances from your own lips that the first time you should meet me either in the mall vauxhall ranelagh or the pantheon you would break every bone in my skin sir it is an easy matter to talk of breaking bones but if you are not incurably gone i now caution you not to attempt putting your menaces into execution for if i must be serious with you mr bate you ought to know that the gentleman who can respect the protection of your cloth to a certain degree will beyond that degree protect himself and i must further observe to you that if in the defense of my person any fatal consequence should happen either to you or myself the blame will now lie at the door of your diocesan and not at that of  your humble servant george robert fitzgerall   mr bates answer in the morning post of friday august    letter vii to georob fitzgerall esquire sir the thread of inconsistent villainy being this day reunited i have now before me the whole contemptible defense of the most daring yet ridiculous disturber of the public peace  it has been observed that my former letters soared too far above the narrow limits of your puny understanding i admit in part the propriety of the remark and therefore in this reply i shall studiously confine myself to that simplicity of language which is found the abler advocate in the cause of virtue  pardon me if here i breathe a digressive sigh for some noble and worthy personages who till the fatal conclusion of your letter had comforted themselves with a flattering idea that their kinsman was rather vicious from accident than from principle or fatal necessity the tears of penitence young man are a grateful and efficacious offering even to despairing friends winning them as it were by enchantment almost to our own terms of remission  but from your example we are taught not to wonder that a wanton and stubborn perseverance alarms the dignity of their fortitude and bids them renounce for ever the villain they could not reclaim   i have hitherto mr fitzgerall in this correspondence with you trifled with my own consequence rather pursuing the delusive flights of imagination than standing forth simply your accuser as the injured man however a just and public sacrifice can never be out of season and therefore i will now pin you down to that public stake of infamy from which the extravagance of your conduct will never let you rise behold me therefore literally a rigid accuser no longer wishing to trifle with the despondency of a criminal or the patience of the public his appointed judge  if shame will permit you to look up you may now see how truly formidable is an injured individual rationally collected and inspired with a strong but temperate fortitude the powerful staff ordained to support him  the public sir are impatient for the decision and therefore no hired evasions will longer avail you the following black indictment courts your dejected eyes and truly dismal is such a scroll which bears the stamp of unshaken authenticity   charges against george robert fitzgerall esquire i i have all along accused you and now more solemnly accuse you of being a wanton leader of the second attack against me in vauxhallgardens  of being an impertinent meddler in my dispute with capt crofts to whom i had previously given my name and address averring that the mode of your mediatorial interposition was audacious and presuming ii i accuse you of publicly sporting with my profession of putting your hand to your sword against me as a naked man without the least intimation at any time of your desiring satisfaction of me for the extorted ridicule you received from me in the gardens iii i accuse you of breaking into a it remains to be answered  how mr fitzgerall came to know of this place of meeting except from capt crofts or mr lyttleton as mr fitzgerall never called at mr bates chambers nor did even capt crofts and his second mr lyttleton know it was to be at the turkshead until the receipt of mr bates letter to capt crofts a few minutes before their arrival there private room the next morning in the most insolent manner just at that instant when capt crofts and i were going out to terminate our difference and ruffianlike prevented it by insisting that your friend capt miles should have satisfaction first iv i accuse you of introducing your own servant to me as a gentleman and an officer and of persisting in my boxing with this savage notwithstanding the interposition of mr lyttleton and capt crofts who repeatedly told you  that my character had been misconceived and that i had acted in every respect like the gentleman and man of honor v i accuse you likewise of hiring three other irish ruffians and planting them at the door of mr english the corner of catharinestreet in order to aid and assist in your infamous project should it be necessary to enforce it in the street vi i accuse you of totally misrepresenting the consequences of the boxing business since your friend was beat stoneblind in reality and i did not receive a single blow vii i accuse you of misrepresenting the time of your intended assassination at my chambers on the sunday morning it being more than a quarter after one oclock as can be testified if necessary by the affidavit of the porter of the inn  this dark catalogue of positive charges i solemnly lay at your door and defy your every exertion to remove them the fact on which they are grounded i shall conceive as admitted even by your own partisans who were present at the transactions except one or more of them step publicly forth and confute them i now leave you for the present despicable in the eyes of this vast metropolis and even condemned alas by the generous natives of your own kingdom whose notions of honor though sometimes too chimerical will not permit them even to rank with a countryman who harsh as it may sound stands convicted as an incendiary  a liar  and a poltroon  yours etc h bate cliffordsinn thursday aug    the following appeared in the gazetteer of monday august    letter viii to the rev mr bate by seeing this letter in the paper do not think i mean to continue a literary correspondence with you sir who thrive by scandal and live upon defamation i therefore declare that as this is the first so it shall be the last time i will publish any thing concerning the late affair at vauxhall i had indeed imagined that you and i sir had finally settled all our differences but as i find you have revived the subject by your letters in the morning post it is incumbent upon me to set the misinformed public right in some particulars which you have grossly falsified  you publicly call upon me to certify the truth of your having declined boxing during the whole course of your proceedings now sir i as publicly declare that so far from declining you long insisted upon it refusing me the satisfaction i required and calling upon me to put my threats into execution which you said you would resent with your fist and your fist only and it was in consequence of mr lyttletons assuring you that the issue of the affair must then of necessity be fatal that you condescended to wave your privilege and for the first time in your life put yourself upon the footing of a gentleman  again sir in your letter to mr fitzgerall you assert that i said mrs hartley having been ungenteelly treated mr bate acted with great spirit and propriety in defending her  this sir as i never thought i never said the concluding words that passed between us were as follows i confessed that you would have acted properly in protecting a lady who had in your company been publicly affronted but that i did not think mrs hartley came under that predicament and as to myself i neither intended nor offered her an insult in answer to which you replied i am sorry my passion forced improper words from me and i ask your pardon these sir were your words and as they were much attended to they must have been heard and remembered by every gentleman present i little thought the affair would have terminated thus amicably as i was far from imagining that there would have been any stop put to my determined resolution of chastising your insolence  now sir i take my leave of you advertising you that i have heard of your terrific threats and denunciations of revenge these i look upon as the ravings of a lunatic and the frantic workings of a distempered brain if however you have coolly concerted schemes of meditated vengeance i shall not sir appeal to the mediation of your diocesan or the interposition of justice fielding i sir am a soldier and look equally with an eye of contempt at the mischief of a monkey and the malice of a monk  w croftes richmond august    mr bates answer on tuesday august  0 in the morning post  letter ix to w croftes esquire sir as a man truly sensible of your situation i cannot but pity your misfortunes  you must at last i think discover the fatality of your league with an abandoned and despicable associate who will not let you now enjoy that retreat from an extravagant imprudence which your penitentials and my sympathy had happily wrought for you convicted himself  after the most candid and dispassionate hearing he seems divested of that savage kind of clemency which has dignified the robber and assassin who bear individually the vengeance of society rather than involve the partner of their guilt in the horrors of their punishment this was the etiquette of heroic villainy but now lost in the dastard refinements introduced by our modern fine gentlemen for mr fitzgerall has hauled you forth ere the conscious blush of guilt had lost its empire over your cheek insisting that you shall make a similar atonement with him and that on the same public and disgraceful scaffold  with what a becoming diffidence do you face the world mr croftes in this days gazetteer  your anticipations are so melancholy and well founded that i could as far as respects myself let them die away contemptibly with the jargon and nonsense of the day  we lament the distresses of the wretched culprit mariner who declares with aching heart that if he weathers but the perils of his present voyage he never will tempt the watery main again  yet society has its sacred claims on culprits of every denomination on that account though you studiously wish to preclude my reply i cannot let you fall a slow and miserable sacrifice to your own wretched feelings and falsehoods when one friendly crush may annihilate you for ever  after a lethargy of three tedious summer weeks you are roused from your somnolency and now attempt to invalidate a simple narration of facts which your silence and the public candor have solemnly confirmed however apparently insignificant its orbit that little fiery meteor fitzgerall has its influence i perceive on certain pliant bodies forcing the timid into that disgraceful service in which he himself has been so shamefully defeated the servile awe with which the whole petit maitre tribe look up to this gilded phantom of prowess is a justification of your prudence i jump with you in opinion that an experimentary insult on a peaceable clergyman who fights not but from necessity is less hazardous than even a difference in opinion with another whose valor is founded on this was one amongst others of mr lyttletons observations to me perhaps in terr at the turks head it seems not to tally however with an anecdote now circulating at stuarts in bondstreet where a case of pistols are said to be still hanging as disgraceful mementos of mr f  s forgetfulness  his having fought eleven duels and whose principal beauty arises from having lost the roof of his skull by a pistol shot   the world sir are already convinced of your folly and my circumspection  i will not therefore now dispute with you myself on the two facts the subject of your letters which you have so totally misrepresented the candid will be satisfied without it and even the incredulous shall be eased of any doubts and scruples about it by the public testimony of those gentlemen who were present at the discussion  i cannot however but remind you of this awkward introduction of yourself to the public  you acknowledge to stand forth on my appeal  now sir if my memory serves me the appeal was to prove that i observed to you repeatedly at vauxhall that boxing was by no means my plan and therefore if i refused to you where some honor might succeed a bruising conquest how could i in vauxhall observe think of such a mode with the tiny fitzgerall  your masterly reply admitting it true for the moment is that i insisted upon your putting the threats of your letter in execution etc etc the next day at the turks head coffeehouse this is a mode of advancing so truly hibernian that nothing but mr fitzgerall having a mechanical command of you could possibly have occasioned  i believe i have worked myself up into that philosophical contempt for complicated vice and folly to be able to hear any thing you can advance however false and atrocious without the least emotion since your own passive disposition and the wellconcerted interposition of an irish renegado and his attendant ruffians prevented the proof positive of my courage i will not sigh for a fresh opportunity of displaying it but rather be thankful that my honor has been preserved without the loss of blood on either side  you may now indulge yourself young man with paroxysms of rage and vengeance since neither my necessities nor vices are so pressing as seriously to demand my forfeit life  since i never mean to befriend that most abject of all beings who has not spirit enough to disengage himself from his miseries but cowardly courts anothers hand to drive him from existence  as a proof that i never vowed the least vengeance against you whatever i will even consent that all your anxieties shall cease in future  you shall be a man of gallantry  but it must only be in those politer regions where beaux plume themselves on distressing the fair sex  you shall be a man of honor  in that country where they ask a public and an ignominious acknowledgment of a supposed offender or his blood in half an hour and yet after that  blush not to make the first concession  you shall be a man of cool though resolute courage  where danger is happily precluded by the known interposition of some generous friends  you shall be a man of strict veracity  where after having been mean in one instance they get over it by honestly denying the fact in another  nay come back from richmond  for however offensive to colonel burgoyne you shall even be a soldier still  but it must be in that arduous service where forts and armies own your friend fitzgeralls hereditary government where they fight with scented quil popguns loaded with bleu mange  whose armor is composed of miniature pictures and chicken gloves  who escape the severities of a noxious climate by an artificial atmosphere of ambrosial essences  h bate cliffordsinn aug         the following occasional letters and squibs by different writers on the subject appeared in the course of the debate as here addressed and dated to the printer of the morning chronicle july    sir your paragraph respecting the late fray at vauxhall gardens diverted me more than any thing i have met with for some time surely it could not be as i have heard it whispered is it possible little coly could conceal himself under the ladys petticoats all the while i mean while the rugged parson like a mastiff bayed the pressing throng twas very good upon my word i admire colys policy he could not have got a better bully in the world than a priest their blows are weighty he knows that he has experienced them and lately too  was it not great plume thy feathers wench for who but thee could charm two sages from the solemn chair of sophistry and make them take the cudgel for the pen  well it is an ill wind that blows no one any good  the parson is to write a play  coly is to bring it out  the lady is to play a principal part in it  and the town is to be diverted with it as no doubt it will  good luck for the town  some comfort for our theatrical expectations  since there was never a better manager than coly  a better actress than the lady  or a sublimer poet than the parson  and i  but dont tell any body  i intend to write them a farce  and what do you think i mean to call it eh  perhaps you cannot guess and so i will tell you  the vauxhall fray or a peep through the pockethole  damned good is it not  dont you think twill take  if it dont the devil take the town i say  perhaps i may take it in my head to send it you in a day or two and if you dont like it i will give you leave to print it without my consent and take the copyright out of my hands in spite of my teeth  adieu yours peepomalico   to the printer of the morning chronicle aug   sir peepomalico is one of the greatest wits that has ever exhibited in your paper or indeed in any other it is pity but his courage was equal to his wit but where is the man that excels in all things  he was certainly a party in that entertaining fracas which he has immortalized by his pen and from his description of colys fear seems entirely to understand that sensation and its effects  the public must be delighted with his proposal to write a farce on the occasion i have no doubt it will be an admirable performance but a more suitable name might be found suppose it was to be called the sham captain threshd or the feather in disgrace  peepomalico knows what i mean by the feather  a fitter subject for a farce could never have been chosen for what can be imagined more truly laughable than to see five heroes all men of the sword  men whose very looks might strike terror  picking a quarrel with one poor parson and after having each of them challenged him and sworn if all his hairs were lives their great revenge had stomach for them all  what i say could be a worthier subject of dramatic ridicule than their hiring a footman and dressing him as a gentleman to stand their champion in this noble cause  the piece if peepomalico does justice to the story will have an excellence not often met with in such compositions it will convey some useful lessons  the macaroni tribe may learn from it that they should be cautious of hunting a prig lest they should happen to catch a tartar and that a man of spirit in a just cause is superior to a little army of bullies whether in livery or in lace  i am mr printer i assure you equally unknown to all the parties of this famous vauxhall affray but a much diverted spectator last friday evening and  your very humble servant q   to the printer of the morning chronicle aug   sir the public has been lately much obliged to the literary talents of a reverend gentleman for investigating a difference between himself and an other founded on a political cause they are now entertained with one something similar and equally as important to the world but formed on a voluptuous one for what sir can we style a party at vauxhall an intimate acquaintance with a lady in a public character and a display of knighterrantry in her defense but an offering to the shrine of pleasure our young clergy convinced of the ill effects of theological disputes are contriving some means to soften the austerity of religion sensible how disgustful subjects of that nature are become to this polite age they have changed the tedious disquisitions of the fathers to the more gentle topics of gallantry and honor it is true their intention is humane and charitable worthy the applause of the present rewarders of merit but methinks to please the generality of mankind the transition is rather too rapid though mr bate did not contemplate like harvey the calm delights of a garden he might have shunned the tumultuous reverse he might have enjoyed the social converse of a friend without making himself the partizan of a quarrel he could have noticed an insult to a lady without particularizing himself in an affair which her husband thought uninteresting perhaps he was impelled by a warmer motive and had a deeper sense of her distress than the other gentlemen present but still he should have considered the badge of his profession and stifled his resentment to some degree of stoicism the world is too apt to judge from such appearance that priests are juggling with their consciences that their own example shows the decency and ceremony of religion is nothing more than a cheat upon them great changes are brought about slowly and imperceptibly men of pleasure will admire the spirit of mr bate but those who are wont to approach a pulpit will reflect that the old precepts of obedience and humility are violated by the very hand and tongue that enforced them they will appeal to their own understandings and despise the man who attempts to pay so ill a tribute to their memories and by losing the good opinion of a few may fail of their salutary designs in general  these sir are my thoughts upon the subject which if you please you may communicate to the public that those who are engaged in mr bates laudable plan may avoid those indiscretions he has been guilty of and by a cunning working of the scene descend gradually to a new mode of religion may they retain the exalted courage of that gentleman but endeavor to improve on his conduct is the wish of  your constant reader veritas   for the morning chronicle to the reverend mr henry bate aug   sir i am sorry to see in your letter of today that you have allowed mr fitzgerall any degree of literary reputation i would not have any man pluck a single bayleaf that does not belong to him therefore i inform you that mr fitzgerall writes as well as fights by proxy his literary substitute is mr b  k attorney general to the gazetteer  i honor your spirit as a man equally with your abilities as a writer at the same time i cannot help informing you that your letters particularly the last are generally censured as too florid and declamatory this kind of dress is calculated to hide flaws and

these mighty three did boldly soberly agree to give affront which is not common unto the sweetest fairest woman for none possessed of manners sense to such a fair could give offense but macaronies are a sex which do philosophers perplex though all the priests of venus rites agree they are hermaphrodites therefore this beauty of the stage at once with spirit did engage these furious milky mawkish three and all who saw her do agree that had not bate  himself an host who dauntless wields the morning post bravely stepped forth to save her charms they all had fallen within her arms as sampson

bobby fitzgerall you have been after getting into the wrong box do you see now with this same clargyman for not satisfied with terrifying you with his bodily strength for a little peaceable nonsense and sweating at vauxhall he now is eternally lapping you with his damned great english goosequill  but i will give you a word of advice my honey be after stealing a march as soon as you can and since you may be a little puzzled to answer some of his damned logic which as a gentleman you need not be after understanding why do you see me get capt miles to swear himself an irish gentleman and hire over again paddy murphy teddy bughlin and murd oshochlin who waited in the street to get at the parsons coat to swear it is all a lie about their being hired and so you will get out of this damned nasty scrape  from yours to the bottom a milesian   for the morning post to mr fitzgerall a card an officer desires a simple answer to these questions whether mr fitzgeralls conduct is not too infamous for justification even upon his own grounds in his letter of yesterday  whether he would have been tempted to a defense but from the generous intimation of lord bristol and the harvey family who peremptorily refuse to see him in future except the principal of the accusation be proved erroneous  whether all the gentlemen at the cocoatree and st jamess coffeehouse have not on this occasion turned their backs upon him  whether he has invalidated a tittle of mr bates evidence on the contrary whether he does not still appear what he was termed by that spirited gentleman an impertinent meddling puppy and the whole of his after conduct savor much of the poltroon and assassin   to the editor of the morning post mr editor by inserting the following you will oblige a constant reader  to the rev henry bate sir in reading your ltter to mr fitzgerall on monday the  d of august i there find a phrase which i cannot altogether agree with you in you say to mr fitzgerall that he tamely submitted to be called an impertinent meddling puppy in the middle of vauxhallgardens a phrase that would have called forth the resentment of a grocers apprentice now sir as i have been an admirer of your conduct throughout the whole affray at vauxhall you will excuse me as being in trade of taking the present liberty as i imagine you address the public in general  therefore mr bate do you imagine that a grocers apprentice or any mechanical person has not the same passions the same spirit and the same resentment as you or any other person in a higher sphere of life and i must acquaint you sir that had you or any other gentleman used the former expression to me i should most certainly have used a proper and becoming spirit on the occasion now sir if in your next letter to the morning post you will allow that a mechanical person or grocers apprentice has the same feelings as you or any of those gentlemen concerned in the above affray you will make me still remain what i already am an admirer of your conduct   a grocers apprentice piccadilly tuesday evening seven oclock  for the morning post to the petit maitre a la macaroni sir if truth belies me not you are  an impertinent meddling puppy heaven forbid i should merit that reproachful epithet or stigma much less take courage to resent it though justly bestowed you will not be easy mr kickshaw till you get yourself into bad bread and what will you do then your premeditated malignant villainous and dastardly conduct must by no means pass off with impunity mr bate would be highly culpable as a duty he owes to himself and to society in permitting it his declared resentment the offspring of a just indignation must be put in force to make you remember how you wantonly abuse any society in future it is indispensibly necessary that your bacchanalian brethren may take warning by the parsons exemplary punishment  because you have a fortune you are licenced to do as you please and indulge your wanton and vicious disposition in every thing be it ever so wicked and opposite to the laws of god and man if these are your ideas and this your temper the sooner you are out of this world the better i wish reformation to you and your comrades but at the same time am sorry to say that when the branch of a young tree begins to bend it is a difficult matter for it to be streightened when it grows old  yours etc a layman cliffordsinn coffeehouse august    for the morning post friday aug   mr editor as the late altercations between the rev mr bate and some gentlemen of the laity at vauxhall have prepossessed the public to know who is the most censurable i cannot help as i happened to be a spectator giving an impartial and candid account so far as i saw and heard which was as follows viz  as mr and mrs hartley the rev mr bate with another gentleman or two were innocently enjoying themselves over a few vauxhall slices while their auricular faculties were ravished with the melodious strains from the orchestra suddenly a violent squall of some descendants of adam whose occupations might be in the manufactory of wigs for what i can tell as i never saw any of them before overset their tranquillity and entirely sunk for that night their pleasures to the bottom the mariners however exerted all their efforts to weather the storm which i am afraid they would not have accomplished had not mr bate plied his oar in so judicious a manner as fairly kept them above water though he rowed into the very nose of the squall but to be concise  those gentlemen the inconsistencies of whose behavior the rev mr bate so sensibly delineated in my opinion were highly reprehensible if some open remarks and long impertinent starings to discover the exact symmetry of every feature in mrs hartleys face in that situation are to be deemed so one of the macaroni antiloguists not quite six feet ten inches high but uncommonly full of garrulity with a look that would have intimidated a butterfly thus addressed mr bate  parson bate parson bate as you are a souldriver it would much redound to my dishonor to box you and as i believe you would thrash me were you to try i will not attempt it but you may be assured i shall procure one who will wallop you to your hearts content the first time he meets you by this request mr bate gave them directions where he was to be found and as to the result he has heartily laid it open to the public in this paper before it would therefore be necessary to quote it again  upon the whole i hope every impartial person will acquiesce with me that the rev mr bate acted the part of a man by heroically frustrating the designs of those that certainly attempted to break a very material part of the tenth commandment  an impartial spectator   to the editor of the morning post aug   sir mr bate having this day published a narrative of the affray at vauxhall the public therefore have a right to make their remarks on it i shall observe then that i dont in the least doubt the veracity of it in any one particular for these reasons first it is attested with his name and an appeal to the parties concerned secondly the signature wears the name of a man who has acted nobly in showing a nice sense of honor and a man of nice honor scorns a lie having so far premised what must we think of the military gentlemen in drawing up their brazen artillery to attack a woman and stare her out of countenance the answer is plain that for their rude behavior to our theatrical shore they are undeserving of the name of gentlemen in poorly daring to insult a woman mr bate like a dumont protected her and every man of honor must applaud him for the part he acted he was ready to give them either gentleman or ungentlemanlike satisfaction and to show there was a poetical justice in the conclusion of this piece the person who was himself no gentleman the boxing capt miles met with ungentlemanlike satisfaction i am only sorry that the servant received the wages which were so properly due to the master and that the master was beat by proxy but there is one point particularly wants clearing up and the worthy triumvirate are publicly called upon to answer these questions was not capt miles a counterfeit man of war and no soldier as brainworm says or in plain english was he not either mr fitzgeralls servant or a person employed to fight for him and the party did not capt crofts challenge mr bate at the coffeehouse to try his courage with an intent if he was found wanting therein to expose him as a coward and lastly was not the introducing of the supposed capt miles at the same time peremptorily insisting that mr bate should fight him first a scheme planned to secure a retreat to capt crofts if mr bate accepted his challenge should this be the case it is making courage as it were a game at brag and the captain was bragging with pam in hand for there was a knave secured in his favor being determined not to sleep with his forefathers but to sleep in a whole skin an answer therefore is necessary to remove a stigma which silence on this head will construe in the affirmative  yours an occasional writer ps i am an entire stranger to mr bate but will advise him as a clergyman against duelling in future though in my opinion when he is insulted he has a right to make use of those weapons which nature that is to say the god of nature has armed him with     to the editor of the morning post august   sir the conclusion of fitzgeralls reply having made its appearance in this days gazetteer i will venture to say that it is the weakest defense i ever saw and had a premium been offered for the most foolish production of the daily papers the gazetteer would have carried off the prize nem con to prove this what can be more weak and ridiculous than his tale about mr footes poppets or more infamous than that a man pardon the misnomer who bears a commission under the king should even bribe his footman to do that which he was afraid to do himself that is fight mr bate this was not only an affront to that gentleman by putting his footman on a level with him but to the army in general in equipping a man with military vestments cockade etc that was a disgrace to it and could be equalled in infamy only by his master but to return to mr footes poppets  though it is well known that mr foot does not love fighting himself i am of opinion he admires that spirit so much in others he would not even keep a poppet in his pay that would turn his back on mr fitzgerall whom for his pusillanimous behavior in this affair i shall characterise as a kind of mandrake tottering under the mighty load of a cockade like the poppy percharged with the morning dew i shall only say mr fitzgerall in both his letters seems very desirous of having the bishop of london for his second as well knowing that the sword pistol and hammer of death form no part of his lordships camp equipage and should mr bate make his appearance that he could squat entrenched behind his graces church bible but i am afraid he will meet with very little relief from this quarter  for his crime is of so atrocious a nature that it is not entitled to the benefit of clergy  scourge   for the morning post to the insignificant mr fitzgerall august   sir in the preamble to your defense you intimate that the impartial public will find that your conduct to mr bate in the late fracas has been not only that of a gentleman and man of honor but of a real friend now sir as i cannot trace the least glimpse of any one of those characters through your whole narrative i am apt to conceive some errata have been committed to the press  i have therefore taken the liberty to read for a gentleman  a noisy coxcomb for a man of honor  an assassin and for a real friend ob mon dieu a villain indeed master bobby you have discovered so infamous an heart that the philosophic eye cannot but drop a pitying tear for the depravity of human nature thanks to the rev clergyman for having put his mark upon you the unwary may now avoid you as a noxious reptile and the discerning despise you as an infamous scoundrel there is little doubt but the bastinado would be of service to you and as i have your amendment much at heart the first time you give me a gentlemanlike opportunity i will serve you as my grandfather did capt bobadil i will wait for no ecclarcissement of the matter a blow and a word is my motto  young downright st jamess coffeehouse  to the printer of the morning chronicle aug   sir since i have had a douse of the chops given me by a satirical rogue in your paper of last tuesday pray give me room while my blood is up to take a fair knock at him in return he shall have it d  n me in the true batenian style oh oh mr q in the corner you have taken it into your head to show your tail at last i have often heard of q in the corner and was always told it was an ugly thing with a long tail but you are a plaguey fool for showing your head and opening your mouth any body may see it is but a blockhead a mere mechanical wooden head and i dare say the first knock that i shall hit it twill sound like an empty pumpkin brainless and light  and so you are in the queue for writing eh have at you then and see if i dont set you upon your head  there take that  there is a cross buttock for you q i told you i could turn you topsyturvy in a minute what a contemptible figure you cut now  coly looked not worse when he peeped through the pocket hole nor the parson when he was poppd in the pond and pelted from the purlieus of prittlewell in essex you say you know him not that is another proof of your having a wooden head for who but a blockhead would have exposed his tail in defense of a superficial paragraphmaker one that has been scribbling these seven years in oblivion writing abuse for the sake of popularity and has often been about to hang himself that he never could extort an answer  without a blush he has addressed the muses too but they with indignation turned their backs apollo refused to beam one ray upon him and pegasus would have kicked his brains out for daring to ride had not hercules interfered and snatched him from despair advised him to lay down his pen take up his fist fix upon the first coward he could meet with and that way fight his way to fame and that way the parson has succeeded and so mr q you would advise me to change the title of my farce but when you know me better you will find me a man who never takes a fools advice i shall give it you under the title i have proposed the vauxhall fray or a peep through the pocket hole i am about the last scene and you shall have it forthwith till when i am yours  peepomalico   the following was seen in the morning post of the same day  a correspondent informs us that the hon mr littleton and mr fitzgerall are preparing for their travels the former going to make further discoveries if possible on the continent the latter returning for the benefit of his health to his native country and this in the st jamess chronicle of the same evening  it is supposed that the macaronies who occasioned the vauxhall squabble were deluded into that scrape by the notion that mr bate was a wonderful bruiser they should not otherwise have acted the cowardly part which their conduct discovers the loss of an eye or a foretooth or a bruise in the face is worse than death to a macaroni but in an excursion to bagshot or an adventure in a sawpit none are more ready for not one of the whole fraternity ever feared in a quarrel that you should blow out his brains to the editor of the morning post aug   sir mr fitzgerall being convicted yesterday on his own confession in the public papers of infamously employing his footman to fight mr bate under the disguise of a gentleman in the army mr lyttleton for i will not call him the honorable till this point is determined and capt crofts are publicly called upon to answer this question were they or were they not separately or collectively privy to the above disgraceful scheme it lies particularly on capt crofts to make a reply or it will confirm the opinion of the town that when he gave a challenge to mr bate he had taken care to secure his own person by providing a substitute to fight for him  their answer will enable the public to bestow on them their proper epithets and their silence deemed a testimony of their guilt  justitia   the same day these paragraphs appeared in the same  a correspondent informs us that the macaroni club have had a meeting on the piteous situation of their brother member mr fitzgerall and have unanimously resolved to advise that unfortunate petit maitre to appear only in petticoats at vauxhall for the remainder of the season as the most likely method of escaping the chastisement due for his late unmanly and senseless conduct the pretty creature  his snowwhite bosom decorated with the miniature resemblance of his own sweet person may then tread in perfect security the delightful walks of that enchanting spot in company with his equally gallant associates capt miles capt crofts and mr lyttleton etc a correspondent thinks it would not be entirely unnecessary to insert the following short sketch lest those who do not much resort to public places should be ignorant of the manly personage of mr fitzgerall he may be easily distinguished from the rest of the noble order by the following extraordinary piece of macaroniship sweet fitz wears two watches  sweet fitz has nine seals to each  heavens what could not such a sweet creature perform the paragraph beneath is taken from the london packet of the same evening  a correspondent says that capt crofts letter in yesterdays gazetteer breathes an air of harshness which the military are but too apt to assume in the room of candor and gentlemanlike civility when an officer talks or writes to a clergyman or indeed any man of a civil profession he should surely aim at a placid inoffensive style and forget the haughty language of a young ensign to a corporal in a garrison to tell a clergyman that his agreeing to fight a man with a cockade in his hat was the first instance of his gentlemanlike behavior is a very gross insult to the dignity of the cloth in general the clerical gown is supposed to be of itself an infallible token of the gentility of the person who wears it the bravado at the conclusion of the letter in the words i sir am a soldier and look equally with an eye of contempt at the mischief of a monkey and the malice of a monk is equally bobadilian and paradoxical does capt crofts mean his friend fitzgerall by the monkey since the papers have said he dresses so like one of those animals whose mischievous qualities he seems fully to possess it is evident that mr bate acts openly if he acts absurdly he has neither the malice of a monk nor the frigid caution which characterizes that order to the editor of the morning post sir by inserting the following letter you will very much oblige a constant reader  to georobert fitzgerall and william crofts esqrs gentlemen your behavior concerning the vauxhall affray has not only made you more contemptible in the eyes of the public than you really were before but has likewise shown a meanness in you which i think impossible to be paralleled you mr fitzgerall i principally address as having acted inconsistent both with the character of a soldier and a man of honor your behavior sir was more like that of an assassin than of a gentleman to come to a persons chambers at the dead of night armed and along with a set of ruffians who no doubt if you could have drawn mr bate from his bed with feigned pretenses were to have assisted you in your black purpose  your bringing your own footman in the habit of a military gentleman and imposing him as such upon mr bate under a feigned pretense that he was affronted by mr bate at vauxhall will that mr fitzgerall as you express in your letter bear the uniform stamp of the gentleman or the man of honor and if rightly considered by mr bate himself the real friend  no sir it will only bear the uniform stamp of a villain and in no other light can i look on the man who because he was afraid to vindicate the cause he had unjustly espoused brought his own footman to undergo the chastisement he himself so justly merited you mr crofts and mr lyttleton must have been acquainted with the whole it must have been a concerted scheme for after you found mr bate had spirit enough to give you the satisfaction you required you meanly while mr bate was engaged in a talk with mr fitz gerall and his friend captain miles only fit for each others company retired to a corner of the room and proposed making up the affair amicably how far different this behavior was to the letter you sent at two oclock in the morning i leave the public to the reference of the morning post for  neither could i was i mr bate have sat down tacitly and not have called you both to account both being privy to it although the former affair was amicably cancelled and how mr lyttleton could have the effrontery to ask mr bate home to dinner with him being sensible as he certainly must that he had acted to a man of honor with such impropriety is to me most astonishing  if mr fitzgerall or any of the gentlemen concerned can vindicate themselves against the above charges i shall be quite happy to find i have been mistaken in their real characters   w  piccadilly  for the public ledger to mr fitzgerall monday aug   sir you and your reverend adversary have appealed to the public as if they were interested in your disputes or as if a quarrel between two obscure individuals of little consequence to society and not very respectable was an event of importance to the whole human race  such vanity i can easily pardon but when it is accompanied with an impudent and avowed insult with a violation of that decency and respect which are due to the military i hold it deserving of the severest censure and since you have submitted your conduct to the tribunal of the public i shall examine it with great freedom but not i assure you without candor  as to the priest i shall leave him to contemplate the disgraceful consequences of an impertinent and officious interposition the husband of the woman who by the bye appears to have been too squeamish considering her station in life only was obligated to take cognizance of your rudeness and in his absence her two friends who accompanied her to vauxhall were the properest persons to chastise your insolence but priests in all ages and of every community have been distinguished and despised for their officiousness and the conduct of this reverend gentlemen affords me a sufficient reason why i should leave him to his reflections  your giving the rank of captain to your livery servant is the occasion of this letter and though you may possibly find an excuse for every other part of your behavior i am fully persuaded sir you will not be able to justify the liberty which you have taken with the gentlemen of the army upon this occasion  the military will not thank you for reducing them to a level with your domestic and after declaring that your respect for the church prevented your punishing your adversary it is somewhat extraordinary that the only instance you give of your respect for religion was the greatest indignity you could possibly offer to it this circumstance i protest is rather unlucky it is a certificate of your country but neither a proof of your courage nor humanity  how unfortunate it is that in almost every transaction you prove yourself a native of hibernia let us now sir proceed to particulars  you became engaged in a riot at vauxhall but not principally the parties who were immediately concerned agreed to meet and that meeting was at a coffeehouse while they attended by their seconds were settling the dispute your servant with an assumed name and rank demanded satisfaction for a pretended insult and upon this occasion you acted in your favorite character of a mediator by assuring the parson that capt miles was so passionate that if he was admitted he might beat him with uncommon fury i will pass over the indignity offered to the army and leave the military to correct your insolence they are very capable of doing it and i have no doubt but they will take notice of the favor you have done them i come now sir to consider you in the character of a gentleman when you officiously entered the room at the coffeehouse to inform mr bate that capt miles whom he had insulted was below did it not occur to you that you was guilty of a premeditated falsehood at all times unworthy of a gentleman and particularly in this instance and was it from that confusion of ideas so common to your countrymen that you blended the character of an officer with that of a bravo  shame upon such baseness by your letter of today you speak of gentlemen that are born to command fleets and armies  born to command fleets and armies good heavens  i presume sir you imagine the ranks of admiral and general are hereditary and that the son of either must succeed to the honors of the father though it is very possible this son might be an arrant coward and a consummate blockhead the fate of a nation so unfortunately circumstanced would be as precarious as if you was at the head of a fleet or army  a misfortune which i trust to god will never happen to us i have one more remark to make viz the impropriety of a drunken man going at one oclock in the morning to reason with his antagonist attended by three more the late hour and your different situations amount sir to a presumption that with this auxiliary aid you meant to accomplish what your servant was on trial found incapable of to me your intentions appear to have been hostile and the difficulty not to say impossibility of proving yourself a gentleman and a man of honor is manifest in the confusion and perplexity which appear throughout the whole of a laborious defense neither plausible nor free from grammatical errors as to capt crofts was i not assured he had been in the army i should have concluded by his letter to mr bate that he was the editor of the gazette or that a statute of bankruptcy had lately been issued against him and if he was in the secret as you assert he was of giving the title of captain to a bravo i shall yet doubt the reality of his military character  as to mr lyttleton out of respect to his venerable and virtuous father i shall remain silent i will not add to the anxiety of an aged and unhappy father already depressed with grief and sorrow for the vices of a dissipated son  alcibiades   for the morning post to mr foot august  0 sir you surely cannot suffer such indignity to be offered with impunity to your wooden bantlings  their creation caused you pleasure  and their first symptoms of animation were employed in begging for their papa  their legitimacy never can be questioned who can doubt of their belonging to the timbertoe family  and now mr foot will you permit poor punch after the fatigues of his campaign to be pulled from his dormitory and exposed to the fury of the church militant st patricks cross now mocks the air with idle state and not jerusalem but the haymarket is to be the scene of holy confusion and pious murder i reflect that similar contests have heretofore shook the thrones of asiatick princes  rely not on the strength of man  the valor of gigantick might  or the light troops of the immortal bays even though they were led on by the redoubted capt crofts  reject the shilelah alliance unworthy of your english oak and adhere to those truly machiavalian principles of sound politics  no money to be returned after the curtain is drawn up  nor any person upon any account to be admitted behind the scenes  beware sir nothing however extraordinary is impossible to a man of mr lyttletons abilities if he gains entrance be not surprised at finding piety in pattens with a p  x and punch with a bloody nose  reflect on the personages who have dared to sport with your family  mr l  n the disgrace of english nobility the foetid sink of vice purveys for the debauches of this select set  mr fitzgerall that essence of nothing  that expatriated wasp  has already been depicted by captain doctor bate  and poor bubble crofts who lugged into the company for the sake of his   000 l note and into the quarrel for his captainship narrowly escaped the sire in procuring a chestnut for the amiable mr lyttleton  such a triplet can you tell where to meet on this side hell such is the respectable triumvirate which after proclaiming open war with decency and setting all morality at defiance attacks your innocent family and resolves on the pollution and contusion beyond the skill of the most able carpenter of your harmless defenseless mr bate  i have just learned that in case you preserve neutrality the junto have for want of puppets hired blockheads and engaged the captains obyrne and ofagan two gentlemen of approved courage and abilities as succedaneums for mr punch and bob the butler  and mr fitzgerall has bespoke another pair of cestused pair of vauxhall gloves for their armament   amateur de marrionettes cocoatree   to the editor of the morning post sir i am one of that impartial public who so heartily concur in applauding mr bate for the great spirit and propriety with which he has conducted himself toward those insolent macaronics who dared to offend him in the face of the world in a manner so diametrically opposite to every sentiment of honor and honesty it is not my present purpose to canvass this matter the investigation it has already gone through sufficiently evinces mr bate to be really the gentleman and the man of honor and that his greatest misfortune has been having to do with persons so totally devoid of every quality requisite to the constituting either of those characters  nothing remains to be said on this subject that can increase mr bates merit or the infamy and disgrace of his opponents i defy either his or any other pen to add to that universal odium which they have so effectually procured to themselves and therefore i hope and doubt not mr bate will treat the letter addressed to him in a paper of this day by mr croftes with that silent contempt so justly due to it   for where no honors to be gained  it is thrown away by being maintained and as to punishing these myrmidons a name sufficiently applicable considering the very seasonable visit paid mr b  by them with words it is not possible we must of necessity conclude them long since lost to every feeling of humanity or they never could with that unparalleled effrontery have made a public avowal of the scandalous and unwarrantable imposture put upon mr bate at the turkshead coffeehouse for which however it seems he has an argument in store that will convince the facetious gentleman who makes his boast of it of his error for boys and brutes are only taught by blows and i make no doubt but this doughty gentlemans back will be found upon the application of a cane to enjoy a more delicate sensation than his heart  i am sir your constant reader and a despiser of poltroons richmond coffeehouse monday night aug    the paragraphs following came forth in the morning chronicle of wednesday august     it is strongly reported that a friendship which will probably be of duration has commenced between a certain foppish knight now invested with an office of some consequence to the city of london and county of middlesex and the fribbling parsonfearing mr fitzgerall founded on a fellowfeeling for each other the knight is beyond conception rejoiced that there is in the creation as abject a coward as himself has therefore communicated to mr f his readiness to accompany the rev mr bate to tyburn in his public character if the said b should be convicted of maiming and defacing with an intention to kill before his shrievalty expires  now we see the denouement of the petit piece of vauxhall which had like to have turned out a deep tragedy if not to the great actress to the reverend sensible and spirited actor under her and to some of the spectators we surely cannot be at a loss to determine that the parson behaved well as a bruiser and defender of the fair but ill as a parson and lecturer of others as parsons like cobblers should not go beyond their last or text  for if coblerlike the parson will fight or get drunk worth makes the man and want of it the fellow the rest is all nothing but leather and prunella it is therefore hoped this will be a lesson to all parsons to stick to their texts and not ramble again to public places not even with gods or goddesses either of the stage pit or gallery  to the editor of the morning post to the officers of marchingregiments only gentlemen your answering the following questions impartially will oblige the public and it is hoped be of no prejudice to the respectable part of the army in which you serve  if any commissioned officer whatever belonging to any of his majestys marching regiments had been privy to and suffered any of his acquaintance to introduce a liveryservant under the title of gentleman and an officer to act as a bravo   would the gentlemen serving in the same corpse have done duty or ranked with him after such behavior  would they not have insisted on his being tried by a court martial for ungentlemanlike behavior  would not all of you if you knew the man and had been informed of his having acted as above have shunned and despised him and thought it a disgrace to be seen in his company  no soldier aug    for the morning post a card several gentlemen of the army present their compliments to capt crofts the soldier and request to know whether he really is one or not because they have heard that he was requested to leave the army for fear it should hurt his constitution but if that is as great a lie as his having any intention of fighting mr bate they now request he would resign as they are determined never to rank in the army with him in future  bobadil and co   to the editor of the morning post sir i have sent you a sketch as under of a late affair which if well executed would pay the artist for his trouble and meet with a ready sale i hope therefore the pencil will follow the traces of the pen that by

person as georgerobert fitzgerall  if you mean georgerobert fitzgerald who continued but a short time with us after his retreat from his apartments in the borough of southwark we have heard enough of him  yours etc no assassin   for the morning post a card mr bates compliments to the editor and begs leave through the channel of the morning post to inform the public whose patience he is afraid he

in yesterdays gazetteer  cliffordsinn thursday aug  0  the impatience of the public has been such that the publication of this pamphlet could not be retarded in order to wait for the testimony of the
