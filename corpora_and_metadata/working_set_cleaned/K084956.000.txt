submission most humbly dedicated by his obedient and faithful subject  robert pollard  address at a time when the arts find universal patronage and the enterprise of taste and spirit is drawn forth into works at once gratifying to the amateur and honorable to the nation producing them it is not easy for an active individual in the habits of professional research to content himself with merely admiring  he feels a wish to emulate and naturally adopts those means which best accord with his inclination or ability the proprietor of the present undertaking seeks to contribute his effort toward the further advancement of the graphic art and on that ground respectfully solicits the attention of the public to a field of emulation which hitherto has remained unexplored he aims to commemorate the actions of the renowned ancestors of our nobility and to trace them through those dignified scenes of glorious achievement which at once gained for themselves and successors the particular distinction of their sovereign and secured to their country the dearest rights and privileges it enjoys to those great characters are their countrymen indebted for the blessings of a valuable constitution and to their memories should be directed the highest tribute of reverence and admiration  the publisher of this work is fully persuaded that in point of general importance historical subjects founded on national fact claim preeminence over all others and he likewise knows that the most interesting events of a kingdom are chiefly to be looked for in the annals of its nobility he flatters himself therefore that his design at least will be approved and is only anxious to acquit himself with satisfaction in the arduous task of collecting arranging and executing in the choice of subjects for engraving every attention will be paid to those most important interesting and honorable the services of the soldier the seaman the ambassador the churchman and the senator will form the source of historic composition  the statesman and the lawgiver that of portraiture  and correct views and delineations of the venerable castle or monument which has been the scene or record of a remarkable event will with other apposite embellishments further illustrate the biographic narration  to the literary part of the work equal attention will be paid  nothing short of authenticity will be adopted whether in the necessary supply of compiled materials or in the original communications which the publisher is already possessed of and hopes to be honored with from the nobility or the curious in research and the whole is intended to be thrown into a form as elegant copious and comprehensive as possible in the arrangement of the peerage an alphabetical mode will be adopted but with due observance of precedence in the different orders of nobility  thus will the work in its progress take up a pleasing variety of ancient and modern subjects for the historical painter and when completed possess all the convenience of a biographical dictionary  in every department of execution the publishers first aim is excellence from a conviction that it would be absurd to expect public patronage without it his subscribers may rest assured no artist will be employed who is not fully equal to the task and if a judgment corrected by several years study and experience in the art of engraving can further induce a repose of confidence he presumes the encouragers of the work will not be disappointed every thing tending to illustrate embellish or beautify the subject will be strictly and uniformly attended to and in short no exertion will be spared to form through the medium of the arts a complete elegant and interesting peerage of england scotland and ireland   the subjects intended for the second volume are now in the hands of the respective artists  preface to please the amateurs of the polite arts to gratify the lovers of biographic history to exhibit to the world the prowess of renowned ancestry and lastly to honor the brilliant achievements of our nobility is certainly a pursuit at once interesting pleasing and laudable  it is near three years since this work was first offered to public attention much of that time has been diligently appropriated to facilitate the undertaking and every possible exertion made to fulfill the engagement  that with confidence the proprietor might look up to its patrons for approbation and encouragement two years however had scarcely elapsed before it became necessary to remove some injurious prepossessions entertained of its being a work of adventure and that it was not his intention to proceed with the execution of it to confute this insinuation he was fortunately and happily prepared and to answer it with effect lost no time in silencing that rumor by immediately transmitting to the booksellers in london and to those of the principal cities and towns in england scotland and ireland specimens of ten historical engravings and as many elegant designs then executed as embellishments to the work together with other ocular and demonstrative proofs of the sincerity of his intentions had he been desirous of making the performance less correct and methodical it would have appeared earlier for much time has been spent in his personal attendance on those noble peers whose titles and history compose this first number flattering himself that in a work where the honor of their families is so materially concerned they would readily have acquiesced in affording their aid some were found of this description who with an amiable condescension and goodness frankly tendered their assistance whilst others resisted his most ardent solicitations with coolness and indifference  the connoisseur of real taste the admirer of historic composition where the sublime genius of the graphic art revels in her glory by exhibiting the thought the action and the very soul of man will find in the progress of this work a fund of information and entertainment not eclipsed by any productions from the annals of the grecian or roman empires  a treat also will be furnished for the amateurs of heraldry that typographic history of family alliances the proprietor reposing with confidence on their applause and courting only a fair comparison with others to ensure their approbation to the lovers of biography he humbly presents a compilation from the most authentic of all the english peeragists the late mr collins for the scottish genealogy he has selected from their most approved author mr douglas and in procuring materials for the irish peerage he has followed mr lodge the information of these gentlemen is brought down to the present time with improvements and amendments revised by an officer in the college of arms  the new plan here adopted of prefacing the history of the present peers by a brief account of the ancient families who were honored with those titles but now extinct is attended with utility and information inasmuch as it aids the genealogists and elucidates the annals of these kingdoms for in the process of time it frequently occurred that the same titles were bestowed on different personages by different sovereigns and without a considerable attention to chronology the reader is liable to confound one peer with another  perhaps it may be expected some apology should be made for deviating from the usual mode of publishing peerages under the names of the respective kingdoms separate from each other  on a reference to those publications it will be found that such of the nobility who possess peerages in two or in each of the three kingdoms are subject to much needless repetition and no otherwise varied than in the titles  by avoiding the old plan therefore and arranging them in the manner of a biographical dictionary the reference to any respective peer is accomplished with greater ease and facility and the order of precedence still faithfully preserved according to law and the article in the act of union as established in the reign of queen anne  many inaccuracies no doubt will insensibly creep into a work of this kind from the unavoidable multiplicity of figures and dates for such he solicits the correction and indulgence of the candid reader but to obviate those alterations which come under the description of the increase or decrease of families and titles it is the proprietors intention to give at the conclusion of the work an addenda stating such variations as will naturally occur during its progress  to expatiate on the advantages of biography to point out the utility and security of genealogy to exhibit to the world the national benefits accruing from that stimulus to great and noble actions honorary distinction to paint the ineffable esteem of a grateful people for the services of their worthy patriots to hold up for general imitation the examples of great and good men who have filled the various offices of church or state in the maintenance of order for the security of public right the protection of property and the liberties of their country would in this place be anticipating what the work is designed to effect  to avoid the imputation of prolixity and to encourage the pertinence of brevity is an object worthy the strict attention of the editor and no doubt requires a refined taste and a matured judgment without incurring the accusation of presumption he trusts he may premise that it is the first wish of his heart to execute it with accuracy and to pursue his plan with firmness reposing on the known taste and liberality of his country in patronizing undertakings dedicated not only to amusement instruction and utility but to aid a nobler purpose that of holding up the strongest incitement to emulation the example of others in the paths of every public and private virtue  reference to the historical and ornamental prints as also to the armorial bearings

acknowledged in scotland by all their historians and derived from a series of illustrious ancestors who possessed lochow in argyleshire according to the traditional accounts of the bards and sanachies as early as the time of king fergus ii who restored the monarchy of scotland a d  0  the first appellation they used was odwbin assumed from diarmed odwbin one of their ancestors a brave and warlike man and in the irish language his descendants are called to this time scol diarmed from this diarmed odwbin the bards have recorded a long series of the barons of lochow whose actions they tell us were renowned both for conduct and valor  paul odwbin lord of lochow called paul in spuran so denominated from his being the kings treasurer having no male issue his estate went to his daughter eva who married gillespick odwbin a relation of her own who changed the name first from odwbin to campbel to preserve and perpetuate the memory of a noble and heroic achievement performed by him to the crown of france in the reign of malcolm canmore from this gillespick is deduced the descent of the illustrious family of argyle    gillespick odwbin or campbel lord of lochow according to the ms history of the family lived in the reign of king david i and married eva only daughter and heiress of paul odwbin before noticed by whom he had a son    duncan campbel of lochow who succeeded him and flourished in the reign of king malcolm iv and left a son and successor    colin campbel of lochow who lived in the reign of king william sumamed the lion he left a son    gillespick or archibald campbel of lochow who succeeded him and flourished in the reign of king william and beginning of king alexander ii and is particularly mentioned in the statutes of that prince in the year      etc he married finetta daughter of john frazer lord of tweddale by whom he had a son and successor    duncan campbel of lochow who in the reign of alexander ii married a daughter of the family of cummyn by whom he had issue two sons sir gillespick and john a very famous author who flourished betwixt    0 and      and was an ornament to his country for learning etc duncan was succeeded by his eldest son    sir gillespick or archibald campbel knight of lochow who made a considerable figure toward the end of the reign of alexander ii and beginning of alexander iii in the charter of erection of the burgh of newburgh this gillespick campbel together with william earl of mar john de lindsay john de hay william bisset etc are witnesses at strivling  th of march      he married a daughter of william de somerville baron of carnwarth by whom he had issue one son    sir colin moor campbel dominus de lochow who succeeded him a renowned and warlike chieftain he had the honor of knighthood conferred on him by king alexander iii anno    0 and from him the chief or head of the family of argyle is called macallenmore in the highlands to this day he was one of the great men who were summoned to berwick on the part of robert de bruce in the competition with john de baliol for the crown of scotland on the demise of queen margaret this sir colin acquired from sir william lindsay the lands of symington in airshire and made a donation of the superiority thereof to the monks of newbottle by a charter wherein he is called dominus colinus campbel miles fdius quondam domini gillespick campbel etc anno      in a conflict with a great neighbor of his the lord of lorn he was slain at a place called the string of cowel his death occasioned much bloodshed and kindled such a flame of animosity betwixt the two families of lochow arid lorn as was not extinguished for many years after even so long as the argadii lords of lorn existed  this colin by his wife a lady of the family of the sinclairs had three sons sir neil his successor sir donald campbel of redhouse or reidcastle of whom the family of loudon and other cadets of this illustrious branch of the campbels derive themselves and also john campbel who was educated to the church    sir neil campbel his eldest son was honored with knighthood by king alexander iii at the end of his reign but none of his achievements are particularized till the year      that on the demise of queen margaret he was one of those eminent men summoned to berwick on the part of robert de bruce when he and all the other competitors for the crown of scotland had referred the decision of their respective claims to edward i of england and when that prince declared in favor of john de baliol sir neil campbel did so far acquiesce in the decision as to remain faithful to king john till that unhappy prince unkinged himself by an inglorious surrender of the independency of the crown to the king of england whom he acknowledged superior and direct lord of scotland  but no sooner did robert de bruce reassert his title to the crown and formed a rational project of recovering his own right and of freeing his country from its subjection than sir neil campbel was among the first of the numerous patriots that resorted to him owned his title and gave so many proofs of his zeal and merit for the liberty and honor of his country and of his loyalty to that heroic prince that he was thought most worthy and appointed to command a party of loyalists sent to argyleshire to curb and overawe the lord of lorn who was a declared enemy to the liberty of his country and of consequence to the brucian title he performed that service committed to him with honor and success insomuch that in a short time he recovered the countries of argyle and lorn and brought them to submit to king robert though opposed by the joint efforts of the lord lorn and his numerous accomplices  sir neil stood firm to king robert and was among those scots patriots that

duke of athole all the scottish antiquaries agree that the surname of murray is among the most ancient in their country and that the family possessed large estates in perthshire and other parts of the north of scotland as early as the ninth and tenth centuries but differ as to their origin some deducing them from the moravii a warlike people said to have come from the continent and performed signal exploits under corbredus galgacus or galdus against the romans and particularly at the battle fought at the grampian mountains a d    and fully described by tacitus whilst others assert that the

of their distress invited them into his country  they set forth from winheim in april        and   philip and mary but in their way underwent diverse great hardships with no little danger of their lives by the landgraves soldiers who by reason of a quarrel for a spaniel which they had along with them thrust boarspears into the wagon where the duchess with her children and the other women were and upon pursuit of her husband into a village had murdered him but that he forsook his horse and ran up a ladder set to a garret window near the top of an house by which means escaping their sudden fury one of the burghmasters came to him and brought another person who could speak latin to whom submitting himself he presently dispatched letters to the earl of erbagh dwelling within eight miles who thereupon repairing thither showed them such respect as properly belonged to persons of their quality and seeing the earls behavior to them the authors of the fray got off and made all the friends they could to them not to report their usage in the worst manner after which they passed on quietly toward poland where they received courteous entertainment from the king and were honorably placed in

this character he was says he a man of great honor and spent the youth and vigor of his age in military actions and commands abroad and albeit he indulged to himself great liberties of life yet he still preserved a very good reputation with all men and a very great interest in his country as appears by the supplies he and his son brought to the kings army the companies of his own regiment of foot being commanded by the principal knights and gentlemen of lincolnshire who engaged themselves in the service principally out of their personal affection to him he was of a very generous nature and punctual in what he undertook and in exacting what was due to him which made him bear that restriction so heavily which was put upon him by the commission granted to prince rupert and by the kings preferring the princes opinion in all matters relating to the war before his nor did he conceal his resentment for the day before the battle he said to some friends with whom he had used freedom that he did not look upon himself as general and therefore he was resolved when the day of battle should come that he would be at the head of his regiment as a private colonel where he would die he was carried out of the field to the next village and if there could have been a surgeon procured it was thought his wound would not have proved mortal and as soon as the other army was composed by the coming on of the night the earl of essex about midnight sent sir william balfour and some other officers to see him and meant himself to visit him they found him upon a little straw in a poor house where they had laid him in his blood which had run from him in great abundance he said he was sorry to see so many gentlemen some whereof were his old friends engaged in so foul a rebellion wishing them to tell the earl of essex that he ought to throw himself at the kings feet to beg his pardon which if he did not speedily do his memory would be odious to the nation and continued this kind of discourse with such vehemence that the officers by degrees withdrew themselves and prevented the visit the earl of essex intended him who only sent him the best surgeons but in the very opening of his wounds he died before morning by the loss of blood he had very many friends and few enemies and died generally lamented  he married elizabeth only child of edward the first lord montagu of boughton in

was served heir male and of talzie to sir richard murray of cockpool his brother german on the   th of august      was the first that had the titles of viscount annan and earl of annandale conferred on him he was first designed by the title of lochmaben then of dundrenan etc and obtained several charters under the great seal by both these titles before he was advanced to the peerage being a man of singular accomplishment of great worth and merit and in high favor with king james vi was chosen one of his attendants to accompany him to england in   0  he had the honor of knighthood conferred on him soon after his arrival was made one of the gentlemen of the bedchamber and also appointed master of the horse  and was afterward raised to the dignity of the peerage by the titles of viscount annan and earl of annandale by letters patent to the heirs male of his body dated march         he died in    0 leaving issue by elizabeth his countess daughter of john schaw knight one son  james second earl of annandale who retired into england where he had lived privately during the time of the civil war in the reign of charles i he succeeded also to the honors of stormont according to the

of stormont devolved upon the next heir male according to the patent and substitution in the entail etc etc  johnston marquis of annandale the ancestors of the johnstons on whom this title was conferred were a bold intrepid and hardy race of men and had always distinguished themselves for their bravery in the field and particularly so in repelling the inroads or invasions of the english borderers and with that spirit peculiar to the times never failed in avenging the injuries done either to their king or their country the time that this family began to make a figure in scotland was in the reign of alexander ii about the year      and they soon afterward became numerous and powerful and were possessed of considerable estates in many different counties which appears from unquestionable documents and charters under the great seal in the public register  hugo de johnston was proprietor of lands in eastlothian in the reign of king alexander ii and was father of  john de johnston who made a donation to the monastery of soltry pro salute animae suae of part of his lands in eastlothian of which it seems the family of keith were superiors for the donation is confirmed by robert de keith great marishal of scotland to which dominus ricardus de keith his brother adam de keith his uncle john de keith etc are witnesses the confirmation is without date but appears to have been before the year       thomas le johnston gilbert de johnston and wauter johnston are all found swearing fealty to king edward i of england inter      et      but we can give no further account of their posterity  we therefore proceed to deduce the descent of this noble family from their undoubted ancestor  sir john de johnston was one with others of the scotch barons that were forced to swear fealty to king edward i when he had overrun scotland anno      and is then designed johannes de johnston chevalier del comitat de dumfries etc the abovenamed gilbert is thought to have been his brother sir john was father of  john de johnston who flourished in the reign of king robert bruce and is particularly mentioned in a charter of thomas ranulph earl of murray of the lands and barony of cumlangum which he gave to his nephew william de moravia etc the charter must have been granted before      in which year the earl died he left issue a son and successor  gilbert de johnston who is witness in the same charter with his father to william de moravia and dying about the year    0 was succeeded by his son  sir john de johnston who made a great figure in the reigns of king david bruce and king robert ii he engaged and defeated a large party of the english who had invaded the borders of scotland anno    0 he was also one of the guardians of the west marches anno      where he had often an opportunity of exerting his courage and conduct against the english borderers and was then designed dominus de johnston he died about the year      or      and left issue a son  sir john johnston designed dominus de eodem miles who succeeded him about this time there were forty thousand francs sent by the king of france to be divided amongst the scotch nobility his faithful allies of which sir john johnston had three hundred allotted to him for his share anno       sir john together with sir john carlyle and sir william stuart of castlemilk were appointed by the earl of douglas then chief warden of the marches sureties for the keeping of a truce with the english anno      and dying about the year    0 was succeeded by his son  sir adam johnston dominus de eodem who raised his vassals and followers joined the scotch army under the command of the brave earl of ormond and behaved with great spirit and gallantry against the english at the battle of sark where the scots obtained a considerable victory he with his sons sir john and matthew de johnston were afterward very instrumental in suppressing the rebellion of the earls of douglas for which signal act of loyalty and firmness king james ii rewarded him with a grant of the lands of peddinane in lanarkshire etc  there is an instrument of seisin of the twenty merk land of peddinane granted to matthew de johnston upon a precept from the chancery proceeding upon a charter from king james ii dated november          this matthew de johnston styled strenuus armiger with his fathers men were the principal means of suppressing the rebellion of the earl of douglas by taking with his own hand the earl of ormond douglass brother prisoner the johnstons of westerhall are lineally descended from him and bear with the family arms for difference in memory of that achievement a mans heart ensigned with an imperial crown being a part of the armorial bearing of the house of douglas  we find that herbert de johnston got several lands in the barony of kirkmichael in dumfriesshire from the earl of crawfurd for liberating his person out of the hands of james earl of douglas who had taken him captive believing he had

th may      thus expresses himself as it is a singular contentment to a king to see his subjects desire to excel each other in virtues and commendable courses so there is nothing that does more incite them to such honest contentions amongst themselves than the hopes of honor and advancements which being long since observed by us we have at all times heretofore rewared such of our subjects with titles of honor as we have found deserving servants of the commonwealth and now having taken into our consideration the many and faithful services which our trusty and wellbeloved sir randal macdonnell knt during the troubles of that kingdom has as a valiant gentleman performed to our crown and how wisely and worthily he has since behaved himself as well for the settling a general peace in that our kingdom as in reducing to civility the barbarous people of those parts where he does reside we are graciously pleased as an especial mark of our favor toward him and a reward of his merits in both kinds to confer upon him the honor and dignity of a viscount of that our realm and do hereby require you etc the patent was accordingly dated   th june following and he was created viscount of

colonel gordon who commanded a regiment in major general robert monroes army in the north   randal the second earl and first marquis of antrim was born in the year   0  being a nobleman of an high spirit and great activity he carried a considerable aid in      to king charles in his first expedition against the scots which being ended in a short time he attended his majesty to oxford from whence returning to ireland he took his seat   th june    0 in the house of peers and as lord clarendon writes lived in splendour till the rebellion drove his lady again from thence who upon the queens first coming to oxford accompanied her majesty where she found great respect from all after which some false reports and aspersions were carried into england of the earls not only joining with the rebels but of being concerned in the very beginning of the rebellion but from that malicious charge sir william parsons one of the lord justices under whose eye he lived at that time in dublin wrote into england a vindication of him and it is certain he was so far from being any ways engaged in the beginning of the rebellion that he retired with his lady from dublin soon after its commencement to the earl of castlehavens seat at maddenstown near kildare and lived there some five or six months in peace and quiet until after the battle of kilrush   th april      relieving and entertaining during that time many distressed protestants of the neighboring country who doubtless must have perished had he not saved and sheltered them and such as were in want were sent to dublin provided with both money and clothes  soon after the said battle of kilrush the people having threatened to pull down the house over his head he sent his lady into england and going to his estate in      where he arrived   th april betook himself to the rebels in the north with an imagination that his quality and fortune would give him the supreme power over them which he never intended to employ to the prejudice of the king as appeared plainly from this that though they were glad of his presence and to have his name known to be amongst them yet they had no confidence in him to advise or command them which proceeded chiefly from the freedom he took in expressing his detestation of their actions and measures and relieving the miseries and distresses of the british protestants particularly those of coleraine besieged by the irish and in the utmost distress to whom he did all the good offices which either his rank consanguinity or religion could enable him to use with success endeavoring to engage the irish to raise the siege and by letters entreated a parley which being granted he prevailed so far with their officers that they promised liberty to the people of the town to take grazing for their cattle safely for at least three miles compass after which his lordship sent into the town about threescore horses laden with corn for the benefit of the inhabitants  notwithstanding this service and that by his interest and among his tenants he raised a regiment yet major general monroe commander of the scots forces on pretense that some other of his tenants were in the rebellion but in reality to gratify his own avarice by possessing his estate and plundering his house seized his person in may      whilst he was entertaining him in his castle of dunluce and sent him prisoner to carrickfergus whence having the good fortune to make his escape into the northern parts of england he waited on the queen then at york who to promote the cessation of arms with the irish then become absolutely necessary by the extremities to which the army was reduced sent his lordship to ireland with letters and instructions to that purpose but he was again taken by monroe the very instant of his landing in the county of down and imprisoned in carrickfergus  after some months restraint he recovered his liberty by a second escape into england and arrived at oxford   th december      where his presence was not unacceptable monroe all the while enjoying his estate and refusing to allow him or his agents to receive the rents of it though repeated orders were sent from the king and the state of ireland for that purpose  he was no sooner arrived at oxford but the marquis of montrose proposing a scheme for raising such a body of the kings friends in scotland to oppose the covenanters who were then in a treaty with the parliament as should oblige the scots army to return out of england if he had but some troops to begin with and to serve for a pretension to the royalists that should join him consulted with the earl of antrim whether it might not be possible to draw a body of men out of ireland to be such a foundation for raising the said forces in scotland as might advance the enterprise he had so long inhis heart of doing the king service in the north and protecting the royalists that would join him in his undertaking the earl of antrim readily undertook that if the king would grant him a commission he would raise an army in ireland and transport it into scotland and would himself be at the head of it by means whereof all the clan of the macdonnells in the highlands might be persuaded to follow him  upon this overture the king conferred with the two noblemen together and knowing well that the earl of antrim had interest enough to raise as many men as should be desired in that part of the kingdom his majesty resolved to encourage it all he could which he did by creating him marquis of antrim by privy seal dated at oxford   th january       0 car i with the creation fee of  0l a year issuing out of the customs of the port of coleraine having received this honor and the kings commission he began his journey to raise the intended forces to be sent into scotland in april      but in the execution of his designs unforeseen difficulties often arising to retard them he could not raise them so expeditiously nor make good his undertaking effectually without the assistance or countenance of the supreme council at kilkenny to recommend himself to whom he took the oath of association and was made a member of that body whereby with the marquis of ormonds concurrence he sent off   th june      about   00 men under the command of colonel alexander macdonnell who landing about the end of july in the islands were recieved by the marquis of montrose and by their brave behavior laid the foundation of all the great enterprises he undertook and the amazing victories he gained in all which they constantly accompanied him  from this time till the month of february      we have no public mention of the marquis of antrim when he was appointed by the general assembly at kilkenny one of their three agents to the queen and prince in france to desire a lord lieutenant might be sent into ireland he returned in september   th of which month the marquis of ormond landed lord lieutenant at cork and   th january      concluded a peace with the supreme council but the popes nuncio declaring against it he was soon forced again to leave the kingdom yet the marquis of antrim and owen oneile adhering to him stood it out against the peace and at length the marquis entered into an intrigue with cromwell from whom in      he had an assignment of  00l a year and his protection from being arrested or imprisoned during his stay in the parliaments quarters having in       00l per annum allowed him yet he did not forget his duty to his prince which he expressed by assisting him with arms and ammunition when he was in the west of england and after his forces were defeated at worcester furnished him with ships to make his escape into foreign parts for which and other considerations he was retored to his estate by the acts of settlement and at length after much difficulty received a confirmation thereof by two patents under the great seal  he married to his first wife in april      the lady catharine manners daughter and heir to francis earl of rutland widow of george villiers the great duke of buckingham and to his second rose daughter of sir henry oneile of edenduffecarrick

 of john the eldest son hereafter  william ashburnham the second son served in his youth in the service of the states general against the spaniards in the netherlands and being an excellent soldier had a principal command in that army raised by king charles to march against the scots he was member in the two parliaments summoned in    0 and in the latter was examined on oath whether he knew any thing of that plot charged on the officers of the army for petitioning the king etc which he denied nervertheless the parliament voted that he should receive no pay standing thus in great umbrage with the parliament by whom he was in the sequel expelled with other loyal members and the kings affairs not yet permitting him to make use of his service he to avoid the clamor that was raised against him embarked on board a small flyboat for holland with some other officers who removed on the same account they had not been long at sea before they met with one of his majestys ships bringing ammunition to his assistance on which it was agreed that mr ashburnham and the lord digby should proceed on their voyage and the others should return with the ammunition but whilst this was agitating the parliament squadron came up and though the ship escaped yet the flyboat was taken and carried into hull where he was taken with the lord digby who concealed himself under the disguise of a frenchman till he sound a convenient opportunity to reveal himself to the governor sir john hotham whom he prevailed with to espouse his majestys interest and to surrender hull which design being at length rendered fruitless colonel ashburnham and the lord digby were dismissed by the governor and was the principal cause as lord clarendon writes of the loss of sir johns head  mr ashburnham came to his majesty about the time he set up his standard at nottingham which was on august   d      and entered on action with the first repairing to the marquis of hertford at sherburn where with a small force having kept that castle several weeks without being incommoded by the earl of bedford who watched them with a much greater army they marched from thence to minehead and there the marquis with some other gentlemen transported themselve into wales leaving this colonel ashburnham with sir ralph hopton and others to march into cornwall there they raised forces with such activity that in a small time they made themselves masters of the west and having performed very considerable services joined prince maurine at chard in somersetshire about the middle of june      with an army of  000 foot  00 horse and  00 dragoons of which colonel ashburnham had been major general  he was soon after made governor of weymouth on the opinion of his courage and dexterity as the earl of clarendon writes and to make way for him sir anthonyashley cooper was removed from that command he was made colonelgeneral of the county of dorset and in the year      having received express orders from prince maurice to quit all places that he conceived not tenable in case an army should advance into those parts he about june   th on the earl of essexs marching toward him quitted weymouth and retired to portland castle where he endured a siege of about four months with great patience and resolution suffering both by the want of men and provisions until he was relieved by the earl of cleveland and sir walter hastings appointed governor in his room however being censured for quiting of weymouth he at his own request had a public hearing before his majesty and the council to whom he so fully stated the matter of fact as sir edward walker writes in his history of the progress of the kings forces and the impossibility of keeping that place in case an army did attempt it together with his reasons for retiring to portland and how he disposed of his majestys arms and ammunition as that in the opinion of all there he was cleared from any crime or neglect  after the restoration he was made cofferer to charles ii and dying without issue in december      was buried in the church of ashburnham in sussex where a noble monument of white marble is erected to his memory with his effigy in a roman dress and the effigy of his lady in white marble reposing her right arm on a cushion an angel holding a wreath on her head and in a compartment of white marble is this inscription  under this tomb viz in the vault for this family lie the bodies of jane countess of marlborough and william ashburnham her husband second son of sir john ashburnham she was daughter to john lord butler of hertfordshire she was married first to james earl of marlborough lord high treasurer of england who after seven years died and left her a young beautiful and rich widow when this william coming from beyond sea where he was bred a soldier married her and after lived almost five and forty years most happily with her she was a very great lover and through gods mercy a great blessing to this family which is hoped will ever remember it with honoring her memory this william ashburnham her husband lived after her to a great age and gloried in nothing in this world but this his wife and the almost unparalleled love and entire friendship that for above  0 years was between his dear elder brother john ashburnham and himself he was cofferer to king charles the first and king charles the second he died without issue and by gods blessing was a happy preserver of his brothers posterity  the praise and glory of it be to god alone  john ashburnham eldest son and heir of sir john and brother to william ashburnham last mentioned was one of the grooms of the bedchamber to charles i and in    0 was elected to parliament for the port of hastings he attended on his majesty during the rebellion and his behavior was so satisfactory that the king had an entire confidence in him and was pleased to nominate him in      one of his commissioners for the treaty at uxbridge also in      the king desired of the parliament that a safe conduct might be granted to the duke of richmond the earl of southampton mr john ashburnham and mr jeffery palmer to come to westminster with his propositions for peace and he was also one with others appointed by his majesty to commit the militia for such time and with such power as expressed by his commissioners at uxbridge  on april   th      when his majesty thought proper to leave oxford mr ashburnham was the only servant that attended him and indeed the only person excepted a clergyman dr hudson who served as a guide afterward when the king was in the hands of the scots army he transported himself to france with his majestys approbation the scots threatening to deliver him to the parliament and had forbid him his majestys presence but when he heard the king was in the hands of the english army and that there was not the same restraint as formerly he resolved to make an adventure to wait on him and having by some friends a recommendation both to cromwell and ireton who knew the credit he had with the king and that his majesty would be very well pleased to have his attendance and look on it as a testimony of their respect to him he was left at liberty to repair to the king and was very welcome to his majesty he and sir john berkeley who came from france at the same time were the two principal agents for conferring both with his majestys friends and with the officers of the army as often as they desired but the army having got the sole power and subdued all opposition from the parliament as well as the city they began not only to be less regardful of these his majestys agents but even of the king himself who therefore resolved to make his escape mr ashburham was chiefly confided in and he and sir john berkeley having passes sent them to go beyond the seas contrived means for his majestys escape from hampton court which was effected on november   th      and having conducted the king to the seacoast they were sent to treat with colonel hammond governor of the isle of wight to take the king into his protection which he seemed to comply with but by a fatal mistake of this mans honor that unhappy prince was delivered into the hands of the army this occasioned a suspicion of mr ashburnhams as well as berkeleys fidelity but it chiefly lay on the former because as lord clarendon writes it was inferred he was known to have so great an influence on his majestys councils and resolutions that he could not be ignorant of any thing that moved him  yet lord clarendon who discourses largely of this affair sufficiently clears mr ashburnham from the imputation laid to his charge saying that he preserved his reputation and credit with the most eminent of the kings party and his remaining in england after the death of the king which his enemies charged as an aggravation of suspicion against him was upon the marriage of a lady by whom he had a great fortune and many conveniences which would have been seized by his leaving the kingdom and he did send over to king charles ii and had leave to stay there and sometimes supplied the king with considerable sums of money afterward he was committed to the tower by cromwell where he remained till his death and the king was known to the last to have had a clear opinion of his affection and integrity and when king charles ii returned most of those of the greatest reputation as the marquis of hertford and the earl of southampton gave him a good testimony  upon the whole says the same historian it is probable that cromwell who many years after committed him to the tower and did hate him and desired to have taken his life would have been glad to have blasted his reputation by declaring that he had carried his master to the isle of wight without his privity merely upon his own presumption besides he was a person of unblemished honor and veracity and had not any temptation and never gave any cause in the subsequent actions of his life to have his fidelity suspected  in a manuscript i have seen wrote by this mr ashburnham in his own vindication he thus expresses himself and though for no other motive yet for this that my own posterity may know i have not stupidly through silence passed by the heavy censures upon me there shall be for their information this faithful discourse extant to settle their judgments of my integrity to his majesty and prevent the irreverence which otherwise may perhaps not only be paid to them to my memory but give them cause taking loose reports for granted truths to loath themselves for being branches of so unworthy and wicked a stock  if men would but as well consider the painful and vexatious partimposed on me during all the wars as they look upon the privileges i enjoyed by my near relation to his majestys service they would find more cause to pity me for my labors than to envy me for the honor or profit of my employments for from the time his majesty went last from london to the time he left oxford to go to the scots army i will confidently affirm i lived as painful and as servile a life as any whoever he was of the meanest degree but i hope that an unhappy fate which has hitherto followed me will at least leave me in this so that i may not be understood to repine at the hardships of my duty had the travel of my body or mind been much more beset with toils and difficulties i should with the same cheerfulness have waded through all when in the least measure there had been question of pursuing his majestys interest it is no part of my intentions to adventure upon the history of the unfortunate divisions between his majesty and the two houses of parliament my business being only to deliver so much as my duty was particularly concerned in when his majesty was pleased to remove from oxford to the scots army and from hampton court to the isle of wight and not to trouble myself or others with more than what is pertinent to the suppressing those false and horrid aspersions cast upon my fidelity in both these actions wherein i shall be careful that nothing shall fall from me the truth whereof i will not be ready at all times to justify with my life  to wave therefore all things that passed between his majesty the two houses of parliament and their armies till the month of april      i hold it fit to give the state of things that when his majestys forces were reduced to the last period which i take to be the time that oxford was besieged it was judged necessary by all considering men that his sacred person should not be liable to the success of an assault for conditions or treaties seemed vain to be expected where the king was but that some expedient should be found by escape from thence to save his life though nothing could be thought on in order to his flight that in point of danger kept not equal pace with the hazard of his stay notwithstanding it was then first debated as the king was pleased to tell me whether it were not better for his majesty to stay than leave oxford etc  after the restoration he was restored to his former post of groom of the bedchamber and was elected one of the knights of the shire for sussex to that parliament which met at westminster anno      he lies buried in the chancel of ashburnham church under a noble monument of black and white marble whereon lies the effigies in full proportion of a gentleman in armor between his two wives the one in a winding sheet and the other in a baronesss robe with a coronet on her head all their hands elevated and underneath are the figures of four sons and four daughters kneeling before a desk over all in an arch of white marble supported by two black marble pillars is the following inscription on black marble in gilt roman letters  here lies in the vault underneath john ashburnham esquire of this place son to the unfortunate person sir john ashburnham whose good nature and frank disposition toward his friends in being deeply engaged for them necessitated him to sell this place in his family long before the conquest and all the estate he had elsewhere not leaving to his wife and six children the least substance which is not inserted to the least disadvantage of his memory god forbid it should be understood to be a charge of disrespect upon him but to give god the praise who so suddenly provided both for his wife and children as that within less than two years after the death of the said sir john there was not any of them but was in condition rather to be helpful to others than to want support themselves may god be pleased to add this blessing to his posterity that they may never be unmindful of the great things he has done for them the wife of the said sir john ashburnham was daughter to sir thomas beaumont of staughton in

bruce earl of ailesbury the family of bruce is of the same lineage as the kings of scotland being descended from robert le brus or bruis a noble knight of normandy who was a person of such note and valor and so much confided in by william duke of normandy that after his victory obtained on october   th  0   over harold king of england he sent him to subdue the northern parts of that realm which having successfully performed he was rewarded with no less than fortythree lordships in the east and westridings of yorkshire and fiftyone in the north riding of that county where the manor and castle of skeleton was the capital of his barony he likewise obtained by conquest and other ways heart and hertness in the bishopric of durham this robert died about the year   00 according to some writers but according to others about the year  0   and left issue a son and successor  robert de bruis second lord of skeleton a man of great worth and honor who contracted a great friendship with david i king of scotland while that monarch remained in england where he was styled earl and prince of cumberland during the reign of alexander i his brother and predecessor and was also earl of northumberland huntingdon and northampton in right of his consort mathilda or maud daughter of the renowned earl waltheof this robert de bruis accompanied king david into scotland and was accounted one of his nobles and subjects as is evident from the register of he bishopric of glasgow where it is recited that david by writ between the years    0 and      gave centum solidorum in hardingestra in northamptonshire for repairing the church of glasgow with the consent of mathilda his wife et procerum et militum meorum roberti de brus etc it is equally evident from sundry documents that the same robert was possessed on the lordship of annandale which contained all the lands from the bounds of dunnegal and strathnith to the lands of ranulph de meschines then earl of chester and lord of cumberland and it is affirmed by some historians that by the mediation of king david he obtained them in marriage with agnes annand heiress of that vast estate of which he got confirmation from that monarch and thereby had large possessions in both kingdoms as he was a man of great parts and equally qualified for the cabinet and the field he was in high favor with henry i king of england as well as with the said david king of scotland being at the court of england a d      king stephen joined him in commission with bernard de baliol to endeavor to dissuade or divert king david from his intended invasion of england and robert used all his interest with the scottish monarch but to no purpose for that prince neglecting the advice pursued his former resolutions and entered england with a considerable army upon that robert withdrew his allegiance from david and was on the english side at the famous battle of the standard which proved fatal to the scots and was fought in      near northalverton or northallerton in yorkshire in this action robert de brus took prisoner his own son robert who had been left in scotland and was then about    years of age when the father presented him to king stephen his majesty desired that he might be delivered to his nurse to be taken care of an sir william dugdale says he was more fit to be eating wheatbread with his mother than by force of arms to be defending his patrimony of annandale etc however peace being concluded next year between the two kingdoms in consequence of which northumberland was given to henry prince of scotland robert continued in favor and friendship with king david ever after  this robert was very eminent for his piety and devotion having in         henry i as appears by sir william dugdales monasticon founded a monastery for canons regular of st augustine at gysburn or gisburne commonly called gisborough in cleveland agnes his wife and adam his son and heir joining with him therein amply endowing it with  0 carucates of land each carucate then containing  0 acres this monastery was the common burialplace of the nobility and persons of rank in those parts and its church by the ruins seems to have been equal to the best cathedrals in england he also bestowed upon the same monastery the patronage of all the churches within his lordship of annandale viz the churches of annand lochmaben kirkpatrick cumbertrees renpatrick drivesdale hodham castlemilk grentenhou with all the appurtenances of each and singular of those churches he also gave the church of middlesburgh with two carucates and two bovates of land in nehuham to the monks of whitby in yorkshire on condition that they should place certain of their convent there with which they complied and made it a cell to their abbey he likewise gave to the abbey of st marys at york his lordships of appilton and hornby with all the lands lying betwixt the same and the great road leading from york to durham being part of his lordship of middleton he also gave them two carucates of land and a mill in sunderlandwick as also the town of karkarevill which by the monks of that house were assigned to their cell at wederhal in cumberland according to sir william dugdale he departed this life   id maii ie may   th      and was buried in the said abbey of gisburne but according to sir james dalrymple in the year      however he had two wives  st agnes and english lady daughter of fulco paynell with whom he had the manor of carleton and  d agnes annand who brought him the lordship of annandale as beforementioned by the first he was father of a son adam his successor in most of the english estates and by his  d lady he had two sons william of whom afterward as continuator of the male line of this illustrious family and robert taken prisoner as before recited but of whose posterity there is no certain evidence he is likewise said to have had a daughter agatha wife of ralph son of ribald lord of middleham in yorkshire who had with her in frankmarriage the lordship of ailewick in hertness in the palatinate of durham  his eldest son adam third lord of skeleton behaved with great valor in the aforesaid battle near northalverton against the king of scotland according to the piety of those times he founded the priory of hoton in yorkshire and he and ivetta his wife dedicated the church of thorp to the cathedral

scottish crown with john baliol the other claimants suits being set aside when the right of succession was declared to be betwixt these two candidates it was alleged among other arguments for robert bruce that it was customary in scotland for the brother of the last king to be preferred to his son and adduced an example of donald vs succeeding to the throne a d     in preference to king constantine ii the son of his elder brother king kenneth ii commonly called mac alpin that king alexander ii who died in      esteemed robert as his heir in failure of the descendants of his own body even to the knowledge of dornagild or derveguld his roberts mothers eldest sister and john baliols mother who was then alive and assented to it at least did not contradict it having no male issue of her own that it was a constant maxim in scotland for the son of the second daughter to be preferred to the heir female of the eldest daughter and that king alexander iii acknowledged this robert to be next heir to the crown failing heirs of his own body all which was offered to be proved by living witnesses it was urged for john baliol that he stood one degree nearer in consanguinity to david earl of huntingdon his grandmother margaret being eldest daughter of that prince and that consequently the crown belonged to him on that principle though the learned mr thomas ruddiman has clearly proved the right of representation according to the then rules of succession to have been in bruce the forty chosen peers twenty of scotland and as many of england did at the tenth congress in the castle of berwick on november   th      declare john baliol king of scotland by the direction of edward i king of england who acted as umpire after that decision robert bruce and john hastings lord bergavenny

effectually to his interest agreed to make over to him all his paternal inheritance in that kingdom provided he would assist him to ascend the throne cumming readily embraced the offer as in case of a

obtaining the crown for himself john baliol having been dethroned by king edward about nine years before and then living in exile he disclosed the whole transaction to the king of england robert bruce

destroy him but being endowed with a large share of magnanimity and sagacity and his partisans being likewise possessed of the same qualities as well as an inviolable fidelity all the schemes against him proved abortive in a few years he became absolute master of scotland of which he not only secured quiet and respectable possession by the signal victory obtained at bannockburn on june   th      over a numerous army commanded by king edward ii but was also enabled to carry the war with success into the territories of his adversary the scottish historians considering this monarch as the deliverer of his country from foreign subjection and the restorer of its independency characterize him as a prince qualified equally for the cabinet and field and exclusive of the many heroes produced by his family sufficient not only to render it but even a whole kingdom illustrious his majesty was twice married  st to isabel daughter of donald tenth earl of mar and sister to the aforesaid gratney

the present royal family is descended  his lordship was amongst those peers who offered their service to king james on the prince of oranges embarking his troops for england but on that kings withdrawing from whitehall on december  0th      in order to embark for france the lords spiritual and temporal in and about westminster met at guild hall the next day and sending for the lord mayor drew up a declaration which was signed by the archbishops of canterbury and york the earls of pembroke dorset and twentyfive other peers among which the earl of ailesbury was the seventeenth that subscribed to it and agreed to the sending to the prince of orange the declaration sets forth that his majesty having withdrawn himself in order to his departure out of the kingdom by the pernicious counsels of persons ill affected to our nation and religion we cannot without being wanting to our duty be silent under these calamities wherein the popish councils which so long prevailed have miserably involved these realms we do therefore unanimously resolve to apply ourselves to his highness the prince of orange who with so great kindness to these kingdoms so vast expense and so much hazard to his own person has undertaken by endeavoring to procure a free parliament to rescue us with as little effusion as possible of christian blood from the imminent dangers of popery and slavery  and we do hereby declare the we will with our utmost endeavors assist his highness in obtaining such a parliament with all speed wherein our laws our liberties and properties may be secured the church of england in particular with a due liberty to protestant dissenters and in general the protestant religion and interest over the whole world may be supported and encouraged to the glory of god the happiness of the established religion and interest in these kingdoms etc  they further declared that they would as much as in them lay preserve the peace of london and westminster and would disarm all papists and secure all jesuits and romish priests who were in and about the same and if there were any thing more to be performed by them for promoting his highnesss generous intentions for the public good they should be ready to do it as occasion should require  the earl of ailesbury acquiesced in those measures as they were apparently the only means of reconciling the king and people and were entirely consonant to the prince of oranges declaration wherein he made not the least insinuation of a view to the crown when the king was stopped at feversham on december   th from going over to france on the new thereof the peers and privy council met and after some debates they appointed this earl of ailesbury william paston earl of yarmouth lewis duras earl of feversham and charles middleton earl of middleton to wait on his majesty to invite his return to his palace at whitehall to which he showed some reluctance yet at last condescended to their request afterward when the princes orders were communicated by three peers about one in the morning of december   th to the king then in bed for his majesty to quit his place of whitehall the earl of ailesbury with edwardhenry lee earl of litchfield james earl of arran afterward duke of hamilton and george douglas earl of dunbarton went with the king in his barge who had  00 of the princes dutch forces to guard him to rochester the same day the prince came to st jamess and the king determining on going to france about three in the morning of december   d privately withdrew himself without communicating his design to any of his lords not even the earl of dunbarton who lay in his chamber and did not awake till he was gone the earl of ailesbury returned to london but never took the oaths to king william and queen mary in    0 whilst king william was in ireland the french after defeating the english fleet under the earl of torrington threatened a descent in england and queen mary using all precautions to obviate the danger thereof published a proclamation on july  th for apprehending edwardhenry earl of litchfield thomas earl of ailesbury william lord montgomery son to william marquis of powis and diverse others suspected to adhere to their majesties enemies in the expected invasion however his lordship was not imprisoned on that occasion for on january  th following    0  king william gave the royal assent to an act to enable thomas earl of ailesbury and elizabeth countess of ailesbury his wife to make provision for payment of debts and to make leases of their estates and in      when the queen on may  th another invasion being threatened published a proclamation for apprehending robert leak earl of scarsdale the beforementioned earl of litchfield and others the earl of ailesbury was not among them in      the earl of ailesbury was said to have been at a meeting in may at the old kingshead tavern in leadenhallstreet london with the lord montgomery sir john friend sir john fenwick mr robert charnock and others when they consulted how to restore king james and all agreed to send a special messenger to desire him to procure of the french king  0000 men bishop burnet in his history of his own time recites that after queen marys decease the jacobites began to think the government had lost the half of its strength and fancied an invasion in the kings absence would be an easy attempt and thereupon sent over to france charnock a fellow of magdalen college who in king jamess time had turned papist to let them know they would bring a body of  000 horse to meet such an army as should be sent over but charnock came back with a cold account that nothing could be done at that time upon which it was thought necessary to send over a man of quality who should press the matter with more authority so the earl of ailesbury was prevailed on to go he was admitted to a secret conversation with the french king and this gave rise to a design which was very near being executed the following winter and in       when sir john friend on march   d and sir william perkins on the   th were tried and suffered for sir george barclays plot on april  d following it appeared that in may      charnock had been sent over with a message to king james as beforementioned and that the earl of ailesbury the lord montgomery and sir john fenwick were also concerned upon which evidence the earl of ailesbury was committed prisoner to the tower in february       the bishop further observes that peter cook son of sir miles being brought to his trial on may   th      was on account of the intended invasion being not charged with the assassination and that his trial was considered as introductory to the earl of ailesburys for the evidence was the same on both george porter and cardell goodman were the two witnesses against him on his meeting with the earl of ailesbury and others in leadenhallstreet all that was brought against their evidence was says the bishop the master of the tavern and two of his servants swearing that they remembered well the company which was at the tavern for they were often coming into the room where they sat both at dinner time and after it and they saw not goodman there nay they were positive he was not there on the other hand porter deposed that goodman was not with them at dinner but came after and sent him a note upon which he with the consent of the company went out and brought him in the jury considered that the servants of the house were not in constant attendance nor could they be believed in a negative against positive evidence to the contrary and it might be well supposed that for the interest of their house they might be induced to make stretches and thereupon cook was found guilty and condemned he obtained many short reprieves upon assurances he would tell all he knew but as he did not deal sincerely his punishment ended in banishment sir john fenwick was next brought to his trial but goodman having been persuaded to go out of england there were not then two witnesses against him so by course of law he must have been acquitted and also on that account the earl of ailesbury never came to his trial but sir john fenwick had confessed in hopes of pardon before the lords justices being on oath that the earl of ailesbury having been admitted to a private audience of the french king proposed his sending over an army of  0000 men and had undertaken that a great body of gentlemen and horses should be brought to join them yet at the same time as observed by bishop burnet took care to name none of his own side except those against whom evidence was already brought as in the case of the earl of ailesbury or who were safe and beyond sea and king william not being satisfied therewith sir john was attainted by parliament and suffered death on january   th       the countess of ailesbury his wife was so afflicted at his lordships confinement in the tower that she died in childbed on january   th       but the earl her husband was admitted to bail on february   th following his lordship afterward having obtained king williams leave to reside at brussels he there
