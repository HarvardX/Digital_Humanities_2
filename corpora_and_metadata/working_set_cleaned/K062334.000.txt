seeks her lonely cell and leaves the grate to solitude and me ii now throws the western sun a fainter glare and silence sooths the vestal world to rest save where some paleeyd novice wrapped in prayer heaves a deep groan and smites her guiltless breast iii save that in artless melancholy strains some eloisa whom soft passion moves absorpt in sorrow to the night complains for ever barred the abelard she loves iv within these ancient walls with moss overspread where the relenting sinner learns to weep each in her narrow bed till midnight laid the gentle daughters of devotion sleep v of wantonness the pleasurebreathing lay or laughter beckning from his rosy seat or vanity attired in colors gay shall never allure them from their lonely state vi for them no more domestic joys return or tender father plies his wonted care the nuptial torch for them must never burn or prattling infants charm the lingering year vii often do they weave the chaplets pictured gay to deck their altars and the shrines around how fervent do they chant the pious lay how through the lengthening isle the notes resound viii let not the gay coquette with jest profane mock their veiled life and destiny severe nor worldly beauty with a sneer disdain the humble duties of the cloistered fair ix the glistning eye the halfseen breast of snow the coral lip the bright vermilion bloom awaits alike the inexorable foe the paths of pleasure lead but to the tomb x nor you ye vain impute to these the fault if flattery to their fame no trophies raise where through the dome with grandeurs treasures fraught the numerous fopplings lift the voice of praise xi can artful phrases or alluring words bid the pale cheek assume a second prime can even apollos sweetlysounding cords arrest the speedy steps of conquering time xii perhaps in this drear mansion are confined some whose accomplished beauty can impart each soft emotion to the sternest mind and wake to extacy the beating heart xiii but pleasure flies them a forbidden guest decked with the flowers in youths gay path that bloom the claycold hand of penance chills their breast and over the rays of fancy throws a gloom xiv full many a rivlet wandering to the main sequestered pours it is solitary wave full many a flower is rooted from the plain to waste it is sweetness on the desert grave xv some veiled eliza like the clouded sun may here reside inglorious and unknown some like augusta might have reared a son to bless a nation and adorn a throne xvi from flattrys lip to drink the sweets of praise in rival charms with other belles to vie in circles to attract the partial gaze and view their beauty in the admirers eye xvii their lot forbids nor does alone remove the thirst of praise but even their crimes restrain forbids through follys labyrinth to rove and yield to vanity the slackened rein xviii to raise mid hymens joys domestic strife or seek that converse which they ought to shun to loose the sacred ties of nuptial life and give to many what they vowed to one xix far from the circle of the splendid throng they tread obscuritys sequestered vale their lonely hours unvaried creep along unfand by pleasures ever shifting gale xx what though they are sprinkled with etherial dew with blooming wreaths by hands of seraphs crowned though heavens unfading splendors burst to view and harps celestial to their ear resound xxi still grateful memory paints the distant friend not even the world to their remembrance dies their midnight orisons to heaven ascend to stay the bolt descending from the skies xxii for who entranced in visions from above the thought of kindred razes from the mind feels in the soul no warm returning love for some endeared companion left behind xxiii their joy encircled hearth as they forsook from some fond breast reluctant they withdrew as from the deck they sent a farewell look fair albion sunk for ever to their view xxiv for thee who mindful of the encloisterd train do in these lines their mournful tale relate if by compassion guided to this fane some kindred spirit shall enquire thy fate xxv haply some aged vestal may reply oft have we heard him ere auroras ray had painted bright the portal of the sky at yonder altar join the matin lay xxvi where hapless eloisa sought repose oft at yon grave would he her fate condole and in his breast as scenes of grief arose sigh the kind requiem to her gentle soul xxvii one morn i missed him at the hour divine along that isle and in the sacristy another came nor yet beside the shrine nor at the font nor in the porch was he xxviii the next we heard the bell of death intone and in the fearful grave we saw him laid approach and read on this sepulchral stone the lines engraved to sooth his hovering shade the epitaph xxix by fates stern hand untimely snatched away does this deep vaulted cave a youth unfold he gave to solitude the studious day and pity framed his bosom of her mould xxx with lyre devoted to companions ear did he bewail the vestals hapless doom often has this marble caught his falling tear and for that generous tear he gained a tomb the magdalens an elegy i at yonder hallowed rail what scenes appear a numerous train of suppliant nymphs i spy their youthful cheek is pald with early care and sorrow dwells in their dejected eye ii hark they awake a solemn plaintive lay where grief with harmony delights to meet not philomela from her lonely spray trills her clear note more querulously sweet iii are these the fair who wont with conscious grace proud ranelaghs resplendent round to tread shine in the studied luxury of dress and vie in beauty with the highborn maid iv the smiling scenes of pleasure they forsake obey no more amusements idle call nor mingling with the sons of mirth partake the treat voluptuous or the festive ball v for sober weeds they change their bright attire of the pearl bracelet strip the graceful arm veil the white breast that lately sighed desire and to the wrapped eye heaved the imprisoned charm vi unbraid the cunning tresses of the hair and each wellfancied ornamentremove the glowing gem the glittering solitaire  the costly spoils of prostituted love vii yet beauty lingers on their mournful brow as loath to leave the cheek bedewed with tears which scarcely blushing with a languid glow like morns faint beam through drizzling rain appears viii no more compare them to the stately flower whose painted foliage wantons in the gale they look the lily drooping from the shower or the pale vilet sickening in the vale ix let not the prude with acrimonious taunt upbraid the humble tenants of this dome that pleasures rosy bower they used to haunt and in the walk of looserobd dalliance roam x if fond of empire and of conquest vain they frequent votries to their altars drew yet blazed those altars to the fair ones bane the idol they and they the victim too xi some in this sacred mansion may reside whose parents ashes drank their early tears and hapless orphans trod without a guide the maze of life perplexed with guileful snares xii some that encircled by the great and rich were won by wiles and deepdesigning art by splendid bribes and soft persuasive speech of power to cheat the young unguarded heart xiii some on whom beauty breathed her radiant bloom whilst adverse stars all other gifts removed who fled from misery and a dungeons gloom to scenes their inborn virtue disapproved xiv what though their youth imbibed an early stain now gilded by the rays of newborn fame a second innocence they here obtain and cloistered penance heals their wounded name xv so the young myrtles nipt by treacherous cold while still the summer yields his golden store in sheltering walls their tender leaves unfold and breathe a sweeter fragrance than before xvi though whitewingd peace protect this calm abode though each illicit passion be suppressed still recollection wears a sting to goad still fangd remorse invades their anxious breast xvii the torturing hour of memory this may prove who wrapped in pensive secresy forlorn sits musing on the pledges of her love exposed to chilly want and grinning scorn xviii forgot deserted in the extremest need by him who ought to shield their tender age was this seducer this the promised meed she cries then sinks beneath afflictions rage xix another mourns her fall with grief sincere whom tranquil reason tells she is shunned disdained repulsed as vile by those who held her dear who called her once companion sister friend xx that recollects the day when lost to shame she fondly sacrificed her vestal charms resigned the virgins for an harlots name and left a parents for a spoilers arms xxi imagination pencils to her mind the fathers rage the mothers softer woe unhappy pair to that distress consigned a child can give a parent only know xxii the tragic picture fixes sorrows dart while filial passions in her breast revive she feels beakd anguish preying at her heart to natures pangs too sensibly alive xxiii if this or similar tormenting thought cling to their soul when pensively alone for youths offense for loves alluring fault say do they not sufficiently atone xxvi oh mock not then their penitential woes thou who may deign to mark this humble theme nor seek with foul derision to expose and give to infamy their tainted name xxv nor deem me one of melancholys train if anxious for the sorrowwedded fair tho little skilful of poetic strain whose pleasing music takes the tuneful ear xxvi i steal impatient from the idle throng the roving gay companions of my age to temper with their praise my artless song and softeyd pity in their cause engage xxvii it is virtues task to soothe afflictions smart to join in sadness with the fair distressed wake to anothers pain the tender heart and move to sympathy the feeling breast the nun an elegy tantum relligio potuit suadere malorum i with each perfection dawning on her mind all beautys treasure opening on her cheek each flattering hope subdued each wish resigned does gay ophelia this lone mansion seek ii say gentle maid what prompts thee to forsake the paths thy birth and fortune strew with flowers through natures kind endearing ties to break and waste in cloistered walls thy pensive hours iii let sober thought restrain thine erring zeal that guides thy footsteps to the vestal gate lest thy soft heart this friendship bids reveal like mine unblest should mourn like mine too late iv does some angelic lonelywhispring voice some sacred impulse or some dream divine approve the dictates of thy early choice  approach with confidence the awful shrine v there kneeling at yon altars marble base while tears of rapture from thine eyelid steal and smiling heaven illumes thy soul with grace pronounce the vow thou never can repeal vi but if misled by falseentitled friends who say  that peace with all her comely train from starry regions to this clime descends smooths every frown and softens every pain vii that vestals tread contentments flowery lawn approvd of innocence by health carest that robbed in colors bright by fancy drawn celestial hope sits smiling at their breast viii suspect their siren song and artful style their pleasing sounds some treacherous thought conceal full often does pride with sainted voice beguile and sordid interest wear the mask of zeal ix a tyrant abbess here perchance may reign who fond of power affects the imperial nod looks down disdainful on her female train and rules the cloister with an iron rod x reflection sickens at the lifelong tie backglancing memory acts her busy part its charms the world unfolds to fancys eye and sheds allurement on the wishful heart xi lo discord enters at the sacred porch rage in her frown and terror on her crest even at the hallowed lamps she lights her torch and holds it flaming to each virgin breast xii but since the legends of monastic bliss by fraud are fabled and by youth believed unbought experience learn from my distress oh mark my lot and be no more deceived xiii three lustres scarce with hasty wing were fled when i was torn from every weeping friend a thoughtless victim to the temple led and blush ye parents by a fathers hand xiv yet then what solemn scenes deceived my choice the pealing organs animating sound the choral virgins captivating voice the blazing altar and the priests around xv the train of youth arrayed in purest white who scattered myrtles as i passed along the thousand lamps that poured a flood of light the kiss of peace from all the vestal throng xvi the golden censers tossed with graceful hand whose fragrant breath arabian odor shed of meekeyd novices the circling band with blooming chaplets wove around their head xvii  my willing soul was caught in raptures flame while sacred ardor glowed in every vein methought applauding angels sung my name and heavens unsullied glories gilt the fane xviii methought in sunbeams robed the heavenly spouse indulged the longings of my holy love not undelighted heard my virgin vows  while over the altar waved the mystic dove xix this temporary transport soon expired my drooping heart confessed a dreadful void ever since alas abandoned uninspird i tread this dome to misery allied xx no wakening joy informs my sullen breast through opening skies no radiant seraph smiles no saint descends to soothe my soul to rest no dream of bliss the dreary night beguiles xxi here haggard discontent still haunts my view the sombre genius reigns in every place arrays each virtue in the darkest hue chills every prayer and cancels every grace xxii i meet her ever in the chearless cell the gloomy grotto and unsocial wood i hear her ever in the midnight bell the hollow gale and hoarseresounding flood xxiii this caused a mothers tender tears to flow the sad remembrance time shall never erase when having sealed the irrevocable vow i hastened to receive her last embrace xxiv fullwell she then presaged my wretched fate the unhappy moments of each future day when locked within this unrelenting grate my joydeserted soul would pine away xxv yet never did her maternal voice unfold this cloistered scene in all its horror dressed nor did she then my trembling steps withold when here i entered a reluctant guest xxvi ah could she view her only child betrayed and let submission over her love prevail the unfeeling priest why did she not upbraid forbid the vow and rend the hovering veil xxvii alas she might not  her relentless lord had sealed her lips and chid her streaming tears so anguish in her breast concealed its hoard and all the mother sunk in dumb despair xxviii but thou who ownst a fathers sacred name what act impelled thee to this ruthless deed what crime had forfeited my filial claim and given oh blasting thought thy heart to bleed xxix if then thine injured child deserve thy care oh haste and bear her from this lonesome gloom in vain  no words can soothe his rigid ear and gallias laws have riveted my doom xxx ye cloistered fair ye censurebreathing saints suppress your taunts and learn at length to spare though mid these holy walls i vent my plaints and give to sorrow what is due to prayer xxxi i fled not to this mansions deep recess to veil the blushes of a guilty shame the tenor of an illspent life redress and snatch from infamy a sinking name xxxii yet let me to my fate submissive bow from fatal symptons if i right conceive this stream ophelia has not long to flow this voice to murmur and this breast to heave xxxiii ah when extended on the untimely bier to yonder vault this form shall be conveyed thou wilt not refuse to shed one grateful tear and breathe the requiem to my fleeting shade xxxiv with pious footstep join the sable train as through the lengthening isle they take their way a glimmering taper let thy hand sustain thy soothing voice attune the funeral lay xxxv behold the minister who lately gave the sacred veil in garb of mournful hue more friendly office bending over my grave and sprinkling my remains with hallowed dew xxxvi as over the corse he strews the rattling dust the sternes heart will raise compassions sigh even then no longer to his child unjust the tears may trickle from a fathers eye alisia a ballad i to yon dark grove alisia flew just at the appointed hour to meet the youth whose bosom true confessed her beautys power ii all that fair beauty could bestow or fairer virtue give did on his face unrivaled glow and in his bosom live iii but not the charm of beautys flower or virtues fairer charm could in her fathers soul the power of avarice disarm iv he bad the youth his mansion fly and scorned his ardent vow and when the tears flowed from his eye he bad them faster flow v alisia with a bleeding mind beheld the injured youth and vowed in holy wedlock joined to crown at length his truth vi as she forsook her native seat farewell ye fields so fair may blessings still my father meet she said  and dropped a tear vii the oppression of a parents hand a parent dead to shame in her meek breast by virtue fand never quenched the filial flame viii now safe she reached the appointed ground though love was all her guide but absent when the youth she found she looked around and sighed ix each breeze that rustled over the tree soothed for a space her smart she fondly cried  oh that is he while patted fast her heart x the pleasing images of hope nights terrors now deform while on her mind drear sceneries open and raise the mental storm xi on some rude stone she bowed her head all helpless and forlorn now starting from her rugged bed she wished the lingering morn xii with heavy heart i now unfold what the absent youth befell who fierce beset by ruffians bold oppressed with numbers fell xiii at length the morn disclosed its ray and calmed alisias fear she restless took her various way distracted here and there xiv thus as she wandered wretched maid to misery doomed she found a naked corse along the shade and gashd with many a wound xv struck to the soul at this dread scene all motionless she stood to view the raven bird obscene drink up the clotting blood xvi what horrors did her breast invade when as she nearer drew the features that the raven fed her lover gave to view xvii with shrieks she rent the affrighted air to tears had fond recourse with frantic hand now tore her hair now sunk upon the corse xviii then throwing round a troubled glance with madness ray inflamed beheld some travelers advance to whom she thus exclaimed xix ye base inhuman train away what urged yon to this deed youve turned my gentle love to clay and bad me sorrow wed xx hark hark the raven flaps her wings  she drinks his blood again  ah i now she feeds on my heart strings  oh jesu soothe my pain xxi this scene of woe what could create the travelers admired while shrinking at the blow of fate she with a groan expired matilda a ballad i outrageous did the loud wind blow across the sounding main the vessel tossing to and fro could scarce the storm sustain ii matilda to her fearful breast held close her infant dear his presence all her fears increased and waked the tender tear iii now nearer to the grateful shore the shattered vessel drew the daring waves now cease to roar now shout the exulting crew iv matilda with a mothers joy gave thanks to heavens power how fervent she embraced her boy how blessed the saving hour v oh much deceived and hapless fair though ceased the waves to roar thou from that fatal moment never did taste of pleasure more vi for stepping forth from off the deck to reach the welcome ground the babe unclasping from her neck plunged in the gulf profound vii amazementchaind her haggard eye gave not a tear to flow her bosom heaved no conscious sigh she stood a sculptured woe viii to snatch the child from instant death some braved the threatening main and to recall his fleeting breath tried every art in vain ix but when the corse first met her view stretched on the pebbly strand awakning from her trance she flew and pierced the opposing band x with tresses discomposed and rude fell prostrate on the ground to the infants lips her lips she glewd and sorrow burst its bound xi uprising now with frantic air to the widecircling crowd who pitystruck partook her care she thus discoursed aloud xii heard ye the helpless infant weep saw ye the mother bold how as she flung him in the deep the billows over him rolled xiii may beakd remorse her bosom tea despair her mind upplough its angry arm let justice rear to dash her impious brow xiv but soft awhile  see there he lies embalmd in infant sleep why fall the dewdrops from your eyes what cause is here to weep xv yes yes his little life is fled his heaveless breast is cold what tears will not thy mother shed when thy sad tale is told xvi ah me that cheek of livid hue if much i do not err those lips were late the roses blew all all my son declare xvii strange horrors chill my every vein a voice confused and wild whispers to this distracted brain matilda slew her child xviii she added not  but sunk oppressed  death on her eyelids stole while from her much afflicted breast she sighed her troubled soul to   apollo bids the muses rove the lonely path the silent grove he bids the graces often resort to festive scenes and splendid court yet will he let the muse repair to where charlotta guards her heir unblamd the royal babe approach and strew fresh flowerets over his couch as on his cheek buds natures rose with virtues bud his bosom glows whose foliage opening into day shall each parental streak display and when the coming spring prevails with sweets maternal scent the gales your choicest wreath ye fairies bring to crown the little embrio king behold that hand with gewgaws play which shall britannias scepter sway attentive over the nursry plain behold him range his mimic men unconscious of the future hour when vested with imperial power he herolike shall lead his train to combat on a real plain while victory shall bless the war and scatter laurels from her car  illustrious babe though deaf to praise for thee i frame these humble lays the day will come but may kind fate keep back that day till very late when thou thy muchloved fathers heir like him shalt grace the regal chair shall hold approved the imperial helm and bless like him a grateful realm oh then shall praise ring out her peal and flattery her bright flowerets deal ah if thine eye in future time should chance to mark this artless rhyme when stretched beneath the funeral ground this frame shall lay with osier bound thou wilt find one of the muses train for thee awaked his gentle strain what time unconscious of the theme that did unfold thy future fame thou coudst not with a smile reward the numbers of the unvenal bard while they who shall these lines peruse if lines like these survive their muse shall own when they look up to you that he was bard and prophet too to the earl of chesterfield august  th i reclined beneath thy shade blackheath from politics and strife apart his temples twined with laurelwreath and virtue smiling at his heart ii will chesterfield the muse allow to break upon his still retreat to view if health still smooths his brow and prints his grove with willing feet iii though gratitude is rarely found at court or spacious drawing room still shall she tread poetic ground and favors past shall never intomb iv twas this awaked the present theme and bad it reach thy distant ear where if no rays of genius beam sincerity at least is there v may pale disease fly far aloof over venal domes its flag display and health beneath thy peaceful roof add luster to thine evening ray vi if this my fervent wish be crowned i will dress with flowrs the godheads shrine  nor thou with wisdoms chaplet bound at any absent gift repine vii what though thou do not grace a throne while subjects bend the supple knee no other king the muses own and science lifts her eye to thee viii though deafness by a doom severe steals from thy ear the murmuring rill or philomels delightful air even deem not this a partial ill ix ah if anew thine ear was strung awake to every voice around thy praises by the many sung would stun thee with the choral sound  the naiad to dr akenside i once did this cool and twilight grot which babbling streams surround and all this still umbrageous spot reecho to thy sound ii thy tuneful muse harmonious sound my mind retains the day when circling naiads beat the ground in honor of thy lay iii how pleasure brightened every face how murmured soft the stream how flushed each flower a newborn grace as conscious of thy theme iv ever since the mazy tinkling rill or philomelas air resounding clear at evening still are all the notes we hear v rejoin nor let this prayer be vain rejoin our pebbled haunts once more awake the unwilling strain that our fair troop enchants vi thee now alas occasion dear calls to this grottos gloom from naiads gush the heartsprung tear and soils their wonted bloom vii for aganippe lovely maid to mirth become a foe on her white arm reclines her head a prey to constant woe viii this morn at twilights grateful hour the subject naiad throng approached the virgins lonely bower and plied a soothing song ix but musics soothing art was vain to raise her eyelids dim till one of the fair choral train tuned thine unrivaled hymn x ah when that pleasing line was heard that sounds her grateful name her drooping head she gently reared and owned the powerful theme xi revisit then our watery bowers and bring thy magic lyre ah bring thy wreath of smiling flowers and lead the tuneful choir written in mr humes history i big with the tales of other years here lays the historic tome which to the pensive mind appears a deep capacious tomb ii where long embalmed by clios hand the patriot and the slave who saved and who betrayed the land press one extensive grave iii with those that grasped the imperial helm and trod the path of power with those who graced fair learnings realm and beautys fairer bower iv if thus the illustrious close their scene oblivion then may laugh what flows from humes immortal pen is but an epitaph the lilys triumph the sun unveiled his brightest ray the birds attund their sweetest lay as flora issued from her bower to shed perfumes on every flower as she approached her painted train with joy she viewed the cheerful scene this flower she kissed and that she raised  she gathered one another praised yet still of all her gay parterre the lily seemed her greatest care meek child the radiant goddess cried of gardens now be thou the pride know that lucinda beauteous fair does thee to all my train prefer ah go beyond thy equals blessed and breathe thine odor on her breast yet envy not that ivory shrine whose whiteness far surpasses thine by natures hand with incense spread whose sweetness far does thine exeeed enough that thou enjoyst the seat where virtue and the graces meet the rookery oh thou who dwellst upon the bough whose tree does wave its verdant brow and spreading shades the distant brook accept these lines dear sister rook and when thoust read my mournful lay extend thy wing and fly away lest pinionmaimd by fiery shot thou should like me bewail thy lot lest in thy rookry be renewed the tragic scene which here i viewed the day declined the evening breeze gently rocked the silent trees while spreading over my peopled nest i hushed my callow young to rest when suddenly an hostile sound explosion dire was heard around and levelled by the hand of fate the angry bullets pierced my mate i saw him fall from spray to spray till on the distant ground he lay with tortured wing he beat the plain and never cawd to me again many a neighbor many a friend deformed with wounds invoked their end all screaming omend notes of woe against man our unrelenting foe these eyes beheld my pretty brood fluttering in their guiltless blood while trembling on the shattered tree at length the gun invaded me but wayward fate severely kind refused the death i wished to find oh farewell pleasure peace farewell and with the gory raven dwell was it for this i shunned retreat and fixed near man my social seat for this destroyed the insect train that eat unseen the infant grain for this with many an honest note issuing from my artless throat i cheered my lady listening near working in her elbow chair the dialogue evander oh thou so very rarely found with youth at once and wisdom crowned if yet no swain with happy art ever fond a passage to thy heart stain not thy cheek with crimson hue but tell me fair belinda true each vain distinction i will remove and take thee for my bridal love  belinda this guileless breast does love awake it glows for my evanders sake no daring youth shall ever steal the sacred flame for thee i feel amid the grove the choicest tree does loved evander seem to me  evander that happy tree shall prove a screen to shield thee through lifes various scene from every gale that envy blows from every blast that misery knows from dangers threatening clouds that lower oppressions storm and sorrows shower a flower recoiling from the gale just wakening in the lowly vale and waving near the purest stream to me does fair belinda seen  belinda oh may the sun with powerful beam revive that flower beside the stream paint her all in the gayest bloom and call forth every kind perfume may flora come in welcome hour to raise her drooping from the shower may zephyr with his cooling breath still fan away the sultry death till perfected at length by time and opening in her brighest prime she may by love and fortune blessed breathe all her odors on thy breast  celia sleeping i where yonder shades exclude the skies the fairest of her sex was seen while morpheus sealed her radiant eyes and half eclipsed her lovely mien ii the unerring archer by her side in idle slumbers pressed the ground the feathered shafts in crimson died were innocently spread around iii twas then the youthful pleasures came by their transparent cincture known they danced around the beauteous dame and jocund stole her sacred zone iv the kind occasion cried  be bolds but celia thou had naught to fear the youth is by respect controlled whose bosom owns a love sincere v alarmed the little god i sought and seized his browencircling band by venus rosy singers wrought and veiled thy charms with trembling hand vi the godhead starting from his dream straight gathered every idle dart and then vindictive took his aim while many an arrow reached my heart vii nor yet content the godhead swore if thou would not the band deliver he would on me exhaust his store nor leave a dart within his quiver viii let then my life by thee secured over cupids spite at length prevail ah cure the wounds for thee endured and throw away the hateful veil to the d   of q  y when beauteous q  y reached her fiftieth year a period fatal to the blooming fair time snatched his hostile scythe intent to mow the native flowers that grace her lovely brow vain thought the scythe dropped harmless from his hand his hour glass falling lost the imprisoned sand his agitated breast confessed alarms and the worlds victor stood subdued with charms at length withdrawing he reversed the doom and bad her features wear unfading bloom the strawberries the winter left the naked plain and springs gay pencil decked the scene and as she waved her magic wand with early fruitage blushed the land twas then pomona raised her head and joyful viewed a strawbry bed two sister berries caught her eye impurpled with the brighest die these blushing twins the goddess said and plucked them from their verdant bed ill give to some thrice beauteous fair to bloom concealed beneath her care till an illustrious duke whose name is known to ancestry and fame conducted by some partial power shall gather them at midnight hour and love remove the slender vest to light him to the heavenly feast  the blushing twins she thus addressed then fixed them on amandas breast on lady sarah b  s cat with fancys gay suggestion fraught venus indulged a frolic thought departing from her former plan new schemes she framed to conquer man discharged her troop of smiling loves her archerson and cooing doves admitting to their vacant place the gentlest of the purring race this change of ministerial measures provoked at first the youthful pleasures they swore they would no more resort to paphos or the idalian court but reason their resentment cooled and bad them be by laura ruled ah happiest of the feline train will thou admit this artless strain the lover now for cupids dart shall feel thy talon at his heart thy form upon the seal impressed where venus once her birds expressed shall stamped upon the crimson glue secure the secret billetdoux echo amid the darkened grove shall heed no more the murmuring dove but in the precincts of white hall shall sit attentive to thy call ah happiest of the purring train when morpheus holds his silent reign thy queens love darting radiant eyes that emulate the starry skies it is thine with velvet foot to close and gently purr her to repose ah would thou purr this heart to rest and close the wounds within this breast how grateful would i wake the string and venus and her laura sing imitated from the french i straying beside yon woodskreend river dan cupid met my wondering view his feathered arrows stored his quiver each feather glowed a different hue ii for him who frames the daring deed the little godhead said and laughed to fly with miss beyond the tweed an eagles plume adorns the shaft iii the prattler vain of his address the magpyes feathers never fail and for the youth too fond of dress i rob the gaudy peacocks tail iv wheneer i mean to rouse the care that lurks within the jealous heart the owl that wings the midnight air lends his grave plume to load the dart v but rarely when i would assail the constant heart with truth impressed then for the trembling shaft i steal a feather from the turtles breast vi lo one with that soft plumage crowned which more than all my arms i prize  alas i cried this gave the wound when late you shot from julias eyes an elegy written among the ruins of an abbey i where sighs the zephyr to yon lonely tree a solemn grove its leafy mantle spread where bend yon mouldering turrets over the sea a venerable dome once reared its head ii the solemn grove the venerable dome were erst frequented by a numerous train even chaste as they who dians mountain roam but not subjected to her gentle reign iii far other goddess did this train obey far other temples other altars raised far other meaning breathed their choral lay far other incense on their altars blazed iv veiled superstition waked her magic sound bad albions sons forsake the splendid court forsake amusements variegated round and to her sable standard here resort v alas obsequious to her stern command a sullenpensive brotherhood they came refused to trace the paths by nature pland and razed from glorys page their ancient name vi nor these alone were found incloisterd here here also dwelt the simpleminded swain who wrapped in sloth dreamed out the lazy year while industry sat weeping on the plain vii the many temples rising fair to view which towering superstition called her own with hand unerring radiant truth oerthrew and snatched the impostor from her tinseld throne viii on yon dustleveld spire the crafty maid with indignation brooding in her breast sits gloomily  her votries all are fled her lamps extinguished and her rites suppressed ix within her hand a vacant string she holds that once connected many a hallowed bead the blotted scroll the other hand unfolds contains the maxims of her slighted creed x couched at her feet behold a mouldering shrine of various relics once the dread abode where runs the spider over his treacherous line where lurks the beetle and the loathsome toad xi on darkness wing now sails the midnight hour when for the grateful sound of choral prayer the shrieking owl from yon disparted tower with notes of horror wakes her trembling ear xii of human grandeur mark the fleeting day how frail each purpose and each wish how vain the strongbuilt domes the cloistered fanes decay and ruin hovers round the desert scene xiii the path that leads to yonder shattered pile is now perplexed with many a sordid brier no crowd is seen within the sacred isle the sabbath mourns its longdeserted quire xiv the golden crozier blended with the dust in horrid folds the serpent clasps around the powerful image and the sainted bust defamed unhallowed press the weedy ground xv not distant far her goldencircled tower the inviolable dome majestic reared on whose dread altar breathed some hidden power by terror guarded and by kings revered xvi to which asylum even the assassin came his hand audacious still imbrued with gore the boon of full impunity to claim while feeble justice wept her baffled lore xvii so truth at once dissolved the mental chain and banished error from the enlightened shore so closed at length the busyacted scene the curtain dropped and follys mask was over xviii then gladsome ceres raised her drooping head while yellow harvests gilt the smiling plain beheld a youthful band around her spread with sickles armed to reap the bearded grain xix the warrior then beneath the trailing vest the peaceful cassock or the drowsy cowl no longer quenched the flame within his breast or lulled the purpose of his daring soul xx but rushed undaunted to the doubtful war pursued where glory led the radiant way till neptune rising on his coral car resigned his watery world to britains sway xxi the virgin fair by venal guardians doomed by error prompted or
