but a frolic task a youthful play whose best reward was thy approving smile it scarcely claimed the offended critics rod we love to imitate what we admire the persian thus adores the solar god and lights faint emblem his terrestrial fire no longer inexperienced i presume on fancied worth beneath the quaint disguise but strip the veil remove th incumbent gloom and modern numbers give to modern eyes yet still to thee i dedicate the song language may change our friendship cannot fade to thee all virtues winning charms belong nor is my soul of fickle substance made the land of the muses may we unblamed in these fastidious times retreat to spensers allegoric rhimes his venturous step through fairy bowers pursue till almas castled dome appears in view there see advancing on the embattled plain guyon and arthur of heroic strain their martial grace their valiant deeds admire unwearied arms and unextinguishd fire when the base squadrons who besieged her rouud they forced to quit the field and shun the sacred ground then view brave guyon with intrepid heart against the enchanted bower of bliss depart while by his presence checked the sensual crowd led by malaeger confident and proud again invest the walls see arthur ride indignant forth and as antaeus died by hercules of yore the chief inclasp who breathed his last within his nervous grasp yet though renowns allenvied prize he won espy from many a gash the crimson current run there view the grooms and squires with tender speed respectful take him from his foaming steed and fairest alma costly spice prepare and wine and balm to administer with care eager her lively gratitude to express and aid her champion in his deep distress then of his armor gently disarrayd on richest sopha cause him to be laid and while his wounds they gird with circling band close by his side behold the virgin stand ah fools who think that temperance will refuse enjoyments sweet the souls refreshing dews to humankind or frowningly survey their feet proceed in pleasures roseate way see them recline beneath her myrtle bowers inhale the balmy air and pluck the innocuous flowers liberal and candid all delights she loves which taste desires and elegance approves fosters each genuine bliss to reason dear but hates impetuous passions mad career now while the prince nigh healed by almas skill felt health begin each languid vein to fill exhausted erst when in her cause he fought and with his blood the wellearnd triumph bought as well she knew the body and the mind in weal and woe essentially combined united each to each with strictest ties she bent her thought his mind to harmonize so to his ear closeseated by his side in accents duly couched her speech applied at times of chivalry wars purest flame and hardy knights who scorning abject shame trampled on death to gain immortal fame then as the powers of virtue listening stood of conscious worth she spoke and mental good and peace and civic merit laurelcrownd while he was ravished by the soothing sound with her two nymphs ministrant came prepared and when she paused the grateful labor shared for ever and anon would praisedesire open her ruby lips attune her lyre and sing her pensive notes the powerful strain charmed the sensation of internal pain infused serenest stedfastness and brought to justest temper each rebellious thought it seemed as if an angel from above melodious glided on the wings of love such silver tones the enamored gales prolong her flowing measures such and blandishment of song and often virgin bashfulness assayed the melting lute and sweetest descants played for she her instrument could aptly guide nor wanted in welldoing comely pride the princes bosom secret pleasure fills and every nerve the love of glory thrills his spirit seizes her celestial meed he meditates the unutterable deed rapt and beyond expression moved he sighs the living fire darts ardent from his eyes and drenched in bliss unknown to vulgar soul he lies one evening as these four excursive tread where that majestic stream is seen to spread whence guyon launched the country far and wide profusely watering with exhaustless tide arthur beholds the farther coast it is hills ascending steep it is vales meandring rills woods whose thick boughs a solemn shade diffuse and lawns which now declining phoebus views beaming the last remains of golden day then curious asked what region yonder lay that is the land replied the ingenuous fair apollos and the muses favorite care on which their blessings they benignly shower even to excess there in immortal bower close by the fount of hippocrene divine the unfading wreathe of harmony entwine there all their choral ecstasies repeat far from the world there fix their happy seat and scorn its vulgar herd and tasteless great there too is heartfelt joy with aspect bright and pain is banished thence and grief is put to flight there too a thousand beauteous forms reside to which in habit or in shape allied in other place the eye can never find beings invisible to common mind of purest nature and ethereal race girded with zones by every sister grace for there the graces shed their choicest rays while liberty with smiles before them plays and clad in robes of white each spotless virtue strays may not rejoined the prince a stranger sue those scenes thy lively words describe to view what bliss to travel through that region fair what bliss to mingle with the natives rare nor speak i urged by boastful folly vain yet in my heart is no illiberal stain honor has poured her influence on my mind and cherished passions generous and refined say whom must i invoke that purer mould to tread those forms ethereal to behold no base intruder no malicious spy seeking their hidden mysteries to defery then alma smiled and smiled the attendant twain o briton prince she said that blessed domain to me by young apollos self is given freely to enjoy to me that earthly heaven he grants to range from him the power is mine all lawless wanderers from the sacred nine to keep by force riots wild crew to quell and all the sons of insolence repel but ever modest merit to befriend direct his steps and my assistance lend but darkness now protrudes her shadowy cone the fields are trod by wakeful man alone take we our frugal meal and then to rest the beasts their couch the birds have sought their nest all but the beast of prey with ruthless mind threatening sell slaughter to the helpless kind and philomel whose conscious measures flow feeding the unsated luxury of woe now passionately full now soft and dying low tomorrow when the eastern clouds display their lucid pomp and crimson banners gay at my request a bark shall waft us over the expanded stream to yon sequestered shore the prospects which await us there to paint art cannot reach all language would be faint in courtly phrase the prince his thanks expressed for every polisht grace adorned his breast his eyelids light and transient slumbers close and in the morn with heavens first beam he rose his gentle guide not unprepared he found for when the lark soared upward from the ground with joy she heard his sweetlywarbled strain and brake the silken bands of sleep in twain then over the humid lawns they took their way the dewdrops glittering with the orient ray and to the rivers verdant margin sped where lay the expecting bark with sail unspread the pilot at the helm of aspect mild and bland yet piercing eye goodculture styled the knight and lady he with transport warm received then pushed far off with nervous arm unfurld his sail which gales propitious swelled and over the waves his easy course impelled the sparkling waves like lucid crystal gleam or like unclouded titans radiant beam for not the smallest stain or spot they know tho deep the tide the sands were seen below when they approached that shores extremest bound with springs eternal cestus girt around ambrosial airs mildbreathd their senses greet diffusing odours exquisitely sweet for zephyr there his softest plumes endued and chid each devious blast of pinions rude while flora hung with living gems the bowers and decked the turf with neverfading flowers blossoms and flowers of every various hue which once in edens happy garden grew now at the coast arrived they land with speed and now along the lilied banks proceed viewing in silence with attentive eye the scenes romantic which before them lie the prince at every turn to wonder yields at every turn new beauties crown the fields upon his cheeks a warmer glow is spread his bosom throbs with awe and pleasing dread such prospect frailer mortals scarce could bear he gazed and wished to gaze forever there his mild conductress bade him now behold where crossing over the velvetshaded mould two of the gentle habitants advance he sees and quits his visionary trance their eyes the glittering beams of pleasure dart their smooth brows speak their gayety of heart their virid garlands wantoned in the wind their nimble feet moved on as chance inclined and treading the soft turf no pressure left behind the one was youthful prime of comely grace the rising down began to shade his face unchanged by years the other was his bride hygeia she of firm affection tried from whom a son paced smiling by his side her presence every thought of time exiled so well each hour her converse sweet beguiled that tender imp whose smiles proclaimed his joy he named content to whom tho yet a boy is given exclusive power and wondrous might for ease of mind and spirits dancing light all those inspire on whom he casts his sight the blooming dame sustained an infant child simplicity by both his parents styled wellfavourd and of lovely hue to see stretching his little arms and telling his tale free to whom with bland demeanor alma said where widely your enchanted feet have strayed among the mazes of this flowery green tell me ye gentle pair if ye have seen where fancy now resides for like the wind i know the sudden shiftings of her mind no certain spot she loves but varies soon now the deep shade allures and now the blaze of noon to her with swiftwingd accents youth replied the nymph ye seek fair dame i lately spied in yonder glen which craggy rocks surround whence bursts a torrent forth with roaring sound then bending decent with respectful eye he and his loved copartner hasted by but alma with the prince right onward fared who asked her why to fancy she repaired without her aid said she i want the power to guide thee as behooves a single hour besides her skill has raised a building high which yonder view aspiring to the sky from whence is seen distinctly rock and plain and dell and grot and stream and woodland reign each goodly object all the living race which breathe and move and these dominions grace to which if thee o prince she will convey what else would take up many a tedious day and many a night in vigils to behold in portion small of time she can unfold nor should we happily else succeed at last but after much sojourn and labor vast some thorny glade our tangled feet might chain some wilderness mislead or sandy plain or we might sink beneath some foaming bourn or to the place we left unsped return now where they sought the maid divine they scanned upon a craggy cliff she took her stand forming a gloomy shade above her head a lofty pine it is ample branches spread downward on either side with rapid force from rock to rock a strong stream bent it is course precipitate the dashing currents flow and mingle in one boiling gulf below she stood enraptured over the whirling bay and bathed her forehead in the floating spray conscious of stranger feet her eyes she reared which as the effulgent sunbeam bright appeared and quicker than the quivering lightning glanced then tward them strait with airy feet advanced in prodigal abundance uncontrolled wide waved her burnisht locks of tendrilld gold bread or incircling band they never knew when most dishevelled comeliest to the view in thin habiliment her limbs were dressed a curious robe depended from her vest of fleecy clouds and gossimer intwined which on the bosom of the dalliant wind it is folds sustaining sported far behind adorned with tints of every various die which in heavens glorious bow attract the eye and every blended hue which ever was traced in complicated beauty there was placed often in that vale retired she sat alone where nature wildly strayed to art unknown but circumscribed by no determined bound free and at large she ranged creation round or through the brazen gyre would urge her way with cheek unblanchd and heart without dismay the din of chaos and confusion hear nor all the bickering elements would fear there if she wills the cold abyss she warms new worlds and peopled with unnumberd swarms she bids arise her palace strait they mould she mounts her throne extends her sceptered gold while thronging round her ready subjects stand or stoop submiss and wait her high command then in a moment such her varying soul on ruin bent annihilates the whole assists confusion multiplies the jar heightens the tumult and augments the war for she alone most wondrous to relate except heavens sire is unrestrained by fate often to the empyreal dome with boldest gaze striving to pierce the impenetrable blaze she speeds her course where mid the depth profound of strong refulgent glory floating round sits the mysterious godhead in his reign of trinal unity but all in vain she strives to pass that inexpressive light heavens sire alone escapes her thrillant sight yet she could bring so potent was her sway cherubs and seraphs from the realms of day while gently hovering round angelic quires tuned at her will their goldenstringed lyres or spite of plutos horrid flames would dare to cleave the earth and rouse to upper air the furies with their whips of iron dread the snakes loud hissing on each ghastly head with them would hecate reluctant stand her cypress wreathe display and wield her sparkling brand then would arise on pitchy pinions borne sternlookd revenge hate by wild frenzy torn and each tremendous pest which shuns the light and every child abhorred of ugly night lust fierce and restless jealousy worn blind murder whose features shock the generous mind and pining care which in thick gloomy clouds the halfslain wretch while yet alive inshrouds and woe by inches destined to consume hanging with face all pale over her dead lovers tomb and she would call the unbodied ghosts around uttering their dolorous wail with shrieking sound and witchcraft mumbling forth her rites might make the stoutest tremble and the firmest quake and conscious fear who steals with secret stride keeping close watch the assassins bed beside and when sleep long invoked begins to seal his wearied lids unfold the poppied veil and his tormenting thoughts awhile control rings her alarm wild and rends his guilty soul yet were no frowns or sternness in her face but amiable and clad with native grace her blushing cheeks confessed a modest die blending with softness virgin majesty love ever viewed her in respect arrayed enchanting smiles over all her features played her azure veins in winding mazes flowed the snow above with living luster glowed so decked with radiance decked with beautys beams the eldest daughter of the morn she seems while cordial joy her winning looks expressed to alma thus her speech she first addressed welcome fair maid to this secluded place then sealed the welcome with a warm embrace and hail to thee her knight command the powers who here inherit thee the lightplumed hours transported view for thee each grace will twine the dance the virtues chaunt their airs divine for thee apollos self would tune the lay and i with ready step thy will obey o passing fair to her the virgin said this gentle knight he bent his comely head no son of riot or obstrusive pride to these blithe regions follows me his guide let me his earnest suit to thee commend my strong deliverer he and steadfast friend oh bear him to thy lofty tower with speed or with him through these mazy haunts proceed that he each wondrous inmate may descry and satiate with delight his knowledgegathering eye she answered not but locked with aspect sweet her hand in theirs prepared for voyage fleet then swift as light or if with swifter force aught moves upbore them in her airy course till on the aspiring edifice they stood whence they surveyed that isle it is circling flood the girding heavens outstretchd in vast array and earth and ocean wide which far beneath them lay rare was the building glorious to behold it is parts nor steel nor brass nor lead nor gold nor marble formed nor were they knit with lime with roman cement or asphaltic slime one piece of lucent glass composed the mound in shortest space she raised it from the ground tho seeming thin and frail it braved the rage of wasting time and gained new strength from age with portraits numberless the walls were lined landscapes and histories by her designed for when that tower she left and ranging wide new shapes and forms before unseen descried those from her memorys faithful chart the maid before an artists skilful sight displayed who every stroke with eager rapture scanned and all defined with swiftlymoving hand and ornamented all with colors rare description was her name a virgin debonair soft was her pencil delicately light yet were it is sketches strong and glowing bright for from the clouds their checkered spots she drew and it is pure essence from the morning dew her blush when first aurora rose from sleep she took it is azure from the unruffled deep the smiles of venus cynthias silver ray floras enameled robe the lord of day pouring his splendours in refulgent tide and all dame natures works her tints supplied each color mingling just a reverend eld or seperating each the palette held the wrinkles well became his ancient face low streamed his hoary beard with decent grace his piercing eye his perfect senses told active his soul tho in experience old judgment the sage was styled his looks with awe she viewed his slightest hint she deemed a law full many a time her youthful hand he stayed when wanton or with careless touch it strayed the briton prince with pleasure viewed the pair her curious works and his attentive care till fancy beckoned him to whom resigned he left the enchanting imagery behind and now by her and alma seated nigh where rose the glittering battlements on high she waved her hand then bade them look around and mark the charms of that celestial ground wide spread the magic scene their eyes before the laughing meads with flowers were sprinkled over there was the crocus there the harebell seen the lily fair the rose unrivaled queen the pink the tulip with embroidered vest the violet blue the daisy meekly dressed the cowslip drooping down his languid head all which the sweetest liveliest odours bred and all which natures vivid stains imbrue there scorning art uncultivated grew and mid the valleys lucid rivers stray which rolling on in wild meanders play with dimpled surface now they calmly glide the listening swain hears not the gentle tide now broke by mossy stones sweet music make and the thralld sense in willing bondage take now sudden bounding over some rocky wall from rift to rift the dashing currents fall on hills far off the forests shed their gloom here tufted groves with verdure ever bloom around whose trunks the honeysuckle winds and scented jessamine it is branches binds and purple grapes between thickclustering hung and thousand thousand feathered inmates sung concealed from every eye the minstrels raised their choral notes and harmony was pleased while every leaf more gladly seemed to move and every bough consenting waved above as over the lawns their eyes delighted pass fair flocks they see which croppd the tender grass or slept reclined beside each pastoral stream or wanton sported in the sunny beam and where or rock appeared or rising hill the goats of antic gambols took their fill and jocund keepers with their crooks in hand guarded them both with dogs a faithful band or in the plain or hid beneath the shade on pipes of reed their amorous descants played soon they beheld the horned pan draw near a merry note he tuned the heart to cheer pleasant but rude and rustic was the strain him followed dancing trim in frolic vein a crowd of fauns and satyrs who with fleet and active motions sped their cloven feet with them the looserobed dryads aptly joined their partners gay the mazy round entwined with nimble step they beat the hollow ground their hair with oaken wreathes and ivy crowned a pleasing sight succeeded  lo the god of love a gentle lamb the power bestrod not he for whom spite tempers savage darts teaching those cursed and malignant arts his and his cruel mothers lasting shame while just reproach indignifies his name arts by which numerous wretches first his slaves have sunk in torture to untimely graves and numerous wretches who alive remain dwell with despair and everracking pain this winged boy a milder bosom proved mild as the beast on which he onward moved nor could he see the unhappy drop a tear but he sustained of grief an eqnal share he was not blind and from his piercing sight fled base desire who shrunk beneath his might deceit and calumny his frown dismayed and by him walked sincerity the maid a crystal vase she held before her breast in which her secret thoughts were all expressed each inward sentiment reflecting true clad without varnish in their native hue with this she often can villainy disgrace and make him stooping hide his odious face guarded by this no lurking ill she fears and even assailed a smiling aspect wears as if defended strong by magic charms or firmly girded in vulcanian arms close on the left fair innocence sustained a rosy bread with which that lamb she reind and guided him along the flowery way or checked him if his rider willed to stay her to behold on balmy wings upborne angels would often this lower world adorn bathing in mortal air their limbs divine around her such attractive graces shine her other hand a bloated serpent reared which licked her face for she no venom feared and now a nymph tript over the pathless green blithe was her look unequal was her mien none could her lineaments exactly spy the color of her garment mocked the eye for both each moment changed inconstant wild that fickle female novelty was styled of admiration she the heart possessed her frequent change inflamed his youthful breast with eager look he marked her giddy pace and every shifting feature of her face twisting a silken cord with all his might and stretching each unyielding fiber tight next came a swain and walking by his side one more than kin tho not in blood allied the first was friendship while the other bore the name of sansselflove in human lore honors pure beams illumed his faithful soul in true affection steadfast as the pole for he the former to secure from pain would naked rush on spears or plunge into the main and now advanced the wight they first surveyed and with his spouse that boy in smiles arrayed while heightening all the luster of her charms the little prattler graced her matron arms behind with downcast eye and motion flow trod virgin chastity a lump of snow in her cold hands which tho the tepid west around her breathed no soil or stain confessed unthawd and ever spotless as her breast long since her modest vows and plighted truth fidelity obtained a comely youth her face was his fixed visions only sphere but such his looks as raised no blushes there this hand the flower in living gold displays which to the sun still turns it is constant rays that a cameleon in a diamond chain whose magic links his varying hues restrain and many more from their exalted seat the prince and alma saw a band replete with all that charms the heart or feeds desire stirs the soft wish or warm enthusiast fire uncinctured there the sister graces bright there liberty unveiled her peerless light benevolence and gratitude conjoined beauty alllovely both in shape and mind there heartfelt ease and leisure onward past and happy indolence and peace the last then fancy waved again her potent arm the inverted prospect owned the sudden charm black was the sky the blustering wind blew rude to the gay troop succeeded solitude instead of flowery lawns a doleful glade which seemed for griefs afflicted offspring made tward which no visionary joy could steal alas so soon all human glories fail forth came an hundred nymphs with solemn mien and flaming torches then as seemed a queen by the pure crown of gold which decked her head her awful front and her majestic tread her crimson vestment flowed in stately pride like scythian tomyris when in slaughter died she bade the persian cyrus thirst no more or bold bonduca drenched in roman gore her left hand held a bowl with poison filled which working quick dispatch the victim killed her right a dreadful dagger which to those who tired of life their own relentless foes became she gave or if they asked the bowl she bade them drink and satisfy their soul impurpled buskins on her legs she wore a golden clasp connected them before behind her was a wretch with garments rent he moved as if with weakness all forespent hollow his cheeks and pale his dreary face his eyes still gleaming with a languid grace misfortune he adversity around his passive limbs a brazen chain had bound tho breathless faint oerpowerd and well nigh slain she spared him not but dragged him on amain and ever and anon her arm on high she lifted scouling grim with threatening eye and often his vesture would with fury tear and scourge him till each vital part lay bare no evil word tho hopeless of relief but sighs profound declared his mighty grief she heeded not his virtues or his moan her heart long since had been transformed to stone with aspect sweet and bland a lovely dame the fairest and the best behind him came no rarer mixture of creations mould no purer human eyesight could behold his sufferings when she viewed his dire unrest o god what anguish wrung her tender breast what would she not relinquish to set free from his sad state the man of misery to rescue him she almost wished to die such was the feeling soul of sympathy the tears which sprinkled her celestial cheek with added beauty graced each feature meek as for that wretch beset with cruel pain her eyes let fall the copious drops in vain and blushing pudency there sat inshrined with silent voice interpreting the mind softmantling on the polisht surface played and the moist pearls in orient beams arrayed so in her eastern temple glowing bright through a thin cloud aurora darts her light so a sweet rosy bud attracts the view beneath it is lucid veil of ambient dew two cherubs hovered mild her steps before one in his hand a golden censor bore intent each precious tear of here is to save which filled he straitway to the other gave who to the starry mansions of the sky speeding his purple pinions soared on high where jove with might superior reigned alone except that mercy stood beside his throne the sacred offering he received with love and shook with gracious sign his nectared locks above next came remorse his eyes with looks profound in ghastly silence glared upon the ground but soon retorted with an eager view as if to pierce his inmost bosom through there tenting to the quick with direst pain keen anguish throbbd through every panting vein his arms convulsed sad object of despair he tossed alost or wildly beat the air ah consciencesmitten in thy secret heart deep is the sting and fixed the eternal smart now indignation breathing vengeful ire his sparkling glances darted living fire deep blushed his cheeks with glowing crimson red his manly brow the sternest frowns overspread a glittering falchion beamed above his head yet taught by reason his emotions flow his ire she prompts and gives his cheeks to glow wielding his blade a monster he pursued snaky and foul with venom all imbued guilt who by terror winged never ceased to fly nor tho far off dared turn her craven eye next horror naught his ravin could control with harrows dire twas his to rend the soul to tear each finer nerve with fell dismay to rule with strength untamed and fiercest sway then hopeless love a shaft had pierced her breast her tongue to none the rankling wound confessed beneath her robe she hid the smart severe and pined unwitnest like the stricken deer such numbers owned that queens majestic reign the muse can scarce describe the attendant train in the dark glade they dwelt their native place till now called forth her sovereign state to grace suspicion green and sickly was his hue excess of grief whose eyes no moisture knew revenge who both his hands insteepd in blood envy pernicious foe to all that is good dissimulation weeping to beguile like the scaled reptile on the banks of nile madness wild raving like the stormy wave and melancholy silent as the grave there too was brave disdain of worthless deed and conscious pride from all dishonor freed and stoic rigor which reproach defied and bounteous kindness to the gods allied and seemly zeal by true religion dressed and justice wellspring pure of public rest and emulation scorning second place and wedded love whom wreathes unfading grace and filial piety to whom is given a lengthened term of years by favoring heaven all that from lethargy could rouse the soul all that with potent spell could vice control was there for virtue ranged the bands unseen her vassals they and even their haughty queen from her derived and bound her laws to obey to whose support alone she owes her sway by her she from confusion order draws and rules the diverse crowd with strictest laws now for so fancy bade arose a blast and the dark gloom which erst had overcast the sun dispelled and with it all the crew like the swift rack or misty vapor flew his cheering rays more bright illumed the skies and soon a public road before them lies which tward a neighboring city seemed to lead where many a jovial troop they now surveyed who rode or laughing walked or sung or played by the frequented path an archer stood black was his lowering brow in angry mood two beauteous nymphs within a certain gyre held him softsoothing and restrained his fire satire whom candor meek and truth attend they taught him when his threatening bow to bend at their command the twanging string he drew and with sure aim the barbed arrow flew those whom with deep and rigorous wound he sped by vice an ancient beldam had been bred some in disguises quaint a lurking pest others with open force that road to infest and unsuspecting travelers molest but now with limping pace they trod awry pursued with flouts by grinning infamy and hated kept at distance from the throng nor joined in frolic dance or jocund song but ever when his two companions cast their eyes aside a shaft he snatched in haste and smiling cruel with malicious face struck some of sober mien and goodly grace the virgins when they saw this evil deed to their assistance ran with earnest speed and poured in oil and balm with healing hand but punished him with bitter reprimand not far removed a female they surveyed her easy limbs in flowing robes arrayed loose socks adorned her feet of diverse hue a vizard hid her features from the view an ugly hag who waved a brand of flame followed her steps attending secret shame while ridicule a dwarf still moved before and as he moved a burnisht mirror bore led on by vanity and folly gay the desultory crowd who past that way curious to observe what images were there with idle mirth and wantonness drew near when in the mirror bright themselves they spied but so deformed the likeness they denied till that uncomely dame forsook her stand full in their cheeks she dashed her fiery brand the strong similitude at once confessed they fled disgrace alarmed each conscious breast but oh what tongue what language shall i find what energy what amplitude of mind the scenes which now superbly rose to paint my numbers fail my muse is all too faint when she the prince and alma fair to bless liberal and kind and bounteous to excess unfolded to their sight the rich domains where in full pomp the exalted epic reigns as if a man by more than human power should in his sleep be snatched at midnight hour and over the sounding billows swift upborne behold with wild amaze at break of morn a country strange before with rapid force the amazonian streams unrivaled course beyond an open realm which upward tends and gradual with majestic swell ascends by the vast towering cordilleras bound and on the other side the atlantic waste profound so stood the briton prince in wonder lost for now down timeworn valleys rough embost strong torrents rolling fierce his vision crossed now without shore an ocean huge and deep on which the lingering breezes seemed to sleep but soon dire war conflicting tempests wage and it is chased bosom feels the whirlwinds rage with foaming wrath the watery mountains rise and the red lightning fires the blazing skies now on the champion or mid shady bowers proud castles he beheld and stately towers and clad in sunlike armor many a knight with ladies by their sides of beauty bright to whom they told fair tales of loves delight or in their cause with pointed lance oppose portentous monsters or misshapen foes or in round lists obey the trumpets blast and at their feet each meed of victory cast now heard he clarions numberless around his heart enkindled owned the martial sound and now the plain two bannerd armies fill they march they shout they join they fight they kill undaunted heroes lift the spear and shield pierce the deep ranks and thin the crowded field from steeds and men forth streams a mingled flood the earth is crimsoned with the smoking blood then where the distant mountains he espied moving from rock to rock with giant stride a form appeared his stature reached the pole he grasped at heaven sublimity of soul these past away and now of golden light a cloud he viewed which floated dazzling bright upon a forked hill his eyes in vain strove it is collected radiance to sustain and from behind such music flowed he thought that airs divine from heaven above were brought and whelmed with pleasure scarcely breathed or moved nor was it strange that he such rapture proved when jove himself would often stoop his ear from high olympus top these symphonies to hear through the thin edges of the floating light part of a seeming temple struck his sight of gorgeous frame yet tho he strained his eye it failed the building wholly to descry whenever the central luster was assayed each glance recoiled confounded and dismayed with bold attempt repeatedly he gazed at every look more strong the radiance blazed and now said she o prince whatever these plains can boast whatever the extent of my domains all that my will can grant or thou behold have briefly been displayed those rays of gold thy fair conductress knows the laws of fate will not allow thee yet to penetrate unless when born thou had been sprinkled over with dews castalian and on pindus shore been lapt in myrtle and in laurel green and thrice three times been dipped in hippocrene there on his throne apollo i survey and there the muses tune their deathless lay yet even their mansions shall thou view in time but first must toil in many a various clime and combat with thy countrys deadly foes and crush the saxons with redoubled blows then shall themselves thy partial guides become by whom conducted to yon lofty dome conspicuous thou in glorys fane shall stand and thy renown be read in every land this saying she a private door unbound which led a winding passage to the ground for tho twere difficult the tower to ascend spontaneous and with ease they downward tend when at it is feet arrived with grateful breast the prince and alma their due thanks expressed instant she mounted like an arrowy flame they backward trod the path by which they came ode occasioned by the coronation      i   sleepst thou fair maid aeolian virgin sleepst thou in the cave of drowsy silence all arrayed in indolence supine does listless morpheus wave his torpidstriking wand thy brows around damping thy faculties divine arise fair maid arise shake off the tardiness of dull delay quick bid the sacred lyre resound and tune the harmonious lay brunswick demands the verse prepare thine eagleplumes and light as air sail through the azurevaulted skies i   but first remove far from thy hallowed presence the base train of sawning flattery she to prove her love falls bestial down licking the dust disdain so lowly to debase thine honest head and soil thy verdant laurel crown back to thy shades retire immerge in solitude thy form august thy shining locks with darkness braid still rest in silence if the lust of fame entice thy voice to sing the meanest of mankind a king whom vice and tyranny inspire i   the worthless great to praise befits the hirelings prostituted pen who sells for sordid gold his venal lays though often along the winding seine though often in days of elder date on the green margin of the tuscan stream dazzled by pomps external state the ignoble bard has strung the glozing lyre of specious falsehood yet the british muse freeborn should spurn the illusive theme and fraught with conscious dignity refuse on follys sons to waste her sacred fire or soothing regal grandeur weave for undeserving pride her everblooming wreathe ii   such caution here is vain those numbers fabulously bright are harsh nor charm a brunswicks ear where truth shall point the way tward that unclouded height expand thy purer wings and onward fly directed by her steady ray should meager envy scowl with baleful front and grimlythreatening lance keen arrows from her poisonous eye unmoved thou shall advance smile at her rage without a wound hear her fierce serpents hiss around and all her illshaped monsters howl ii   chaste virgin say where shall begin the song before my eyes so various are the forms which stray that all confused my mind and smit with wild surprise scarce keeps its proper function here behold upon a craggy rock reclined high stretched out over the main despair and horror on her faded brow sits gallia while her arms enfold the anguish of her breast as now wide over the deep she looks now over the exhausted land her humbled power she weeps thick falls the briny rain ii   changed is the scene and here suppliant the savage chiefs of indian race in lowly guise with aspect meek appear the rugged features of their face no more with death and terror clad often wont with wild foot through the dreary shade to range with slaughter often when mad with wrath and hot revenge and stern desire of blood and prey in the calm silent night for soft repose and slumber made have raised the awakening yell of dread affright have basely slain the unresisting sire the babe from it is fond mother tore soon weltering in her own and her loved infants gore iii   well skilled in guile and treacherous as the inconstant air which waves it is fickle

presides over the big tumultuous tides which down the sacred mountain pour and stun the ear with deafening roar yet where more gentle currents stray and through the flowery valleys play laughing with transport as they flow where roses and where myrtles grow her hair with wreathes she often has crowned and scattered her enchanting blessings round i   long in the grecian isles retained by cytheraeas smiles enamored of her rosy hue while frolic pleasures round her flew stole from her lips the nectard kiss and bathed their lightplumed wings in bliss while hebe danced with graceful tread and the soft airs and passions led while sallying from her temples porch young love waved high his magic torch thou too with sweetest look appeared and often thy melodious voice was heard i   have thou forgot the melting strain which taught by thee thy sappho sung when stretched upon the lesbian plain over her the form of tender pity hung did thou not bountifully shed thy visions over anacreons head and even the frozen breast of age in amorous nets and toils engage while all the virgins wondering stood and laughed yet found themselves subdued and when he immaturely died say did not grief thy heavenly beauties hide ii   on what wideseated shore do mortals now thy name adore celestial love thy haunts of old what clouds of sullen gloom enfold how sunk in shades thy influence bright diffusing then it is genial light within the incircled haram reign tyrannic lust and jealous pain bitter constraint internal fears lean anguish and corroding cares unknown are there the mutual sighs which from the sympathetic breast arise ii   thy more than human mien by yellow tiber often was seen and ere the roman eagle flew the sons of britain to subdue with native innocence allied happily thy power did here reside but big with plenitude of woes from the rank earth a pest arose nature his shape with grief espied and for her deathdoomd offspring sighed they sunk beneath an easy prey and love fled far from avarice away ii   did thou then seek columbias strand there thy propitious forehead show while raised by thy creative hand the blooming flowers of social rapture grew too short a time alas from thence did thou thy radiant gifts dispense behold the impetuous monster haste rapine and violence and waste follow attendant on his flight and lo before thy pitying sight weltering in blood thy people lies to cursed gold the fated sacrifice iii   by force exiled ah where did thy insulted steps repair some island in the southern main perhaps enjoyed thy bounteous reign or did thou steer thy vagrant course to orellanas distant source there while in artlessness arrayed the youth beholds his sunburned maid there while of every wish possessed he leans with fondness on her breast thou see them in the palmy grove and ever their heads thy purple pinions move iii   there too the heavenly muse showers perchance her kindly dews while thus some indian horace sings as to his love he strikes the strings ah when you praise my rivals charms his comely neck and graceful arms with passion swells my fervid breast with passion hard to be suppressed my senses float in terrors vain my blood retreats and comes again the tears steal down my cheeks and say with what slow fires i totally decay iii   oh if with me ye gentle powers ye sometimes would but deign to dwell borne by the quicklycircling hours if ye would visit my sequestered cell one who with pure emotion glows who not the face of avarice knows nor by ambition drawn aside but owning nature for his guide who from his earliest day of youth confessed her charms and worshipped truth ye in that secret cell should find and subject to your laws a willing mind ode i   who with ungoverned tongue will blame the verse the eternal muse inspires the soulilluminating flame kindled at heavens own sacred fires who but the wretch of narrow mind whose sentiments are unrefind from the vile dross with base alloy condemning him to plod along scarce elevated over the bestial throng unconscious of each nobler source of joy i   yet tho unto the frigid ear of native dullness every strain of melody uncouth appear and all the gifts of science vain tho dazzled by the blaze of light vice starting turns away her sight from where the muses fix their sway tho cruelty revenge and strife and all the plagues which harrass human life keep far aloof and tread a distant way i   thy sons o virtue with respect sincere bend lowly down before their holy shrine to them they offer up the grateful prayer and bless the influence of the powers divine all who with more exalted thought have wisdoms valued precepts sought all who delight with spotless breast in beauty by the graces dressed all who to bounteous nature just dare her instinctive feelings trust

praise let the halfsould coldblooded friend sneer while affecting to commend let the unfeeling fool laugh loud to you alone the bard his lyre shall strike and quitting every mean desire soar far beyond the falselyjudging crowd ii   hard and unjust the poets fate the intrinsic value of his name while all presume to estimate depress or fix his height of fame empty deceit as if their eye could trace the lightning through the sky pursue the comets devious maze or looking on the blue profound where not the fathomline could ever sound pierce to the bottom with a single gaze ii   ah wretch whoever is destined to possess superior strength and energy of mind unless highseated in a sphere to bless even against their wills perverse mankind else mingling with the common train he speaks to fond selflove in vain the voice sublime of truth is styled extravagant excentric wild for reason on the wings of light upborne eludes their grosser sight and active sense springs tward the distant

choral nine approve or where the sage whose breast disdains the fickle throng the sordid great to those sequestered shades that still retreat where solitude closeleagued with virtue reigns iii   here is are the graces here is the winning charms which the fixed bosom from conviction please from necessary choice within her arms we wish to spend the remnant of our days not so in our first greener years new to this world of vice and cares by flattery taught for what is fame but a delusive idle name which fades before the living breath  though having passed the vale of death she may with vain solicitude return and deck with fruitless wreathes the funeral urn ode i how lives the man whose thoughts obey stern customs arbitrary sway he razes from his abject breast the stamp by natures seal impressed he floats on dissipations tide or cringes at the shrine of pride sees as the crowd directs his eyes or wears the garb of mean disguise unconscious wastes his genial prime still deeper plunged in guilt by time ii when age steals on with tardy pace and bounds fantastic pleasures race no cheerful scene reflection yields but dreary glades or barren fields avarice usurps his tortured mind he loathes the sun and hates mankind on him no pious care attends to him no fond affection bends all view him with indignant gloom and wish him in the silent tomb iii how lives the man whose thoughts have broke imperious customs servile yoke him nature guiding by the hand leads on where truth and reason stand virtue her mantle round him flings and honor waves her silver wings he dares not stoop to foreign laws but wisely courts his own applause health beams delighted from his eye and innocence walks smiling by iv when sinking in the vale of years his head the hoary foliage bears backward he casts his tranquil sight and views each scene reflected bright no sullen damps his joy infest no plagues of avarice tear his breast him willing duty hastes to serve and strains with zeal

thy languid vapors wrap and drooping wings better would thou thy baleful poison shed in some dark cave where the nightraven sings where heavy fits the gloomdelighted owl where aconite its loathsome juices throws where dwells the bat and serpents hissing foul with fell despair who never knows repose there drag the caitiff wretch who has betrayed his trust has ruined innocence or spilt the sacred blood of him who gave him life him torture stern nor will the lovely maid the sweeteyed mercy conscious of his guilt restrain thy hand or blunt thy sharpened knife sonnet ii tho here almost eternal winter reigns and piercing deep the womb of nature chills tho born far off under a milder sky the northern blast even through my marrow thrills and freezes up the lifeblood in my veins the hardy natives over the mountains high trace out the step of health where mid the snow or stubborn heath her feet unsandalld stray hence active nerves and scorn of danger flow hence when of late called forth to mortal fray at their approach revenge more furious grew war smiled while triple rage new steeled his heart pale bloodless fear assumed a ghastlier hue and death more dreadful shook his pointed dart sonnet iii when recollection stirs up in the mind and sets before her eye past scenes of woe in vain the wise their hoarded precepts bring dead unimpassiond written in the flow of health and strength to nicer feelings blind in vain against reflections piercing sting they urge a formal phrase or adage quaint and with a shrewd and wellturnd point of wit or a laborious studied argument think to chase far away the fretful fit they might as well drink the wide ocean dry or rob cold winter of his snowy beard spite of the vain saws of philosophy nature is prevalent and will be heard sonnet iv now is the feudal vassalage destroyed by which the haughty thane his subject train held at his will and arbitrary swayed the crouching throng from fear his lordly reign or with hereditary love obeyed no resolutions of their own enjoyed they bent implicitly to his control now by degrees they find that liberty opens the narrow foldings of the soul erect they stand and boast that they are free no more with rapine they the fields infest or seek out slaughter in her secret den but by the laws of equal justice blessed humanely think and feel that they are men sonnet v here turn thine eyes thou bloated luxury that pamperst thy nice taste with viands rare arraying thy soft limbs in clothing vain sumptuous and delicate and thou shall see with what small reason men like thee complain and how superfluous is thy idle care the shed with uncemented stones built low with flaggy grass or rushes overlaid the fire of humble turf the bed of straw hard by with one sole coverlid bespread thus meanly lives the caledonian sire with his halfnaked progeny around yet joy and calm content his mind inspire and every night he bathes in sleep profound sonnet vi i do not blame these rocks and barren hills this desert wilderness which round me lies wild glens where nature rude has fixed her seat dark heaths over which the screaming eagle flies while the fierce winds my tottering mansion beat for savage pain the worst of human ills tho scenes of pure and exquisite delight were round me cast meadows and fairy groves all that might captivate the wondering sight tho by soft streams should echo murmuring doves tho warm etesian gales should gently play and philomela tune her sweetest voice possessing whom night envies not the day pain savage pain forbids me to rejoice sonnet vii had i but met whence nature bade expect that just return of tenderness expressed that mutual generosity of mind and liberal turn which judging from my breast i fondly thought to others were consigned always reluctant meanly to suspect i should not far far from my native home with numerous cares in my sad bosom pent have hither ever prolonged my wandering tread not willingly but driven by fate to roam i should not then have pressed this cheerless bed to sharp reflection more than pain a prey chewing the cud of bitter discontent where these high hills the lomond lake survey a picture of human life elate with hope and her enlivening fires i rushed impetuous over the fields of youth i gave up all my soul to gay desires and fancys dazzling form mistook for truth she held her magic glass and strait i saw a youth with rare accomplishments endued perfect he seemed nor quickly did i know that struck with wonder of myself i stood when known a transient blush overspread my face selflove soon took the sanguine stain away increased each mental visionary grace and decked each feature with a brighter ray wellpleased the treacherous nymph o youth she cried point thy ideas to the highest aim why are superior virtues still untried why does not worth its lawful honors claim inactive rise lift thy aspiring brow thine be the joys of wealth of power of fame let thy young breast with emulation glow behold the noblest and be thou the same fool that i was with giddy transport blind i swallowed the sweet sound with eager ear my eyes the latent poison could not find nor heart think evil of a shape so fair drunk as with wine methought i could attain to be of each admiring tongue the theme whether i willed the heroic palm to gain or haunt the olive shade of academe whether with love to waste the smiling hours to melt the captived virgins icy breast or wander in the muses roseate bowers weave the proud wreathe and dignify my crest methought my penetrating eye could dart through the black plots and mysteries of state pierce the thick foldings of the human heart and rule with judgements voice the deep debate wildly fantastic the fierce northern blast i might as soon with guiding rein have taught or dryshod over the billowy sea have past as into form have changed unbodied thought ye gay delusions whither are ye fled begot by health on fictions lovely form will ye never gently hover over my head with rapture never again my bosom warm say can thou bid old time with stealthy pace retread the paths his feet have trod before the sun mete backward his celestial race and well again our pleasing dreams restore again from the full fount of lise thy blood swift bursting forth shall swell each turgid vein the enthusiastic spirits in a flood from each strong nerve shall fire thy kindling brain this fate withstands  and reason sternest guide contracts in narrower bounds the excursive view she plainly shows throughout the fleeting tide of life what airy bubbles we pursue by her does conscious diffidence and fear ambitions rage and fancys whims control the flighty purposes to youth so dear and that wild elasticity of soul hence then ye vain ye unsubstantial joys able the selfdeluded foul to bless  yet when alas among lifes real toys shall i such soothing happiness possess ode i assume o vice thy proper hue in thy own native likeness stand soon shall thou find thy subjects few thy throne upreard on sand abhorrent nature with surprise would turn away her loathing eyes ingenuous youth with pain thy monstrous shape would see covered with each toadspotted stain while writhing anguish and pale infamy stalk close behind too desperate to complain ii but cunning as thou art well do thou know the human heart it is intimate recesses lie open to thy wily eye hence thou with many a mimic grace stolen from the virtues as of old unconscious of an enemy so near always open and sincere ever with decent freedom bold they stripped themselves to lave beneath a grot in the translucent wave have decked thy odious face iii thy unsuspecting lover thinks them true of cloudy vapors made a thousand dazzling forms parade before his cheated view a thousand pleasures move breathing mirth and social love some with quickdoubling feet and winning smiles advance in the mazy circling dance and then with more alluring step retreat iv others on waving wing such notes of lively transport sing or varying now their strain with such dying melody complain that guided by the enchanting sound and swallowed up in hearing every sense the fated victim over the magic ground straying without defense his careless progress takes till lost among inextricable brakes or in the midst of some wild heath forlorn he finds himself at last hears nothing but the wintry blast which all his idle moanings flouts with scorn v fatigued and spiritless he lies nor dares from the cold earth to rise night closes in  ah where art thou celestial hope thy face the darkness shrouds  oh through the quickdisparting clouds appear and by the moons clear ray let him behold thy placid brow faithful companion of thy way by his golden lance well known and firmingirding adamantine zone bring resolution in a purple vest by the young unfledged moments dressed vi oh raise him in your arms and while his veins yet flow with life while any strength remains bear him away with swiftest course for should sleep on him steal and with it is dew his eyelids seal not even an immortal force could open them again no more shall he behold the sun of virtue pour it is radiance from the morningsky black mists shall round him ever fly or he shall fall from some steep mountains brow overwhelmed by the deep flood that roars below the madness of aspasia abhorred forever be his name who snares for candor lays and branding innocence with shame the virgins faith betrays who practiced in destructive art her thoughts sincere arraigns and tho his image fills her heart of cold neglect complains then while she feels the quick alarm seizes the unguarded time honor and loves emotion warm and glories in his crime such cynthio and aspasia were in pride of earliest youth a victim sunk the generous fair to his dissembled truth palled by possession tho her soul was worth a kingdoms price yet all it is charms could not control the hardened slave of vice tho on her bosom well he knew what pangs would urge their force pangs which their sharper tortures drew from virtues native source but vengeance sure tho now defied shall harrow up his mind that mercy which his soul denied shall be from him confined the grief which to her sire befell his agonys excess no pen no other tongue can tell a father only guess let us said he my friends proceed to where the afflicted strays oh may our cares at least succeed to give some transient ease let us her bosoms rankling wound with tender pity fill or sit in silent woe around as the mute mourner still but lo she darts across the green spare spare my tortured sight  before my eyes this hour had seen why closed they not in night her face i view distraction there  i read it in her eye that glance bespeaks and that wild air extremest misery she opes her pallid lips  oh worth o ruined excellence thy unconnected thoughts pour forth and reave me of my sense i have been to yonder wood to gather flowers there on a bank so steep i saw him lying fast asleep i stole on softly to the bowers no ear my silent step could hear for why should i awake or cause him from his dream to start but a fierce snake my footsteps did pursue i nothing of it knew and springing on me eat out all my heart see what a frightful wound ah no it cannot now be found so i snatched up my flowers in haste and round my head have traced but they are too bright and gay as i wear them in my hair they make my complexion more faded appear away away away yet i have been as fair as they  but should they be betrayed  deprived of their bloom they would sink down to the tomb and be pale and wan like me be sure with them let my hearse be dressed and strew them over my earthy bed where i shall shortly lie when the cold turf supports my head i will take my fill of rest the sunbeams gay and fine shall see no grief of mine nor the worm hear me sigh but i pray you secret prove tell it not to my love nor let him that way go  for should he come in and see me look so thin his heart would burst in two no  he has quite forgot he says he knows me not now in my misery and will you believe him too has madness seized your mind tho you may think him true the faithless seas and wind are not more false than he methinks i cannot but smile that he should you beguile  i heed not what he says but stop up my ears and am deaf to his prayers in vain his flatteries he displays and tells me i am fair as the newfallen snow that my keen eyes have pierced him through that me alone he loves  no no when once deceived beware fool that i was i thought him true  oh snatch him snatch him from my view  yet ye tormentors set him free give him his liberty the pain his conscience brings is worse than all your racks of steel your whips and cruel stings i know what he must feel  he swore so holy was his flame that i should never know a pleasure or a woe but he should feel the fame so bid the bridemaids come i will be dressed all in white  well take the damask room  it is long before it is night  what say you lost it is all a jest it is not yet quite dark he stays till i am undrest  is that the morning lark not yet returned where fled where fled alas i knew it well i knew that he was dead although you would not tell i am wondrous cold my hands are clay  my blood in frost is bound  yet force me not away well lie in the same spot of ground under this marble stone i shall enjoy him all alone oh help my friends her accents low her interrupted breath and these convulsive strugglings show the quick approach of death and are there powers in heaven above will they this sight behold then pensive virtue fearful rove exulting vice be bold the ebbing tide of life fleets fast alas she breathes no more  her mortal pilgrimage is past and mine will soon be over elegy from spenser when first before my youthful eyes i saw the form of damon move i gazed upon him with suprise but not one thought had i of love my soul grew fond of fancies vain tetchy and froward naught could please yet knew i not what gave me pain nor thought it love but some disease soon as the beauty of the sky night had defaced with pallid hue striving to sleep i down should lie but sleep away far from me flew instead thereof sad sighs and fears about me cruel watch maintained forth gushed the involuntary tears and sorrow then triumphant reigned if any drop of slumbering rest into my weary soul distilled what frightful dreams would then infest what horror through my bosom thrilled then up i from my bed should start and all my former grief renew think on that image in my heart and all its heavenly charms review all night a stranger to repose to ease a stranger all the day no sports no company i chose to solitude a willing prey thus cared i not abroad to spread youths plant when in its fairest prime but let it all neglected shed both fruit and flower before its time alas should this be love i cried too late the fatal cause i found in vain each lenient art i tried too deep had pierced the rankling wound nor other cure had i for grief but my hard fortune to deplore to languish like the fallen leaf and feed with plaints the impoisond sore thus tward the silent grave i paced thus by degrees decayed my frame till by the long and lingering waste i like a pined ghost became inscription for an arbor enter of welcome sure beneath this shade ye sacred few whose eyes can see with scorn the pomp of luxury who unseduced can leave behind the citys noisy hum and smitten with the charms of innocence pleased with the lowly glen and verdant lawn the leafy covert and secure retreat can hear

fancys vivid train wit which art could never enchain and friendship of ethereal mould hating meanness hating gold prudence hence it loathes to trace the features of thy simpering face thy sobermeasurd gait to spy and leaden joyforbidding eye prudence hence thy laws i scorn thou of mean deceit art born by sly hypocrisy begot noble frankness heeds thee not yet tho all my sallying soul expatiates wide and hates control tho my thoughts unbridled dare forward fly in wild career in their most impetuous course let me reason prove thy force tho thou totterst on thy throne let me call thee still my own for so mad i would not be as quite to lose the sight of thee ode no ye beckon me in vain your allurements i disdain powers of riot god of wine though thy glistning forehead shine through the garland which around is so negligently bound tho joy lighten from thy eye tho the purple goblet high with nectar foam on thy right hand tho the soul of pleasure stand and wit and unlaced gaiety which with

embraces i disdain on the dead sparrow of lesbia from catullus o venus o ye loves bewail and all who finer passions feel dead is the sparrow of my fair the sparrow who her tender care who her excess of fondness proved whom dearer than her eyes she loved for he the sweetest mind possessed conscious by whom he was caressed he never from her endearments flew not she her mother better knew but leaping round in wanton play twitterd to her the livelong day now goes he to the gloomy bourn whence no one ever may return perish ye fatal shades who spare nothing that is either good or fair now have ye snatched with ruthless mind the best and fairest of his kind o impious deed from cheerful day to force the little wretch away for whom my girl finds no relief her swelling eyes are red with grief to sleep where are the downy slumbers fled which hovered nightly over my head and soon as i my pillow pressed closed my eyes in sweetest rest by wakeful love forbid to stay alas too long ye keep away o come ye vagrant slumbers spread again your pinions over my head o long uncheard my sweet repose again my fainting eyelids close elegy the truest love is most reserved and shy no look of confidence or boldness wears known by the humble brow and softened eye and full of wavering doubts and anxious fears when i perceived that thespia had overcome my yielding heart and fixed her empire there that from her hands i must receive my doom and all my future weal must flow from her how did my bosom fluctuate with the pain of native bashfulness and strong desire what varying conflicts did i not sustain how struggled soft respect with passions fire often did i wish the secret to have told but awe withheld and modest dread prevailed her presence all my faculties controlled and every settled resolution failed at length with firm intent i sought the fair with firm intent to pour out all my heart at once display the story of my care and the long misery of consuming smart to a sequestered grove her steps i drew she without guile went innocently free no ill suspecting for no ill she knew nor feared to trust herself alone with me at first my usual converse i assayed hoping from thence to gain a tranquil air and as along the winding path we strayed with frequent blossoms decked her flowing hair but still my shortened breath fast went and came over my embarrassd limbs a stiffness hung my heart throbbd strong and shook my laboring frame and fears i knew not how unnerved my tongue resolved to speak some secret power restrained ashamed and angry with myself i grew with crimson consciousness my cheeks were stained and quick again the conscious stains withdrew she whether observant all the while or else this strange confusion to relieve talks with her wonted ease and careless smile but brief and vague each answer which i gave then changed my fickle will it is first design determined sudden on some future day then would i each perplexity entwine and every ardent wish before her lay a transient calm succeeded in my breast yet sure thought i they were not so concealed but she the emotions of my heart has guessed she too may happily wish they were revealed though now my faultering tongue its aid denies she must have read the language of my soul nor have i marked displeasure in her eyes when forth from mine the glance of love has stole then turning round in haste as if afraid lest diffidence again might intervene not daring to erect my timid head my hesitating lips disclosed my pain elegy in nothing was i learned but only how to pen my flocks and drive them to the field in the strait furrow to direct my plough and when my hoe and pruninghook to wield uncultivated was my mind and mean my abject thoughts low fastened to the earth till love with hand benign brake customs chain and bade me soar beyond my humble birth with beauty fired i looked around and saw the charms of nature never seen before o love a willing vassal to thy law i bend i feel thy blessings and adore prompted by thee as yet with trembling tongue i called the muses and desired their aid my woodnotes in the hazel copse i sung and caught the attention of the listening maid she listened to my strains she heard my tale while deepening blushes over her cheeks arise the soft consenting sigh my lips inhale i see the yielding languor of her eyes no witness truth if ever i estrange this grateful heart which only beats for thee  why utter needless vows i cannot change fixed are my bonds nor will i ever be free fixed is thy gentle sway by thee my mind avarice and all its sordid acts disdains the common vice of passion unrefined the common vice among our country swains hence stinging cares hence grovelling they behold the state of riches with an envious eye they think not aught beyond the power of gold nor know how love can lift the soul on high oh come my fairone i have thatched above and whitened all around my little cot i have shorn the hedges leading to the grove nor is the seat and willow bower forgot low is the path of life in which i move yet will thou not regret the higher sphere of wealth and noisy pride while faithful love and innocence and sweet content are here elegy still blooming health thy modest graces shed over the clear surface of my thespias cheek there let thy fresh thy glowing tints be spread thy smiles enlightening and complacence meek protect her where she goes ye gentle powers pure denizons of undulating air whether from glowing noontides sultry hours or evenings dewy shades protect the fair it is true my thespia i indeed confess that selfish are the prayers and vows i pay with no disinterested voice i bless the gods or pour the supplicating lay for ah from thee and from thy looks i find warm to my heart each cordial joy must flow sweetening the ills of life from thee my mind must taste its keenest sense of piercing woe thine is the masterkey each spring to rule each hidden movement of my secret thought sure thou were bred in some enchanters school who all his spells and mystic charms has taught yet then would holy truth with thee reside truth which unbounded confidence may trust yet then would mean deceit fly far aside and wild caprice confounding false and just wouldft thou have said as i struck dumb with fear tremblingly pointed out my humble bower happily tranquillity and peace are there for them i scorn the gaudy farce of power o thou sincerest how shall i repay the endless debt of gratitude i owe quickly my fair point out to me the way and show the path for thou alone can show tho silent is thy tongue thy speaking eye the modest blushes over thy cheeks which rove that deepdrawn breath that panting breast reply the sole return is tenderness and love will this suffice and do thou ask no more what the spontaneous feelings needs must give oh let me lavish on thee all my store nor cease to love thee till i cease to live for ever rivetted within my heart thy dear unsullied image shall remain when from that seat i bid it to depart may i by some tremendous stroke be slain no common death i shall deserve to die to pine by inches on a barren strand scorched by the vengeful suns severest eye nor by one sportive wandering zephyr fanned to freeze on some bleak rock to glut the rage of howling beasts within the dreary waste or live in youth despised in helpless age the extremities of want and woe to taste to walk a moving plague among mankind shunned hated and refused the alms i crave refused despairs last only wish to find a still retirement in the peaceful grave in that fond hope to be deceived to hear with soul yet conscious in the churchyard way the fierce invective cast upon my bier and scornful laughter dancing over my clay all this and more i shall deserve to prove when led by changeful fancys wanton eye i turn a faithless truant to thy love and on the wings of vagrant falsehood fly elegy ah whence my thespia can that anguish flow that silent anguish of expressive woe that sigh which from thy struggling bosom stole that look which pierces to thy inmost soul ah say my thespia i conjure thee say to me the hidden cause thou may display half of thyself i claim my lawful share yet would to heaven that i the whole might bear unveil thy thoughts in confidence to me and trust a bosom fraught with sympathy from thee would i my laboring heart confine and are not all its deepest secrets thine wretch that i am am i who thee from pain to shield would pour out life at every vein am i the cause and could thou ever spy a look of coldness glancing from my eye to thee a cold blank look oh too refined and subtle error of thy feeling mind a delicacy apt too deep to dive to each nice touch to tenderly alive though i esteem it as a blessing sent as the more polished minds chief ornament a sacred spark kindled by heavens own ray yet let not sensibility betray thou weepst where did my tongue profanely rove how could i blame thee twas excess of love o let me circle thee with strict embrace warm breast to breast and glowing face to face my fixed lips while speechless rapture ties imbibe the lucid moisture of thine eyes thy melting spirit in each breath inhale gaze on thee till the nerves of vision fail and quite oerpowerd by loves imperious sway feel all my fainting soul dissolve away elegy what have i done what crime in me is found what secret evil lurking in my breast that while all nature else is smiling round heaven has on me it is heaviest stroke impressed have i ever dropped a wish of others harm or done an ill tho never to be revealed have i not always breathed the emotion warm on the chaste lip of social virtue sealed ah is it not enough that far away from my own native happy fields i rove far from each friendly name condemned to stray and torn by cruel force from her i love but must through her the barbed steel be sent which piercing with severest torture wounds shall she i love convey the punishment which justice must confess exceeds its bounds on me rain all your woes ye righteous powers though hard i will strive the misery to bear view sickness steal away my lingering hours on tainted wing nor drop a pining tear but ah the gentle virgins tender frame  o brighthaird chastity o angel truth if ye are aught beyond an empty name save save in pity innocence and youth shield shield me from the racking thought i spy from her cold cheeks the bland suffusion fled dead is the piercing magic of her eye the lustredarting beam of sense is dead she calls on me  oh snatch the last embrace woods rivers mountains countries intervene oh curse of curses never that lovely face again shall i behold even the last scene some dreary satisfaction might afford some solace to the madness of despair gloating in secret on his gloomy hoard with eye intorted viewing what is there amyntas an elegiac poem      the strains of young amyntas when disease preyed on his frame and hopeless of relief with anxious soul he struck the solemn lyre i give to those whose feelings like his own unwarpd by dissipation or the touch of morbid sensibility are true to genuine pity who like him retired far from the world but not with him condemned to share the bitter cup still love the tones pleasingly sad which nature prompts to flow nor selfish from affliction turn their eye nor scorn the impassioned muses hallowed lay thus in his secret haunts he struck the lyre and thus in solemn note the strains began hail ye sequestered rocks ye pines which shed your melancholy horrors over my head ye scenes where solitude unfolds her wings and silence still as death around her flings not that i invocate your darkening glade to pour upon my mind a deeper shade superfluous were your help to wake the strain of grief when feeling nature bids complain when stern reflection speeds her arrow keen and piercing tells me thus thou once have been no in the regal dome of festive pride where luxury expands her banners wide where noisy riot and unthinking mirth and the whole brood of folly take their birth cheerless would sit the wretch overwhelmed with pain and even a sirens note would charm in vain yet hail for here i may without control indulge the sad emotions of my soul into this lonely place the insulting eye of curious impudence will fail to pry from the false voice of harlot pity free here i may give a loose to misery here i may drag my languid seet and slow here i may lay my drooping limbs full low on the cold ground in wild diffusion spread nerveless my arms and unsustaind my head why was i born or why did i not come a blasted embryo from my mothers womb cursed be the moment when the midwife smiled and hailed her parent of a living child yet i accuse not heaven i lived i grew and seemed as nursed by it is descending dew with joy and health through childhoods paths i ran with joy and health through youth rose up to man yes in the strength of rosy health arrayed i have trod with active feet the verdant mead elate and conscious of her genial glow with active feet have climbed the mountains brow when the highmettled blood with loosened reins fiery and hot rushed bounding through the veins when every nerve with quick sensation fraught each touch sound sight to the warm seat of thought bore swiftly and with pleasing stamp impressed when sweet content selfnurtured in my breast fixed her abode from whom goodnature sprung she tuned each gentle accent of my tongue spread over my cheeks her mild complacent air my forehead smoothed and laughed at angry care rather be cursed the day when in the pride of youth and prodigal of strength i tried my limbs beyond what prudent nature gave when i with foolish emulation brave tortured each tendon every nerve to gain a bootless victory on the grassy plain not used to share the wrestlers hardy deed not formed to bear away the athletic meed thence the cold sweat which now bedews my limbs thence the damp mist before my eyes which swims the hoarse weak voice and interrupted breath each anxious presage of approaching death which terrifies my mind it is powers decayed no longer in it is wonted robes arrayed of constancy of firmness ere i die reason seems dead and dull fatuity threatens her vacant throne oh dreadful thought better have never been better be naught than just with sense enough to see and rue the dismal change to drag on life and view blighted by sickness harsh and wintery frown each intellectual blossom falling down each intellectual fruit which late so fair put forth by health and youth the balmy air promised to ripen to look round in vain for gay imaginations vivid train the quickwingd thought which gathering knowledge flew from earth to the blue arch of heaven or drew whenever she pleased from her own secret store sweet entertainment oped the hidden door most difficult to open and beheld herself in naked entity revealed what tho the luster of these eyes is gone these eyes which once could gaze upon the sun when in the center of his noontide height he poured redundant his strong beams of light what tho these nerves through which in gladsome tide i felt the genial happy spirits glide with cold obstruction pine i had not cared if firm my mental eye if my soul shared it is pristine warmth nor should corporeal pain however tormenting urge me to complain yes worse than racks or fire it is to find erased the loved ideas of the mind yet still surviving over gods earth to stray a mere mechanic piece of moving clay tho even this perchance i might have borne had not from out my suffering breast been torn her generous offspring wisdom of the head had not the virtues of the heart been dead i might have spared but where alas is now that instantaneous sympathising glow which when anothers sudden good was known i felt like lightning over my bosom thrown oh i remember at the tale of grief my loaded heart in tears has found relief in purest drops from pitys genuine source now self engrosses all now self by force weighs down the nobler passions in their stead suspicion peevishness and gloom succeed fain would i fly from their detested sway tho often rebellious still i must obey my soul is harrassd out with anxious care and each unfriendly passion harbors there ye maids of memory who benignly bright oped your gay visions to my youthful sight led by whose retrospective power i strayed through darksome shade or sunny lawn and played with wildeyed fancy while at her command a thousand winged ideas rose and fanned with light capricious plume my glowing face ye maids of memory wrapped in whose embrace i have spent all day and all the livelong night nor wished so ravishing was the delight return of morn as over your sacred page i hung enamored while with eager rage i swallowed as it were your magic lay ye maids of memory to whom i pay even now faint adoration for no more is left to pay each rapturous thought is over the blaze of love which kindled in my breast when to my wondering eyes you stood confessed witness ye maids of memory how my soul expatiated then no mean control shackled elastic thought no straightened sphere it is efforts circumscribed was even air allpiercing air more free then did i live then could i pleasure take then pleasure give then dwelt i with the gay or with the grave but now my soul is an imprisoned slave she strives indeed for freedom but in vain so dark the dungeon and so strong the chain with thee too god of wine and of delight attentive to the voice and happy flight of inexpressive humor i with joy have often sat not thee with vile alloy of frontless ribaldry debased but thee where on each side of genuine liberty stood the fair forms of decency and sense they ordered social gayety dispense her blessings widend friendships raptured heart bade into life each generous feeling start awakened native genius all around sincere colloquial intercourse was found communion sweet of souls alas the hour is come when i no longer own thy power mirth what art thou to me an empty name i own it tho i blush a crimson shame society i hate i shun the way of converse as if there infection lay far at a distance by myself i go for loneliness well fits the soul of woe nor can i bear to be despised when seen conscious i am not what i once have been the world must know the same i feel i feel contempt more piercing than the sharpest steel her everrankling wound no balm can cure the pain no mortal flesh can long endure i have not been despised the listening ear has wished again my ended speech to hear not that i asked respectful awe to find but more had gained the love of humankind by those who fully knew me most carest by those who knew the secrets of my breast i have not been despised the partial eye of beauty has on me been cast the sigh has heaved the bosom of the pitying maid when i the sufferings of my heart displayed the hidden grief which preyed upon my frame the secret fears and illdissembled flame ah why was there to me a soul just heaven susceptible of tender passion given why did my eyes which scorned the pomp of gold enraptured beautys angel form behold catch the quick glance imbibe the gentle smart and pour the grateful frenzy over my heart while still my mind with higher notions fraught and a more noble dignity of thought spurned each base impulse nor to gain alone corporeal charms desired but to be one one soul with her i loved to immingle there this this i cried is only love sincere when wishes passions sentiments agree for such as these ethereal harmony starts from her sphere and ravished at the sight dwells in their presence with supreme delight the joys these only know these only prove the feelings worthy the blessed name of love thus while i spoke around my youthful head delusive hope her flattering pinions spread sprinkled her magic dust before my eyes and bade as true the airy visions rise each soft domestic bliss methought was mine for me did cordial amity entwine her everflorid wreathe o vainly blind now i perceive the folly of my mind to plan down aught in this uncertain state yet who could trace the mazy steps of fate no for me never shall burn the nuptial fire no prattling infant ever shall call me sire while sitting on my knee my warm cheeks glow and my fond eyes with tenderness overflow a solitary being to the tomb i must descend snatched in lifes early bloom a solitary wretch nor shall a tear of wife or child wash my funereal bier nor when times mellowing hand shall bring relief and lenient years have soothed the pangs of grief with pleasing melancholy shall reflect upon my words my actions recollect and keep my memory in their hearts awake with thus my husband did our father spoke alas why flow these murmurs from my mind when fair religion whispers be resigned resigned i will be for resign i must  but till these limbs are mingled with the dust till my soul takes it is flight and cold and dead this corpse is with it is brother reptiles laid nor is that time far off with listless pain the wasting evil creeps through every vein till i am no more within my faithful breast the stamp by natures cunning hand impressed will still prevail if i were so inclined i cannot forget that i am of humankind still must look back and idly wish to stay still must look forward shuddering with dismay still must regret that i in vain was born and weep that i must sink in early morn like a young oak in all his towering pride scathed by the lightning on the mountainside what art thou death whose horrors can appall the daring wicked and the virtuous soul can terrify the coward and the brave feared by the free man feared too by the slave if by thy aid when bursting from it is clay the soul soars upward to perennial day mixes with angels in the blessed abode hymning heavens king itself a demigod why does not nature gladly view thy face and yield with pleasure to thy kind embrace why armed with an imaginary sting shrinks she beneath thy overshadowing wing why thanks not her deliverer from strife and hails thee death the harbinger of life ah why thou thinking substance if thy flame from heaven and earths immortal father came equal in kind tho not so in degree particle of the eternal deity art thou to this vile mould so closely tied in chains of such strict unity allied as if on it thou solely did depend it is birth thy origin it is death thy end as grow it is members thy sensations grow as flow it is juices so thy spirits flow by age or sickness as it is nerves decay thou seem to languish fade and die away an inmate of a cott joyous and strong while gentle gales the summer hours prolong but when the stormy gust and wintry flaw pierce through the crazy door and roof of straw shivering and cold and sad confined at home able nor willing over the fields to roam and when a whirlwinds rage or torrents fall shakes over thy trembling head the ruined wall overwhelmed thou lie or by the furious stream swept clean away like a forgotten dream ah hold i stand upon a mountains brow and dark and deep is the abyss below reason recoils and upward casts her eye where cherub hope sails through the azure sky transparent is her vest and from her wings strongbeaming rays of steady light she flings joined hand in hand with faith she flys along faith ever blooming ever fair and young than fabled hebe she more blooming far her graceful head with a rependent star majestically crowned aloft they fly the lovely pair nor can my dazzled eye pursue them farther than to where it is sight is overpowered by the effulgent light of heavenly radiance issuing from above yet sacred strains of rapture and of love break on my ear and the sweet thrilling sounds soothe my sad soul and ease her smarting wounds help me ye powers from out that soul to tear each mean each grovelling thought which harbors there to mount on high your shining track pursue till heaven unbounded bursts upon my view

the youth he is dead the virtuous soonest die the deathsong of ragnar lodbrach king of denmark ragnar lodbrach flourished in the ninth century and by his piratical expeditions according to the custom of his countrymen rendered himself the terror of the northern parts of europe after having carried on his depredations with success for many years he was at length taken prisoner by ella king of northumberland whose coasts he had invaded and put to death by him being as was reported cast into a dungeon full of serpents his melancholy fate stimulated his son ivar to avenge it and on this occasion the famous standard of the raven is said to have been embroidered by his sisters and consecrated with such magic rites as insured victory to those before whom it was borne under this standard ivar made a descent on the territories of ella fought with vanquished and put him to death in his turn  the following poem if we may credit tradition was composed by ragnar in his horrid place of confinement it is apparent however that it must have been the work of some scald or bard probably to do honor to to the memory of his deceased king to place before the eyes of his subjects his heroic achievements and urge them and his son or sons according to the poem itself to revenge  it is preserved by olaus wormius in his book de literatura runica while the frequent return of the same images and expressions shows the authors unacquaintance with the nicer rules of composition he exhibits a species of savage greatness a fierce and wild kind of sublimity and a noble contempt of danger and death if for no other reason this epicedium is valuable as it doubtless affords a lively picture of the manners and sentiments of the northern nations  the death song of ragnar lodbrach i with our swords resistless might we have thinnd the ranks of fight in early life his volumed train the crested serpent rolled in vain thoras charms the matchless prize gothland saw my fame arise thronging crowds the monster scan shouts applausive hail me man all his fierceness prompt to try the shaggy vestment clothed my thigh soon transpierced in death he lay my falchion smote for splendid pay from this first exploit as the story goes ragnar obtained his surname of lodbrach i e rough or hairy breeches for the king of gotland having promised his daughter thora to the man who should kill a vast serpent which wasted the country ragnar undertook the enterprise and dressing himself in the skins of beasts with the hairy side outermost throw water over them the cold to which he purposely exposed himself forming round him a suit as it were of frozen armor he met the serpent whose teeth had no effect on this impenetrable mail fixed him to the ground with his spear and ripping him up with his sword tore out his heart after the victory the king presented him his daughter and on account of his rough dress gave him the name above mentioned by which he was from that time distinguished  olaus magnus relates this adventure but says he fought with and killed two snakes that the king had taken them when young and bred them up as a guard for his daughter but as they increased in size they became a public terror and poisoned the country  such is the fabulous beginning attributed by bards and historians to the actions of ragnar lodbrach his subsequent adventures seem however better founded and carry no marks of sable till we come to the last scene when the manner of his death is as wonderful and incredible as his first appearance    ii in prime of youth we steer our course tward

rock to rock a strong stream so cd its way which there was blent in one accoiled band she joyant stood over the foaming bay and bathed her forehead in the floating dewy spray xxv when as the tread of stranger feet she heard eftsoons her eyes she thitherwards enhauncd which as the glitterand sunbeam bright appeared and quicker than the quivering levin glauncd and strait toward them with light step advauncd her goldentendrilld locks down from her head hung loosely wavering as to them bechauncd she never them confined in tie or bread but they most comely seemed when most dishevelled xxvi in thin habiliment she was bedight of cunningly inwoven gossmer twined most curious was that garment to the sight and on the lap of the soft dalliaunt wind which it sustained disported far behind its color was of every various dye which in the glorious bow of heaven we find and every intermingled shade the eye could ever ken was there in vast complexity xxvii in that retired vale oftimes she sat where

will she ever would pursue for she alone most wondrous to relate except highreigning god was uncontrolled by fate xxix often to the heaven of heavens she would ascend and through the impenetrable blaze would try boldly her peering vision to extend and into the mysterious godhead pry where far above the staryflaming sky his seat is circled deep with glory bright in his trinal triplicity trinal triplicity alludes to the three times three i e nine orders of angels which were supposed to stand before the throne of god forever praising and magnifying him on high but never could she pass that lustrous light highreigning god alone escaped her thrillant sight xxx yet sich her sway that she to earth could bring from their eternal steds angelic quires who round about her gently hovering tuned at her will their goldenstringed lyres or maugre dernful plutos grisly fires would cleave the earth and rowse to upper air the furies with their whips of iron wires and snakes loud hissing in their troubled hair and hecate at her call would her dread front uprear xxxi with them all ills would rise that shun the light sternlookd revenge hate by wild frenzy torn and each abhorred child of ugly night lust ever restless jealousy oerworn mean murder of each generous mind the scorn and pining care which in her sickly plume inshrouds while yet aliv the wretch forlorn and woe whose heart by inches does consume hanging with face all pale over her dead lovers tomb xxxii and she would call the unbodied ghosts around with shrieking note uttring their dolorous wail and witchcraft mumbling forth her rites profound might make the stoutest living wight to quail and conscious fear who secretly does steal keeping close watch beside the murderers bed and when sleep gins his tired lids to veil and wrap the poppied pursle over his head rings her alarm wild and rends his soul with dread xxxiii yet nothing was there fearful in her face or terrible to the beholders view but in her was an amiable grace a lovely and a modest blushing hue which mingled with respect loves passion drew and winning smiles her features freed from scorn and ye might read her straying veins quite through her alabaster skin and so adorn she looked like the eldest daughter of the morn xxxiv now she the gentlest alma first addressed welcome fair virgin to these blissful bowers then tenderly did clasp her to her breast and hail to thee sir knight can aught the powers who here inherit aught the winged hours the graces and the virtues thee to please for thee to please beloved of heaven no stowrs they would refuse apollos self would seize the occasion and myself thy servant am always xxxv o passing fair alma to her replied this gentle knight the knight full low did bend no impe of riotise or boastful

air swift as the levinbronde or if than it can swifter thing be connd darted upright ne did she stop ne stay till on her lofty espial they did stand whence they the girding heavens might survev and earth and occan wide which low unneath them lay xxxvii it was a noble work for to behold for neither was it built of stone ne lime ne was there irn ne brass ne lead ne gold ne roman cement ne asphaltile slime to bind the parts and knit withouten rhyme but it was all one piece of lucent glass and edifyed by her in shortest time yet though both thin and seeming frail it was no work on earth could it in lastingness surpass xxxviii with rare imagined portraicts it was strowd landscapes and histories by her designed for what she saw when raunging far abroad she took her flight and left thilke tower behind that from the store house of her heedful mind she would display before a painter fair who every form with skilful hand defined and fetisely bedight with colors rare description was her name a virgin debonair xxxix her pencil was most delicately fine and light and strong the sketches which it drew and beautifully did her colors shine for the clouds checkered tints she in them threw and the first drops of pearly morning dew auroras blush too when she first did wake from venus smiles from cynthias silver hue from floras mantle from the greensea lake and all dame natures works she did her colors take xl a reverend eld the palette there did hold and every color set in proper place his piersent eye his perfect senses told the wrinkles did become his ancient face and eke his hoary beard hung down with grace judgment he hight his precept she obeyed for he could teach her every stroke to trace full many a time her youthful hand he stayed when wantonly or when through carelessness it strayed xli the briton prince with curious regard the labors of these busied twain did see till fancy calling him away debarred his eyne intent on that imagery forthwith to her his step he hasted free tho he and alma seated by her side on a high battlements extremity she waved her hand then bid them thrown wide their looks toward the right and see the countrys pride xlii they looked and beheld a country rare the laughing meadows were with flowers bespread the rose their shining queen the lily fair the cowslip drooping down his fainting head the pink and tulip gay embroidered daisies and violets and all the crew which sweet impunging smells odorous bred or nature with bright stains did imbrue there sdaining touch of art uncultivated grew xliii and here and there did murmuring rivers stray flowing entrailed in meanders clear now all so smoothly making gentle way with dimpling surface that though placed near the swain their progress onward ne might hear now broke by mossy stones did hoarsly brawl and prisoner took the willing thralled ear or bounding over a ragged rocky wall from rift to rift in many a cascade did fall xliv and up and down were many tufty groves lifting their heads in glory flourishing around whose trunks the honeysuckle roves and scented jessamine is wandering and purple grapes hung thickly clustering and thousand thousand feathered songsters lay concealed and melodiously did sing while every bough and every treeen spray waved their consenting leaves and gladlier seemed to play xlv and on the flowery meads and plains they spy fair flocks of sheep nibbling the tender green or ruminating as adown they lie or wanton sporting in the sunny sheen and where or rock or rising hill is seen the frisking goats their antic gambols made and jolly keepers both did keep from teen who in the open sun or secret shade tuning uneven pipes their amorous descants played xlvi soon did they see where from a grove issued the goatfoot pan playing a merry fit pleasant it was but rather rustic rude him followed dancing trimly to that dit a crowd of fawns and satyrs who with flit and active giambeaux beat the hollow ground while with them hand in hand their partners knit the looselyrobed dryades rebound their hair with oaken wreaths and palm and ivy crowned xlvii they passed on and next most pleasing sight the god of love borne on a gentle lamb not he who armed dire by savage spite and taught those cursed arts which sure i am have with disgraces shent his cruel dam and als himself and crowds of wretches slain with whose sad carcases the grave to cram and crowds of wretches who alive remain have murd up with despair and evergnarring pain xlviii this winged boy a gentle mind did bear as gentle as the beast which him upbore ne could he see the unhappy drop a tear but it would make his breast with pity sore and he himself would weep and grieve therefore he was not blind and from his looks did fly the horrid face of lust embossed with gore and grovelling mean deceit and calumny and by his side did won the maid sincerity xlix before her breast she bore a crystal vase in which her inmost thoughts were all portrayed that ye each hidden sentiment might trace with this she often has villainy warrayd and made him stooping hide his felon head guarded with this she fears no secret harms but walks secure as tho she were arrayed in strong defense by force of magic charms or girded firm with coat of mail and scaled arms l on the other side holding a rosy band with which that lamb she guided in the way or when his rider list him still to stand did softly check his pace and mildly sway wended fair innocence her to survey the angels would from heaven on balmy wing gliding in mortal air their limbs embay in the other hand a serpent with fell sting she held which licked her face ne any scathe did bring li the next a nymph her countenance displayed blithe was her look unequal was her air her lineaments

light heart inflame and looking on her greedily he onward came lii behind them one twisting with all his might a skein of silk which in his hand he bore yet tho he always strained it full tight no single thread would yield or break therefore a swain who friendship hight in human lore and by his side another goodly swain called sansselflove of mind most firm and sure for he that other to secure from pain would naked rush on spears or plunge into the main liii and now advanced the wight whom first they met and with her babe that spouse so fair to see to him full firmly bound in wedlocks net and eke that other pledge of mutual gree and close behind was virgin chastity bearing in her cold hands a lump of snow which though the warm west winds around her flee received no impuritie or flaw ne ever lost its white ne ever would it thaw live long time she had betrothed bin i ween unto a comely youth of mickle praise fidelity full steady was his mien his eyes on her engrafted were always yet sich their look they ne might her displease this hand a golden sunflower did sustain still turning to the sun her constant rays that a cameleon in a diamond chain which him ins native hue for ever did restrain lv and many more whom time to tell would fail the prince and alma from their airy height might see with thilke same bevy fair to fail there passed by the sister graces bright and liberty unveiled her peerless light benevolence and gratitude ysere beauty all over lovely to the sight there heartfelt ease and leisure ever dear and happy indolence and peace brought up the rear lvi then fancy waved her hand but oh how strange what at that potent motion ensued alack a day how sudden was the change black was the sky the blustering wind blew rude instead of company was solitude instead of gladsome sights a doleful glade in which no cheerful vision might intrude for luckless plaint as it beseemed made ah woe is me so soon all human glories fade lvii forth came an hundred nymphs with solemn tread and flaming tedes in hand and then a queen as seemed by the crown upon her head of beaten gold and her right royal mien her eyes with aweful dignity gave sheen her crimson vestment flowed in stately pride which likest scythian tomyr was seen when stained with persian blood she cyrus eyed or bold bouda when in roman slaughter died lviii her left hand held a bowl with poison fraught which working quick dispatch was sure to kill her right a dreadful dagger sharply wrought which to the wight who list his blood to spill she gave and bade him execute his will or if the bowl he chose to end his days she stooped it down and told him drink his fill impurpled buskins on her legs she wore which with a golden clasp yclasped were before lix behind her was a wretch with garments rent hollow his cheeks and pale his dreary face he moved as tho with weakness all forespent yet not uncomely was his weary pace and his eyes gleamed with a languid grace misfortune hight him in a brazen chain adversity most cruelly did brace and tho he seemed faint and well nigh slain she nould him ever spare but dragged him on amain lx and ever and anon her arm on high she would uplift which with an iron whip adawd and scowl on him with threatening eye and oftimes would his clothes with fury strip and to the bones the skin therewith would rip that he poor man would miserably groan yet not an evil word would he let slip his virtue she not heeded nor his moan her heart hand long ygo transmewed bin to stone lxi behind him came with sweet aspect and bland the fairest and the loveliest maid i ween that ever yet on earthly mold did stand or ever was by mortal eyesight seen when as she viewed that misers doleful teen o god how did she lift the heavy sigh what would she give he might relieved been for him she could almost with pity die so feeling was the soul of tender sympathy lxii her beauty showed more lovely for the tears which all besprinkled had her face most meek as for that wight beset with cruel fears in vain they ren down over her heavenly cheek and blushing pudency sat mantling there darting her beams the pearled moisture through so seemingly enshrined as does appear through a thin cloud aurora to the view or a sweet rosy bud through the clear ambient dew lxiii two little cherubs did before her fly one in his hand a golden censer bare which underneath her face he did apply and therein latched every precious tear which filled he gave up to the others care who to the throne of all oerswaying jove plying his purple plumes aloft did steer he thilke same offering received with love and shook with gracious sign his nectard locks above lxiv next came remorse his haggard eyes down bent in ghastly silence glard upon the ground but soon inflected inwardly were sent as if to perse into his breast profound there as tho tenting to the quick a wound would wring his hands in agony of pain or wildly toss them in the air around ah foredone wight thou but turmoilst in vain the sore full deep has fret and ever shall remain lxv now indignation with his eyes on fire welding a glitterand faulchion over his head his red cheeks blushing with becoming ire his stern brow frowning with a comely dread for ay he was by reason maistered he with that faulchion fain would do to die a snaky monster foul illfavored guilt who distraught with fear away did fly nor tho at distaunce got dared turn her craven eye lxvi next horror harrows in his hand he bore with which he felly harrowed up the soul and all her finer senses rent and tore so that his ravin she might not control but he there reigned king and kesar sole and hopeless love a shaft quite through her heart had passed the wound she wrapped in her stole still struggling to conceal her deadly smart and like a stricken deer pined away apart lxvii and many more attendant on that queen their resience in thilke dark glade did keep there wonnd suspect her face all sickly green excess of grief from whom no tears could creep vengeance who both his hands in blood did steep envy to her own mind the kestrel slave dissemblaunce who like crocodile could weep madness as wild as the enchauffed wave and melancholy silent as the midnight grave lxviii there too was brave disdain of deed that is base and there of tried spirit conscious pride and emulation which no second place would grant and mercy to the gods allied and stoic rigor which all vice defied and seemly zeal by true religion dressed and wedded love which death cannot divide and justice wellspring pure of public rest and filial piety with heavens first promise blessed lxix all that might rowse the soul of man was there all that to goodness might his bosom sway and rescue him from vices perlous meir for virtue marshalled all in just array that queen herself does her behests obey to her from first her origin she owes ne without her could reign a single day by her she order from confusion draws and all that diverse crowd acts as she gives them laws lxx and now at fancys bid began disappear the darksome dreriness which erst had blent the sun of heaven and hid his beamez clear and with it all that forseen many went while he his chearing rays more clear outsent and now a public road before them lay it seemed as there was some city near for many a goodly troop passed by that way some rode some laughing walked some sung and some did play lxxi close by the road an archer took his stand his lowering brow announced vengeful ire two female forms were seen on either hand who him restrained within a certain gyre with sober counsel smothering his fire candor and truth but he was satire hight they taught him against whom he war should stire and when they pointed out the destined wight he drew his bow and him imperst with arrow bright lxxii those whom he so amercd with rigorous wound by an old beldam had been bred a pest yclped vice some in disguises found others more openly that road to infest and unsuspecting passengers molest but now did halt with limping pace along while infamy sat grinning on their crest they joined not in dance or jovial song but shunned and hated skulkd at distaunce from the throng lxxiii nathless when as his two companions cast their eyne aside he would with motion sly a shaft from forth his quiver snatch in haste and with insatiable cruelty at travelers of goodly grace let fly which rueful scathe when as the virgins scanned to their assistance renning hastily they poured in oil and balm with healing hand but him with threats affrayd and bitter reprimand lxxiv onward a little space there wonnd a dame behind a vizor she aguisd her face socks on her feet she had as her became and her loose garb fell down with easy grace always attending constant on her pace a selcouth hag a flaming brond who bore her name was secret knowledge of disgrace a dwarf hight ridicule was placed before who a large burnished mirror stead of target wore lxxv into thilke mirror led by vanity and folly vain their semblaunces to view most of the silly crowd who passed by with idle mirth and wantonness nigh drew but so deformed did they therein show they nould confess themselves to be the same until that hag sprung from her hidden mew who dashed into their cheeks her brond of flame and they retreated thence all covered with shame lxxvi but oh what tongue what language may suffice with ample spirit fitly to express the scenes that potent queen now bid arise my simple numbers cannot aptly dress in meet array ne yet their glory guess when she the briton prince and eke his guide with liberal kindness bounteously to bless unfolded to their sight ne yet envied the regions where the lofty epic does reside lxxvii as though by power past human from his bed in nightly sleep a wight should snatched be and cross the sounding seas be hurried then waking in the morn with wonder see himself in an unknown and strange country before the amazons huge flood latefound beyond an open realm uprising free by the vast towering cordilleras bound and on the other side the atlantic waste profound lxxviii so in amaze the briton prince was lost for now down deepsunk valleys rough and steep huge rapid streams rolling his vision crossed now without meir an ocean wide and deep on which the lingering winds did seem to sleep but soon with angry mood a whirlwind blew no longer might it now its calmness keep but all with foamy wrath enraged grew and from the fouldring clouds the levin gaunt outflew lxxix now on the champion ground he might behold castles which seated were in pleasant site and single knights armed in glistring gold with ladies by their sides of beauty bright to whom they told fair tales of loves delight or else for their protection combating with monsters fell courageously did sight or in round lists each other conquering to them the trophies of their victory did bring lxxx now heard he braying trumpets numberless the martial blast did his bold bosom thrill eftsoons two large enraunged armies press the plain they shout they join they fight they kill and the engorged earth with carnage fill tho saw he where the mountains rose on high striding from rock to rock from hill to hill a giant form whose head arraught the sky among the stars empight his name sublimity lxxxi these done away a cloud of blazing sheen floating upon a forked hill appeared the brightness well nigh blent his feeble eyes and from behind sich music was there heard he thought himself to heavens height upreard and the great weight of pleasure scarce could bear ne wonder was it that he sich rapture shared when jove himself would often stoop his ear from high olympus top thilke harmony to hear lxxxii where the thin edges of that cloud did reach he might as twere part of a temple see but though he strained his eyes to the utmost stretch they nould its shape distinguish perfectly yet it most gorgeous seemed for to be but through the middle of that cloud so bright from whence issued the dulcet melody he could by no means cast at all his sight the oftener he looked the stronger blazed the light lxxxiii and now said she o prince what to thy view i might disclose thine eyes have briefly seen so much was to thy fair conductress due to perse that dazzling cloud thou see i ween thou must all over have besprinkled been when thou were born with dews of castaly and thrice three times been dipped in hippocrene there on his throne apollo now i see and there the muses sit each in their just degree lxxxiv yet even these thou shall behold in time but first thou many hardy fights must wage and travel over many various clime and with thy countrys deadly foes engage and curb the saxons haught with strong menage tho they themselves shall take thee by the hand and to that building with safe tutelage conducted thou in glorys fane shall stand and thy renowned name be read in every land lxxxv this saying she a privy door unbarrd which led a winding passage to the ground for though to climb up to that tower was hard down to descend was always easy found when they now touched the bottom of the mound many great thanks gave alma to that dame and eke the prince with humbless most profound she
