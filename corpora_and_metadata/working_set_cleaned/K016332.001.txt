the delicate distress a novel in letters  in two volumes  by frances  vol i  lamour ne peut jamais subsister sans peine dans une ame delicate mais ses peine memes sont quelquefois la sourcede ses plus doux plaisirs recueil anonym dublin printed by brett smith for the united company of booksellers mdcclxxxvii  to his grace the duke of bedford sir if a private suffrage could add fame to a public character i shoud be the foremost to express my opinion of your graces merits for they who speak thy praise secure their own but as a compliment is always intended in an address of this nature i shall assume the sole honor of it to myself by declaring to the world that i am one of the many who have reason to subscribe myself  with respect and gratitude your graces very much obliged and most obedient servant frances  preface the following work is submitted to the perusal of the public with infinite timidity and apprehension as it is a species of writing which i had never attempted before from a consciousness of my dificiency in the principal article of such compositions namely invention  the generality of novelreaders may therefore probably be disappointed in not meeting with any extraordinary adventure or uncommon situation in the following pages while persons of a more natural taste will i flatter myself be rather pleased at finding the stories and incidents here ralated such as might for i affirm they did and most of them to my own knowledge certainly happen in the various contingencies of real life  but though i have not attempted to feign any fable i acknowledge that i have endeavored to conceal some truth by changing scenes and altering circumstances in order to avoid too marked an application of the several stories and characters to the real persons from whom i have taken my drama we have no right over other persons secrets come they to our knowledge through whatsoever medium of intelligence they may  accident confers none and confidence forbids it  as there is no fictitious memoir here ralated neither is there any factitious moral displayed to the incredulous reader amongst all the various sentiments of this recital i write not of puppets but of men i have endeavored to describe the feelings nay the foibles of the human heart such as we are naturally conscious of in ourselves but meddle not with the wires of the floicks which only render us machines by helping us to perform a part of which we have no sensation  i know not whether novel like the epopee has any rules peculiar to itself  if it has i may have innocently erred against them all and drawn upon myself the envenomed rage of that tremendous body the minor critics  but if i have spread a table for them they shall be welcome to the treat and let them feed upon it heartily  sensibility is in my mind as necessary as taste to entitle us to judge of a work like this and a cold criticism formed upon rules for waiting can therefore be of no manner of use but to enable the stupid to speak with a seeming intelligence of what they neither feel nor understand  labbe troublet in his essays on literature and morals says  si un ouvrage sans defaut etoit possible it ne le seroit qu a un bomme mediocre and in anothet place  il ny a rien de plus different qun ouvrage sans defaut and un ouvrage parfait  i shall only add that i sincerely wish the subsequent pages had fewer faults to exercise the good or ill nature of my several readers but i must now throw myself and my book with all its imperfections on its bead upon the indulgence of the public from whom i have received many favors and to whom i am a truly grateful and  most obedient servant frances  the delicate distress letter i lady woodville to lady straffon tell me my dear philosophy wise sister why those gloomy mortals styled moralists take so much pains to put us out of humor with our present state of existence by declaring that happiness is not the lot of man etc etc do they think these dogmas enhance the value of felicity as unexpected blessings are mostly prized or is it that themselves soured by mortifications and disappointments which their vanity or caprice have occasioned they are unwilling to acknowledge that degree of perfection in any state of being which they do not themselves enjoy but why do i argue where i can at once confute by declaring your emily blessed to the utmost extent of her most romantic wishes and feeling if possible an addition to her felicity by knowing that you share it  our journey was delightful even the sun which had not appeared for some days shone forth on us in its full luster creation smiled the gladness of my heart gilded every object i thought the birds sung hymeneals and i was sorry when even miss westons fine voice interrupted their still sweeter notes my lord was  himself i cannot say more to express all that is tender elegant and polite  lady harriet who you know is of the gentle kind looked assent to our happiness yet frequent sighs escaped her why should she sigh i have heard people say they do so from habit without sensibility or sensation time and use may possibly work such an effect but this habit must certainly have its rise either from sickness or sorrow perhaps lady harriet may be in love if unhappily so how truly to be pitied  it is impossible i should yet be able to give you any idea of this fine old seat nor do i think i shall ever attempt it i had much rather you should see than read its beauties i hate flourishing descriptions modern writers overdress nature as ill judging women do themselves they give her parterres for patches hanging woods for lappets and embroider her beautiful green gown with all the colors of the rainbow i flatter myself that your taste for it is elegant will approve whatever my lord has planned and i shall not insist much on your admiring the works of his ancestors the closet in which i am now writing is charmingly situated it commands  but after what i have just said let me command my pen  my lord ever kind and attentive to me wrote to his sister lady lawson who lives eight miles off to defer her visit till this day as it was probable i might have been fatigued with my journey he speaks with such extreme tenderness of this lady that i begin to love her already by anticipation  but hark her carriage rolls into the court yard and my heart steps forth to meet her but returns again to assure my dear fanny that i am  her truly affectionate sister e woodville  letter ii lady straffon to lady woodville may my dearest emily ever continue an exception to those opinions which notwithstanding her present felicity have too surely their foundation in this worlds experience the bitter ingredients of life are however more sparingly scattered in the potions of some than others and i believe there may be many who have passed through life without feeling one natural misfortune  but then these favorites of heaven unworthy of its bounty are apt to create afflictions for themselves and mourn over ideal for want of real distress  this is a failing i am not at all apprehensive of your falling into at least for some years to come but as i have ever acted as a mother to my dearest emily or at least endeavored as far as it was possible for me to supply that loss to her infant years let me now with the same maternal tenderness warn her against the contrary extreme that of being too much elated with her present joys lest whilst she clasps she kills them  and now my emily a truce with moralizing which i confess would have been improper at this era but that you brought it on yourself and i only appear in the character of the slave who attended the triumphs of the roman conquerors merely to inform them they were mortal gracious heaven that such an information should be necessary to any of thy frail creatures but i find myself relapsing and will learn from you to command my pen  poor lady harriet i am sorry she should have cause to sigh for i agree with you that sighing may be incidental but not accidental i hope the gay scene of receiving and returning visits etc in which she will be engaged with you may help to dissipate the cloud of her chagrin i rejoice in the acquisition of your new sister she must be amiable if lord woodville loves her what a compliment to my emily but let it rather make her grateful than vain  i fear i shall not have an opportunity of approving my taste by admiring lord woodvilles improvements for some time sir john who is not a little jealous of your not having mentioned him purposes going for a couple of months to paries do not grow jealous in your turn i do not intend to accompany him to that gay scene which would have fewer charms for me than the rational and rural pleasures of woodfort but i design to inoculate my little edward and emily during his absence i shall not acquaint him with my intention till it is over i know he wishes it done and i would spare him the anxiety of a fond father upon such an occasion i know too he will be vastly obliged to me for laying hold of this opportunity for it is an invariable maxim that all men hate trouble of every kind and choose to be out of the way when there is any disagreeable operation to be performed  my sister straffon who you know is to be married to sir james miller has determined to take her chance with my children she says she could not answer it to her conscience to marry sir james who seems to be enamoured of her face till she has put her features beyond the common danger of an alteration i went with her last night to ranelagh  as she said to take leave of it i hope but for a short time  the attention of the whole assemby was taken up with a beautiful foreigner the marchioness de st aumont i think i never beheld so much vivacity and sweetness joined before in the same countenance i have just looked up at your picture and thought it tacitly reproached me for having so soon forgot my emilys face i will look again her eyes have more vivacity i must confess but yours a greater sweetness hers are black yours are blue the advantage which each of you have over the other in this particular may be more owing to color than expression  the marchioness has been a widow about a year and does not appear to be above twenty i am certain that if i were a man i should be in love with her i am glad she has left paris before my straffon goes thither  you may read strephon if you please i shall take care to keep him out of danger while he stays in london or perhaps she might keep him sighing at home and so mar both his scheme and mine the very best of these men my dear emily have hearts nearly resembling tinder though they would have us think they are made of a sterner stuff  a sparkling eye sets them all in a blaze  lady sandford who doats upon foreigners has already engrossed her perhaps she may engage her to go with her into the country if so you will probably meet her at york races and if that should happen it will be absolutely necessary for lord woodville to arm himself capa pie with constancy and for you also to rivet the joints of that armor with unaffected complacency cheerfulness and love  lucy and sir james miller are in the drawing room i fancy she is tired of a teteatete as the fondest lovers sometimes are for she has just sent your little namesake to request my company i must therefore quit you to attend her summons i shall expect a particular account of all occurrences at woodfort as the most minute matter that relates to you must ever be of consequence to your affectionate  frances straffon ps as i have yet time enough to send my letter i shall acquaint you with the occasion of my being called from it lucy had just informed sir james that she intended to be inoculated he opposed it with the utmost vehemence and told many stories upon that subject to intimidate her in vain she continued firm to her purpose  he then entreated that they might be married before the operation and he would give his consent to her undergoing it in ten days after this she absolutely refused and i think with good reason the altercation grew warm on both sides i was chosen umpire and gave my opinion in favor of lucys arguments sir james said i was a partial judge and quitted us soon after with some little warmth  i was sorry to perceive a starting tear in lucys lovely eye and rallied her on being lowspirited she confessed she felt a kind of foreboding that the union between sir james and her would never be accomplished and yet said she had not the least apprehension that her death would prevent it i told her that i foresaw nothing else that could as her beauty was even less in danger from this experiment than her life  she replied that they were both of them but transient blessings and she had happily brought her mind to such a state of resignation as to be fully prepared for the loss of either but she owned that she had not yet accustomed herself to the thought of resigning sir james however if she was to lose his affection she could better sustain that affliction bofore marriage than after  here her eyes streamed again and while i was endeavoring to dissipate these gloomy vapors sir john luckily came in to the relief of us both as it put an end to the subject of inoculation which i told you before he is not to receive the least hint about for the present but lucy and he are affectionately yours and rejoice with me in your happiness  once more adieu and good night  f straffon    letter iii lady woodville to lady straffon my dear fanny i did not insist upon the permanence of human felicity i said only that there was such a thing as perfect happiness and i hope with a truly grateful heart acknowledged myself in possession of that rare treasure however your letter has given a little alloy to it and rendered it less pure and unmixed  i feel for you on your childrens account and for lucy on her own she has long determined on inoculation she mentioned it to lady harriet before i was married and made her will the day after she became of age i admire her fortitude but fear i should not be able to imitate it  your description of the marchioness is really alarming and has already made me jealous not of lord woodville but of lady straffon if you should ever become acquainted with her she will certainly rival every body but sir john and the dear little ones perhaps lucys heroism may still preserve her some place in your heart but the poor absent emily will be totally forgotten when you already begin to stand in need of her picture to remind you of her  my lord and lady harriet both knew her in paris and both agree that the charms of her person are inferior to those of her mind and that she was still more admired as un bell esprit than as une belle dame will not you give me credit for the utmost generosity in furnishing you with this account of my rival that is to be  i hope she may come to york races that i may have an opportunity of examining this phoenix with a critics eye but it shall not be like the modern ones who are generally so intent on spying defects that they are apt to overlook the most striking beauties this however may sometimes proceed rather from a want of taste than a spirit of malevolence and i am always inclined to pity those unhappy people who never seem to be pleased  charming lady lawson what an engaging countenance what a quick sensibility in her looks what an irressistible smile i am not under a necessity of looking at my bracelet to remind me that this portrait resembles lady straffon but lady lawson is taller thinner and more of the brunette she is two years younger than my lord and has been married six years to sir william lawson who seems to be what they call a jolly goodhumoured man he hates london loves fox hunting and has they say no exception to a cheerful glass or a pretty lass i fear poor lady lawson was thrown away though sir william is generally esteemed what they call a good husband he behaves outwardly well to his wife merely because she is so and would have treated her chambermaid in the same manner if he had happened to marry her what a mortifying situation to a woman of delicacy  the meeting between her and my lord was truly affectionate and tender she had not seen him since his return from making the grand tour she thanked him in the most graceful manner for increasing her happiness by ensuring his own and she also hoped that of so amiable a person she was pleased to add as lady woodville my lord replied that if any thing could add to his felicity it must be her approbation of his choice which he was certain would increase with her knowledge of his dear emily he then joined our hands bowed and withdrew how kind in him to be speak her favor for me but i shall endeavor to deserve what she seems so ready to bestow  lady harriets dovelike eyes glistened with pleasure at her cousins politeness she said there was a nearer relation between lady lawson and me than what my lord had given us for we had kindred souls  here the arrival of a great deal of company put an end to all conversation is it not surprising sister that where there are most words there is generally the least sense and yet it is always the case for i never remember to have met with any thing like rational discourse in a company that exceeded five or six  lord and lady withers their two daughters the eldest a fine woman and once intended as a wife for lord woodville the point had been settled between their fathers but the death of old lord woodville happily for me left the son at liberty to choose for himself she appeared to be in some confusion when he saluted her and i felt myself a good deal distressed on her account  women are not such wretches as men misrepresent them conquest i own is pleasant but i detest a triumph it sinks one methinks below the vanquished her sister is pretty young and modest i think the whole family amiable and agreeable  sir harry ransford and his lady  what a pair he old gouty and peevish  she young handsome and vulgar his son by a former wife polite and sensible with a wellmade genteel person my lord and he were intimate abroad i wish he would fall in love with our dear lady harriet nay he certainly will do so i cannot possibly see how he can well avoid it  mr watson mr young mr haywood etc what a crowd you would have pitied me fanny though i have been four months married i was so bebrided and wished joy that it made me downright sad lady lawson was very useful to me in assisting to entertain the company she has in her manners and address a great deal of that graceful and courtly ease which i always admire in others without having ever been able to obtain in myself but all farther endeavors after this perfection are henceforward at an end with me and i hope now to be able to preserve my mauvaise bonte during life for after twenty it is rarely to be overcome without paying too dear for the conquest  in the afternoon the younger part of my lords tenants appeared in the avenue neatly dressed and adorned with all the honors of the spring and forming a long dance together my lord proposed our going out to see them i found this had been designed as there was a large carpet spread on the lawn and seats already prepared for us  when we were seated they passed by in couples chanting a rustic hymn in praise of hymen and strewing flowers before me at length they presented me with a beautiful and fragrant wreath which i immediately placed on lord woodvilles brow while the villagers retreated singing and forming themselves into a rural dance infinitely more agreeable to me than any of the grands balets at the oppera or theaters we left them at their sport and returned into the house  after tea my lord proposed our following the example of his merry peasants this was readily assented to by every one but sir harry ransford who told us he never lay within ten miles of his own house after the twenty fifth of march and insisted upon lady ransfords going away with him that instant as he said they should hardly be able to reach home by his usual time of going to bed at nine oclock summer and winter  we all entreated that he would permit lady ransford to stay which he peremptorily refused saying it would be setting an ill example to the bridegroom to let women have their way she said every thing in her power to prevail but when she found it in vain and that he would force her away she was provoked at last to call him methodical monster he replied that it was better to be one by his own method than hers and hobbled into his coach she followed with the face of a fury what a delightful teteatete must theirs be  mr ransford staid and danced with me i think him the best dancer i ever saw our little ball got the better of all disagreeable reserve and at supper we appeared like old acquaintance perfectly at ease and quite cheerful my lord was in remarkable good spirits and even lady harriet seemed gay the withers are a charming family both the young ladies play on the harpsichord and sing finely  we had an agreeable concert the next day they staid till late in the evening sir william and lady lawson went home this morning we are to return their visit tomorrow mr ransford is still with us he is a great lover of music i fancy there is not much harmony in his fathers house and where the instruments of a matrimonial concert do not found in unison the discord is most grating  i shall long impatiently for every post till i hear that all your patients are out of danger lucys presages with regard to sir james are only the effect of low spirits i never saw any man i think more in love than he appears to be i cannot however bear the thoughts of his consenting to her being inoculated ten days after their marriage selfish wretch i dont let lucy see this paragraph  i have now shown my obedience to my dear motherly sisters commands by entering into a minute detail of every thing that has passed at woodfort i am disappointed at not having the pleasure of seeing her here yet i highly applaud the disposition of that time she promised to bestow on  her affectionate e woodville ps sir john has no reason to be jealous while i can with truth declare i love but one man in the world better than him    letter iv lady straffon to lady woodville i am much obliged to my dear emily for the entertaining detail of her amusements in the country i am charmed with your account of lady lawson and am not like my dear spoiled child the least inclined to be jealous i thank you for the flattering likeness you have drawn of me may there be a still stronger resemblance between us in our love and esteem for lady woodville  i think you extremely happy in meeting with such an amiable friend in so agreeable a neighbor she will i doubt not be kind enough to inform you of the carte du pais where you are situated and what is of infinitely more consequence to your happiness she may acquaint you with the particulars of her brothers temper for be assured all charming as he is that he has some the knowing and treating of which properly may be the surest basis of your future felicity  sir john set out for paris last monday and in an hour after mr ranby inoculated lucy and my dear children though i have the firmest reliance on the goodness of providence and the fullest conviction of the general success of this opperation the mother could not stand it i was forced to retire to my closet i repented my not having acquainted sir john with my design and thought that if any mifortune should happen to either of the children even his grief would seem a constant reproach to me  in this situation of mind i poured forth my soul in fervent prayer before the throne of mercy my apprehensions vanished the rectitude of my intentions confirmed my resolutions and i felt myself perfectly calm and resigned amazing efficacy of true devotion but indeed my dear emily there is no other resource for the afflicted no other balm to heal the wounded soul by this and this alone we are enabled to triumph over pain sickness distress sorrow even death itself  the children are in a fine way and have received the infection lucy it is thought has not she insists upon being inoculated again tomorrow sir james supped with us on sunday night and told us with a grave face that he should not see us again till his affair was quite over for if he visited here he could go no where else i laughed and bid him stay away if he could  though i did not think him serious he has hitherto kept his word but sends a formal card every day to enquire of our healths i see that his behavior hurts lucy though she affects not to take notice of it i hear he spends all his time with miss nelson she is artful and agreeable i begin to fear poor lucys presage may be verified  adibu my dearest emily i shall not write to you again till i can congratulate you on the perfect recovery of our invalids till then and ever i am  most affectionately yours f straffon  letter v sir ja thornton to lord woodville the devils in it if the honey moon is not over yet and you near half a year married this is carrying on the farce too far and looks as if you wanted to make us infidels believe that pleasure was to be found in the sober and virtuous scheme of matrimony  i allow your wife to be handsome i will suppose her lively and agreeable too but then have you not had time enough to be tired of all these perfections and whenever that happened the more merit a woman has the greater our dislike  i should never forgive a wife that did not supply me with a reason for hating when i grew weary of her but i fancy i need not be in any manner of pain on that account for the preciou creatures have generally a quantum sufficit of foible and caprice to answer that end at least all those i have ever conversed with appeared to be compounded of nothing else after one months intimate acquaintance  you will perhaps tell me that lady woodville is a very different kind of woman from those i hint at it may be so and i will admit it but prithee harry is she not your wife and in that comprehensive term are not restraint care limitation of pleasures and squalling brats included but love her if you will and as long as you can but believe me the only way to keep such a sickly flame alive is by the fuel of absence  therefore order your horses directly and leave her where she should ever remain sixed to the freehold while you shine forth once more among your old friends at the shakespeare i write this by order of the society from which you will be excluded if you do not appear upon this summons from  yours etc j t  letter vi from lord woodville to sir james thornton dear thornton i received your lively letter but wish you had chosen a fitter subject to display your wit upon than the old commonplace topic of matrimony were i not perfectly acquainted with your writing as well as your humor i should have thought your letter a counterfeit you are no libertine thornton and yet seem to take pleasure in adopting their gross and contemptible sentiments  their general abuse of women is truly rididiculous they pretend to know them without having ever conversed with any but that unhappy species of them whose minds and manners are a disgrace not only to their sex but to human nature itself profligates first betray to infamy all the women they can deceive and then by a double injustice judge of the sex from the examples they have made  but come my young friend and convince yourself that happiness is to be found in a virtuous connection with an amiable and agreeable woman order your horses directly i say and leave your gross errors where they should ever remain in covent garden  i never was a member of any society at the shakespeare though i have spent some evenings there both pleasantly and innocently i love cheerfulness wit and humor wherever to be met with and when sir james thornton shall be added to our society at woodfort i shall not have occasion to go in pursuit of any of them elsewhere as a farther inducement we shall go to york races i know you have horses to run there hasten then to yours sincerely  woodville  letter vii lord seymour to lord woodville my dear lord i arrived in london the day after you left it how unfortunate to have missed the friend of my heart to whom i have a thousand things to communicate that will not bear the cold slow forms of narrative letter writing  but one sad truth i must pour into your bosom from mine that almost bursts while i repeat it the lovely the angelic charlotte beaumont has fled from these fond arms and taken refuge in a convent i beheld her renounce the pomps and vanities of that world which she was born to adorn none but her kindred angels ever appeared so beautiful as she when led like a blooming sacrifice to the altar  as she advanced up the isle she caught my eyes she stopped and sighed but quickly recollecting herself turned here is to heaven  then with a ray of that ineffable tenderness with which we may suppose angelic beings look on mortal woes she turned them full on m  t ah too soon recalled them and passed along with all the dignity of conscious virtue  how i got out of the convent i know not my senses vanished with her   was fifteen days delirious and but for the officious kindness of wilson should not now feel those poignant agonies that rend my heart o woodville to lose such a woman by my own folly that fatal duel in what misery has it involved me when i am calm enough if that should ever be i will copy her last letter and send it to you i would not part with the original for worlds though it has destroyed my peace in this  will you forgive your wretched friend for breaking in one moment on your present felicity i hear you are completely blessed  this is the only ray of joy that ever can or shall pervade the gloom in which my fate is involved happy woodville to triumph over an unhappy passion and now to feel the transports of successful love  but let me entreat you as you value your future peace not to see the marchioness your wounds are not long healed and may all bleed again she is a true calypso therefore my friend shun her ensnaring wiles and remember you are accountable for the happiness of an amiable and innocent young woman  what a bleach of honor even to hazard it  this single consideration will i am certain be a more powerful preservative to your generous heart than all the philosophic reasonings in the world which too well i know were never yet proof against strong passion  adieu my friend that you may continue to deserve and possess every happiness this world can give is now the warmest wish of your unhappy  seymour  letter viii lord woodville to lord seymour my dear unhappy friend i am truly sorry that i had left london before your arrival  had you given me the least hint of your intentions to return i should certainly have staid to meet you and i would at this moment fly to pour the balm of friendship into your wounded bosom but that sir james thornton whom i have invited to spend some time with me at woodfort and go with me to york races came here last night  he is quite a stranger to lady woodville and all this family and would certainly consider it as the highest breach of hospitality if i were to leave him in the hands of a parcel of virtuous women which are a race of beings that he is totally unacquainted with he is young has a very large fortune and many amiable qualities but his education has been so shamefully neglected that he is in imminent danger of becoming a prey to sharpers and prostitutes  even you must have smiled to have seen this young man who is made up of frolic and vivacity look as frighted and abashed before lady woodville whose gentleness itself as a young country lady who has never been out of the family mansion when first presented at st jamess but i hope this timid aukwardness will wear off in a few days and as i know nothing that can refine the sentiments or polish the manners so much as the coversation of elegant women i wish to keep sir james for some time amongst us  my cousin lady hariet hanbury is here and a very lively girl miss weston a near relation of my emily your old friend ransford spends much of his time with us also what would i not give to tempt you hither you shall retire when you please read walk and muse alone and when you are disposed my emily shall play to you some of the sweetest softest airs the very food of love accompanied with the sweetest softest voice you ever heard harriet who is of the melancholy cast and i fear unhappily in love shall sigh in concert with you and thornton and miss weston shall sometimes make you smile  i confess to you my dear seymour that i was both shocked and sorry when i heard that the marchioness was in england lady woodville was the first person who informed me of it but utterly ignorant of there having ever been any connection between us she did not perceive my emotion at her name  cruel woman does she wish again to disturb the peace of a heart which she had well nigh broken but i defy her power  in lady woodville i have found all that is amiable in the most lovely sex sensible beautiful gentle kind and unaffectedly good  true she is not mistress of those lively sallies of wit that dazzle the understanding and captivate the heart her form though lovely has not the striking elegance the nameless numberless graces that wait on every motion of the marchioness  but why do i suffer myself to dwell upon her charms or make a comparison injurious to the amiable woman who deserves my love why can i not say who possesses it ah seymour it is impossible to regulate the motions of the human heart by the cold rules of reason not all the charms of the whole sex combined can ever render mine susceptible of those agonizing transports it has already known yet let me boast that it is as impossible for her who first occasioned to revive as for any other woman to inspire them  if this was not the case i should have made a worthless present to my emily when i gave her both my hand and heart and though i allow the latter not to be an adequate return for hers she shall never be able to discover its deficiency by any word or action of my life this i can safely promise  i have purposely avoided mentioning your lost your lovely charlotte when you are more at ease i know you will acquaint me with the particulars of your distress why may not that happy era be hastened by a reliance on all the tender cares of friendship which you may certainly depend on from  your ever affectionate woodville ps you have a house within a mile of york where we have spent many happy days  days of ease and nights of pleasure who knows but we may there recover our juvenile tastes and passions impossible as well when advanced in life might we hope to recover our youth in those fields where we once were young  but is that house untenanted will you be our host or have you let or lent it    letter ix lord seymour to lord woodville my dear woodville your letter has added to the affliction i am already involved in i think i am fated never to possess any of those blessings without which life is a burden the object of my fondest tenderest wishes already torn from my bleeding heart there remained yet one consolation a generous and affectionate friend and he in human suicide is going to rob me of himself what an hard lot is mine all that i ever loved devote themselves and by their misery i am twice undone  but stop my friend and let my warning voice prevent your rushing down the precipice you must not shall nor see the marchioness i will go to woodfort though heaven knows how unfit to mingle in society merely to prevent your going to york races  the siren will be there   i went last night to pay a visit to my sister lady sandford and there i met your lovely enemy she asked many questions about you but many more about lady woodville and wanted me to draw her picture i told her that i had not seen her for some years that she was then extremely young but had i thought a very near resemblence to her ladyship which was pronouncing her a perfect beauty  i said this to prevent her finding fault which she certainly would have done had i attempted a particular description she saw through my design but would not let me triumph in the success of it then smiling said like me perhaps that was the reason he chose her  constant creature this is a compliment for which i think myself more indebted to him than for all the fine things he ever said or wrote to me  i hope madam his lordship had other motives o fie lord seymour how you love to mortify but pray let me indulge my vanity a little as the man is married and to a perfect beauty too there can be no danger in avowing my sensibility of his regards this you know i never did while he was single and i might have hopes but woman have strange caprices  however i can assure you i have not the least design upon his heart it would be the height of vanity indeed to attempt rivalling this perfect beauty it would be the height of cruelty madam but to wish it i declare i cannot see it in that light my lord for such a woman can never want adorers our married ladies madam seek for that character only in their husbands nay now my lord you want to impose on me as i am a stranger but you cannot deceive me for i know numberless instances to contradict your assertion and not one to prove it and i really think that london is as much the seat of gallantry as paris   the arrival of other company gave the conversation a general turn but what i have repeated is i think sufficient to make you fly from a woman who audaciously owns her designs against your peace as she talked of going to york my sister who is to accompany her requested i would let her have my house which i readily assented to but were it unemployed i would refuse it to my dear woodville  you see the snare is laid and will you selfdevoted rush into it i know you woodville you cannot live with loss of honor and it is impossible to preserve yours if in your present situation you can be again drawn in to dote upon this  but i will not abuse her i shall set out for woodfort to morrow and there enforce every argument i have used to preserve you from yourself  till then adieu seymour  letter x lady woodville to lady straffon i cannot tell my dearest fanny how much her last letter affected me nor can i sufficiently express my admiration of that happy turn of mind that enables you to triumph over every difficulty and distress and to rise so far superior to what any one might reasonably expect from the gentleness of your nature on every trial  how happy is it for your poor weak emely that she has had nothing to struggle with she would have sunk beneath the slightest weight and give a loose to tears and to complainings but let the goodness of that allwise providence who proportions our trials to our strength fill my heart with the warmest gratitude and let me ever bless and praise his name  i have no sort of doubt but you are eased of all a mothers fears by this time and that the dear little ones are prattling round you with their usual cheerfulness while you feel even an additional tenderness from recollection of the danger they have past  i have very uneasy apprehensions for poor lucy i almost wish she may not receive the infection  there have been numberless instances of persons who never had the small pox and i think it is like forcing nature to make a second effort  i detest sir james miller and hope with all my heart he may never be married to lucy as i am very sure he never will deserve her  our family party has received some very agreeable additions since i wrote last there is a most delightful contrast between our visitors sir james thornton lively boyish with a good natural understanding totally unimproved without the least idea of good breeding  and yet that want is amply supplied by what i call natural politeness but if good breeding is the blossom of good sense we ought to find out some other term for that species of form which is only to he acquired in courts there was such an awkward reserve about poor thornton for the first three days he spent at woodfort that i looked upon him as a hottentot but that rough cast is now worn off and he is really agreeable and entertaining  lord seymour our latest guest is really an accomplished gentleman an elegant form and affable countenance bespeak your favor at first sight and his every word and action insensibly engage your regard yet lavish as nature has been to him there seems to be something wanting to his happiness there is a tender air of melancholy diffused over his whole form with such a softness in his voice and manner as is rarely natural to the gay sons of prosperity his fortune is ample and his birth high it must then be that source of the most poignant sorrow illfated love that has disturbed his peace yet i think he could not love in vain unless there was a prior prepossession i long to know his story i feel myself interested as for a brother  he acquainted my lord with his intentions to visit us the night before he came we were all engaged to dine at sir harry ransfords the next day and her ladyship had got the old knight to consent to her having a ball my lord remained at woodfort to receive his guest i accompanied the young folks to sir harrys  after tea i entreated lady ransford to excuse my leaving her without taking any notice of it to the company she was so obliging as to consent and i drove home directly  my lord seemed surprised and pleased at seeing me and as he handed me from the coach said with an air of the utmost tenderness i am much obliged to you for your attention to my friend and can with truth assure you that your company is the only agreeable addition that could be made to our present society my little heart exulted at the kindness of this compliment as to please or oblige him is and ever will be its highest ambition notwithstanding this i thought my company was a restraint on them and therefore retired soon after supper  it was four oclock when my lord came up stairs i was miserably apprehensive he was ill as he sighed often and was uncommonly restless but my fears are now fled like a morning dream  he seemed perfectly well at breakfast lord seymour and he are gone into the gardens  the coach is just returned with the boys and girls and thornton is this moment come into my dressing room to tell me all about it as he expresses himself but he is too civil to speak till i leave of writing i must therefore impose silence on myself to relieve him from it and so bid my dear sister  adieu e w  letter xi lady straffon to lady woodville i was vastly pleased with my dear emilys letter  there is infinitely more merit in looking up to the almighty in our prosperity than adversity praise is surely the noblest and of course the most acceptable sacrifice that a human creature can offer to the great author of good mr addison very justly observes that a mind which has the least turn to religion naturally flies to it in affliction we then feel our own insufficiency we are humbled by sorrow and perhaps only then deduce real satisfaction from a thorough conviction that there is a superior being whose aid is graciously promised to those who sincerely seek it but surrounded by the delights of life youth fortune gaiety and dissipation we too frequently become forgetful of the source from whence our blessings flow and while we are indulging all our appetites in the delicious stream of happiness it becomes impregnated with the qualities of lethe and renders us unmindful of its fountain  but let me be truly thankful that the sister of my love the child of my care is not only blessed with the insignia of happiness but with a heart capable of the first virtue gratitude which i hope will ensure to her the long and full possession of all earthly good  i now can tell my dear prophetess her hopes are accomplished  the mothers fears are lost in the happy certainty of my childrens perfect recovery  but the friend still suffers  poor lucy continues extremely ill though thank god this day pronounced out of danger the smallpox was as favorable to her as possible but the emotions of her mind on account of that wretch sir james miller has thrown her into a violent fever  he is this day to be married to miss nelson this she is yet ignorant of but on the first day that she sat up she received a kind of leavetaking letter from him excusing his perfidy by her want of complaisance to his request said he had reason to apprehend that a lady who seemed so little inclined to oblige him before marriage would not make a very complying wife  that he was glad to hear her beauty out of danger as there was no doubt but it would procure her a better husband than him and that he should endeavor to look out for a wife who was less anxious about her features was there ever any thing so provoking this is adding insolence to baseness  if sir john was here i am sure a duel would ensue  i know not how to act in this affair  i cannot bear the thoughts of his triumphing in his villainy nor yet can i think of hazarding sir johns life to punish such a scoundrel swift says the occasions are few that can induce a man of sense and virtue to draw his sword i am certain were he living he would allow  to be a justifiable one  but as a wife and mother i most sincerely hope sir john may never hear of his infamous behavior but what excuse to invent for breaking off the match i know not sir john is jealous of his honor and will inquire minutely into the affair i will refer it all to lucys prudence she loves her brother and is a christian  you are an admirable painter i should have known lord seymours picture if you had not set the name to it all but that shade of melancholy which you had thrown over it he was extremely lively when i knew him but i have not seen him since his return to england  you have made me perfectly acquainted with sir james thornton i saw his precipitate stride into your dressing room and his short stop on finding you were writing it reminded me of the snapping of a watchspring have you ever had one break in your hand lucy has just awoke from a refreshing sleep and on being told i was writing she desires to see me immediately  i will return to you again  what an affecting interview that odious idiot sir james miller has like the base indian thrown a pearl away richer than all his tribe when i went into lucys chamber she desired every one to withdraw then taking my hand and pressing it to her lips what infinite trouble must i have given to the compassionate heart of my dear lady straffon but i hope you do not despise me it was the weak state of my body that overpowered my mind but now that i have recovered my senses i am amazed how i could be affected by the loss of such a man  did i say loss then i fear i rave again but i grieved for an ideal character and am much obliged to sir james for removing the mist from before my eyes and showing himself in his native colors how happy the delusion vanished so soon had it continued but a little longer i should have been a wretch indeed what a misery to despise the man whom it is our duty to love and honor yet such might have been my fate should i have been unpardonably criminal my dearest sister  i entreated her not to think upon the subject but to calm her spirits and that i would converse with her on any other topic that she pleased  she begged my attention for a few minutes said she had wandered from her purpose and asked my pardon for detaining me you are writing lady straffon perhaps to my brother then raising herself on her knees in spite of my efforts to hinder her let me in this humble posture entreat you my dearest sister not to mention what has passed to sir john i know his natural bravery joined to his love for an only sister would tempt him to call sir james miller to an account  good god what might be the consequence he has done me no wrong and should any misfortune happen to my brother from this event i could not answer for my senses and were even the aggressor for such indeed he is to fall i never should know peace again  here she was quite overcome by weakness and sunk down in a stood of tears i said every thing in my power to assuage her grief and gave her the strongest assurances that i neither did or would mention a syllable of the affair to sir john she told me then i had restored her tranquillity and she should soon be well and able to contrive some plausible pretense to her brother for breaking off the match and as this would be the first falsehood she had ever told him she hoped it might be considered as a pious fraud only  after this conversation she grew perfectly composed i left her retired to rest but i fear she has disturbed mine for this night what an amiable heart is hers while yet smarting with undeserved wounds she would preserve the cruel wretch who inflicted them i will religiously keep my promise to her yet cannot help sincerely wishing that his crime may be his punishment and i think he bids fair for being overpaid in kind  miss nelson now lady miller is at least twentynine and has been a remarkable coquette these ten years yet never could catch a poor unguarded fly in her net till sir james rushed in  she was perfectly acquainted with his attachment to lucy had requested to be her bridemaid yet could think of separating them for ever may they be mutual avengers of each others perfidy  i feel myself in an unchristian mood i cannot help it i pity folly but detest vice alas my emily i am too severe for they are in general synonimous terms i will in charity wish you good night for if i write on i shall rail more therefore adieu  f s  letter xii lady woodville to lady straffon my dear fanny i am so violently provoked at the insolent baseness of that abominable miller that i cannot find words to express my resentment i do not think you seem sufficiently rejoiced at lucys escape from such a monster for my part i am delighted at the thoughts of his being married to such a woman as miss nelson  may she render him just as miserable as he deserves to be  his greatest enemy could not wish him worse  but there are more wretches in the world than he and lucy is not without companions in affliction the willow grows on purpose for our sex and were it to be watered only by the tears drawn from beauteous eyes by the perfidy of men it would need no other moisture poor lady harriet an accident has discovered the cause of her too frequent sighs  yesterday morning after breakfast when the gentlemen had retired to their separate amusements lady harriet miss weston and i were in my dressing room lady harriet took up priors poems and was reading henry and emma to fanny and me who were at work when in rushed lady ransford in a riding dress and begged i would permit her to introduce a gentleman an acquaintance of here is whom she accidentally met on the road as she was coming to spend the day with me she concluded he was a particular friend whom she had not seen for a long time i immediately consented and said i was sorry my lord was not at home to receive the gentleman  she ran out directly and led in captain barnard  while she was presenting him to me the book fell from lady harriets hand and she sunk motionless upon the couch as soon as the captain cast his eyes on her he appeared almost in the same condition the color forsook his lips and he could hardly breathe lady ransford looked with a spiteful kind of astonishment and cried out what can all this mean is she subject to fits fanny and i were engaged in trying to recover lady harriet i began to fear in vain  life seemed for some minutes absolutely fled  the wretched captain looked the picture of despair  the moment she opened her eyes he bowed left the room mounted his horse and rode off  we conveyed lady harriet to her chamber and laid her on the bed when a plentiful shower of tears seemed to have relieved her i left fanny weston with her and returned to lady ransford she seemed in a violent passion that the captain was gone  what has he to do with lady harriets faintings she was very sure it was only an air she gave herself she thanked god she was not subject to such tricks she never fainted in her life and was quite certain she never should etc etc  i congratulated her on the goodness of her constitution said lady harriets was extremely delicate and that she had not been well for some time this did not satisfy her and she continued out of humor at the captains desertion the whole day several times repeating i do not suppose he ever saw her before of what consequence was her fainting to him and i encouraged her in this opinion though far from believing it  i said his retiring was a mark of politeness as the presence of a stranger must increase the confusion we were in nothing that i said could pacify her i therefore suffered her to mutter out her dissatisfaction without replying for the remainder of the time she staid which was not long after dinner  she said she should be afraid to ride with only one servant after it was dusk  i never was better pleased with the departure of a guest i longed to see poor harriet who had not left her rooom and flew to her the moment lady ransford was gone she looked abashed and held down her lovely eyes which were yet bathed in tears when i approached her  but the tenderness with which i inquired concerning her health seemed to reassure her  you are too good to me my dear lady woodville such weakness as mine scarcely deserves your compassion and i can only presume to hope for it by the most unbounded confidence which i should long since have reposed in your friendly bosom but that i thought it cruel even for a moment to interrupt that happiness which you so well deserve but as the accident which happened this day must convince you that there is a secret sorrow which preys upon my heart i will readily acquaint you with the cause of it lest the tenderness of your nature should make you imagine me more wretched than i really am  you must suppose my dear said i that your situation this morning alarmed me extremely but i have long thought there was some secret source for that soft melancholy which you vainly endeavor to represent as constitutional but do not let this remark make you think yourself under a necessity of disclosing your secrets to me i am far from desiring to pry into them but should rejoice at having it in my power to do any thing which might alleviate your distress and if my participation of your sorrow can footh it but for a moment it will more than repay me for what i feel in knowing that you are unhappy  she said she was not then capable of making the least return to my kindness though perfectly sensible of it but that as soon as she was able she would write out her short story for me and lady straffon she said lucy knew something of it but not the whole and desired she might see it as a kind of consolation under her present circumstances  as soon as i receive i will send it to you pray present my love to lucy and tell her i entreat her company at woodsort whenever she is able to travel change of air and objects will forward her recovery why cannot you and the little ones accompany her and complete the wishes of  your affectionate e woodville  letter xiii lady woodville to lady straffon my dear sister i this morning received the enclosed which has engaged my attention ever since i have but just time to send it to you without the smallest comment but as it may remain longer in your hands i shall expect it to be returned with notes variorum  i have absented myself from our family party which is indeed a charming one except during dinner this whole day i shall return to it with a double gust from a certainty that amiable as they who compose it are in their manners and persons their hearts are still more valuable haste then my dearest fanny and lucy to partake and perfect the most delightful society in the world  sincerely prays your e woodville the memoir of lady harriet hanbury as the strongest mark of my sincerity and gratitude to my dear lady woodville for all her kindness to me i sit down to fulfill the voluntary promise i made of acquainting her with the few events of a short life whose duration has only been marked by sorrow and as to mention is to suffer pain i chose to save her gentle heart the uneasiness of seeing the distress which the recollection of unhappy circumstances must ever revive where the sufferer is the relater i must now like all biographers step a little back to give you some account of the authors of my being and then proceed with a plain narrative submitting my weaknesses and follies without the least reserve to your friendly eye  my father was eldest son to the earl of g  during my grandfathers life he became passionately in love with my mother who was a daughter of colonel stanleys and reputed one of the greatest beauties of that time my father well knew it would be in vain to hope for the earls consent to his marrying without a large fortune let the merits of the lady be ever so great as his estate was extremely involved and that he had four children by a second wife unprovided for  my mothers portion was only four thousand pounds but her father who considered her birth beauty and accomplishments as full equivalents to any fortune when he found the earl was not acquainted with my fathers courtship forbade his daughter ever to see her lover more as his pride would not suffer him to have matched her with a prince clandestinely  the lovers reduced to this unhappy situation after much fruitless sorrow had recourse to the usual alternative and married without consent on either side the affair was not long kept secret and the earl whose rage was without bounds accused the colonel of being privy to the marriage and of drawing in his son  he also lavished every kind of abuse upon my mother and stopped the allowance he had for some years given to my father  the colonel though highly offended with his daughter resented the cruelty and injustice of the earls behavior and sent him a challenge  the duel was prevented by my fathers address but the most implacable hatred ever remained between the old gentlemen which communicated itself to every branch of the families except my father and mother who were the most perfect patterns of conjugal tenderness  notwithstanding my fathers increasing fondness for his lovely wife the unhappy feuds which she thought herself the occasion of preyed on her tender mind and so much weakened her delicate frame that giving me life she lost her own  fatal exchange for her unhappy orphan my father was quite distracted at her loss and the colonel who had been reconciled to them both for some time was obliged to restrain his own affliction to endeavor to console my father and engage him to preserve his life by frequently presenting me before him  yes he would then say i will live for the protection of that only transcript of my angel harriet i will watch over her rising virtues and endeavor to restore to the world some part of that perfection my cruel father has deprived it of for four years his fondness for me was unabated and i appeared to be the sole object of his attention and regard  about that era the earl wrote to him and a reconciliation soon ensued the terms of which were that as my father had gratified himself by his first marriage he should oblige the earl and serve his family by a second my father whose nature was gentle was soon induced to comply and as i believe his real fondness for my mother had rendered all women indifferent to him the choice of his future lady was entirely left to the earl who you may suppose would rate her value only by her fortune my father paid his addresses in form and even without the least degree of liking on either side the match was concluded  the perpetual scenes of discord which succeeded to this illsuited marriage are but too public and i have great reason to apprehend that to this constant source of domestic misery i owe the loss of my unhappy father the first cause of disgust my stepmother gave him was her absolutely refusing to let me be brought into the house politely adding that she would not suffer a beggars brat to be brought up with her children who were at least entitled to a fortune by their mothers side and that those who had nothing but their blood to boast of should be bred humble to lower their pride this one specimen is i think sufficient to give you a perfect idea of my poor fathers unhappiness and i shall say nothing more of one who has the honor to bear his name and title  i remained at my grandfathers and was his principal favorite my father continued to see me frequently and notwithstanding his family was increased by the birth of a son and two daughters his fondness for me appeared undiminished  but neither his lady nor the earl ever took the least notice of me  my fathers sister lady woodville was extremely kind to me and even pressed my grandfather to let me live with her but he refused to part with the only joy he had on earth and she died before him  when i was about fourteen i was deprived of my affectionate and tender parent the good old colonel  before he died he recommended me in the most affecting terms to my father who promised every thing in my favor that he could desire but seemed offended that the colonel should think it necessary to plead for his dearest best beloved child the child of his affection the child of his ever adored and lamented harriet fully satisfied with these assurances the good old man resigned his soul in peace leaving me all his personal fortune which amounted to about six thousand pound his paternal estate being entailed on a male heir  lady anne westrop who was a distant relation of my mothers invited me to live with her and in the society of this agreeable woman i began to recover my natural cheerfulness which had been totally obsorbed by the grief i felt for my grandfathers ill health and death  during a year that we passed entirely at her seat in the country i knew not one moments uneasiness  my mind was like a peaceful ocean whose every motion was uniformly gentle without one ruffling breeze to disturb or deform it yet sufficiently actuated to prevent languor or disgust the stagnation of the soul  how often have i looked back with regret upon this pleasing calm which was alas too soon succeeded by impetuous storms where all my peace was shipwrecked about the end of this happy era captain barnard came to pay a visit to his sister lady anne he is youngest son to the earl of w  he was designed for the navy and his father was at that time soliciting a ship which he soon obtained for him i shall not take up your ladyships time by giving you an account of our childish courtship but tell you at once that a mutual flame was quickly caught was quickly too revealed for neither bosom lodged a wish which virtue keeps concealed what happy hours of heartfelt bliss did love on both bestow but bliss too mighty long to last where fortune proves a foe   in the midst of these truly arcadian pleasures the earl my grandfather died which i can by no means say disturbed my happiness but alas it was to be interrupted by a severer shock for my father survived him but eleven days the six thousand pounds which colonel stanley had bequeathed to me were in my fathers hands his estate was all settled upon the issue of his second marriage and his debts amounted to rather more than his personal fortune so that there remained not a shilling for me even of my grandfathers legacy without going to law with the countess my stepmother who had possessed herself of every thing my father left  i grieved only for his loss that of my fortune appearing then of no consequence my lover seemed to redouble his tenderness for me but thought circumstanced as i then was it would be prudent to conceal our passion as it was highly probable his friends might oppose our union i acquiesced in his opinion and rested all my hopes of happiness on him  unworthy guardian of that sacred trust  when the time for his leaving the westhill arrived i then discovered that i had never known sorrow before it was impossible to conceal my anguish and lady ann westrop who had taken great pains to comfort me for the death of my father and imagined not without reason that my grief had subsided into a calm and gentle melancholy seemed astonished at the violence of my affliction but i might have answered her with the words of helena i think not on my father and these great tears do grace his memory more than those i shed for him  however i thought it very lucky that my late misfortune appeared a sufficient cause for my present melancholy which i indulged to such an excess as soon affected my constitution and i was ordered by my physician to bristol lady anne ever kind and affectionate toward me accompanied me thither and mr westrop went to london to consult lawyers about the recovery of my fortune  the frequency and tenderness of captain barnards letter contributed much more to the restoration of my health than all the waters of those salubrious springs and lady anne expressed such sincere joy at my recovery that i romantic as i was thought myself bound in honor to acquaint her with the real cause of it i thought concealing any thing from such a friend was acting a lie and in the fullness of my gratitude i poured forth all the secrets of my heart  she heard me with that sort of coldness with which one listens to a twice told tale yet at the same time assured me she had never suspected any attachment between her brother and me said she wished for both our sakes we could conquer our passion for she was certain it could only be productive of misery to both  i was equally piqued at her manner and expression and replied with some warmth that as i considered myself under very great obligations to her i would not entail misery on any part of her family let my own fate be what it would she applauded my resolution with the same sang froid with which she had heard my story and i retired from her apartment to my own more humbled and mortified than i had ever been in my life  i passed a most restless miserable night sometimes resolving on the highest generosity to break with captain barnard  the next moment repeating vows of everlasting love  but at all events i determined to quit lady anne yet whither should i go where fly to a wretched orphan without friends or fortune  the agitation of my mind at length subsided and toward morning i fell into a profound slumber as i slept much longer than usual i found lady annes woman by my bed side when i awoke who said she came from her lady to inquire my health and to request that i would go to her immediately  i obeyed the summons instantly and while i was hurrying on my clothes flattered myself that she had relented of her unkindness and wished again to restore me to that sisterly affection which she seemed so long to have felt for me and yet to have lost in one moment possessed with this imagination i ran or rather flew to her apartment but on opening the door was surprised to see lord n  who appeared very earnest in conversation with her ladyship  this gentleman had been very particular to me ever since our residence at bristol he was young polite and master of a large independent fortune but these advantages had made me rather decline than encourage his acquaintance lest the busy tongues of men or rather women might have pronounced him a lover  an epithet which is of all others most hateful to a delicate preengaged heart  on my entrance the conversation became general lady anne affected to treat me with her usual tenderness but i too plainly saw that she only affected it after some little time she withdrew abruptly and left me alone with lord n  a thousand disagreeable things rushed into my mind at once but above all i feared a declaration of love from his lordship which though i was determined to refuse must have distressed me extremely as i could not to the world assign any justifiable cause for my refusal  i rose from my seat with trepidation and rang the bell for breakfast i hoped this would be a hint for his lordship to retire  on the contrary he said it was very fortunate for him that i called for tea as he had not touched any thing but a glass of water that day and should have absolutely forgot that eating was necessary if i had not reminded him of it but since i had he hoped i would allow him the honor of breakfasting with me  i coolly bowed assent and the moment the tea table was removed said i must retire to put on my riding dress as i had promised to meet a lady on the downs and feared i should keep her waiting lord n  saw my confusion pitied and believed it by saying he would not trespass farther on my leisure but hoped i would permit him the honor of paying me a visit in the afternoon he did not wait for my reply and i thought myself infinitely obliged to him for even postponing the embarassment in which i knew i should be too soon involved  as soon as lady anne and i were alone after dinner she congratulated me with a serious air on the important conquest i had made enumerated the great advantages of such a match and said she was rejoiced to find by the ease and propriety of my behavior that the silly prepossession i had talked of the night before had not rendered me so romantically absurd as to reject happiness and lord n  or to persist in embracing misery and captain barnard  though i had in some measure prepared myself to hear her speak on this subject yet i could not avoid feeling the utmost surprise at her want of delicacy in mentioning the man whom i professed to love at the same instant that she approved my accepting of another  as soon as i recovered myself i told her that i was neither entitled to her congratulation or approbation as lord n  had never said any thing upon such a subject to me and that i hoped he never would as i should be very sorry to give him the mortification of a denial but at the same time that i fled from what she called happiness i hoped i should find what i thought so in the consciousness of having acted right for though i never could divest myself of the tenderest attachment to captain barnard yet i could sacrifice my hopes of any future connection with him to his advantage and her desire  lady anne took me at my word praised my generosity and entreated i would take time to consider before i refused lord n  i assured her that delay was unnecessary and as i had a very high esteem for his lordship and was sincerely grateful for the honor he intended me i could not think of trifling with his peace or meanly accepting a heart because set in gold when it was absolutely impossible for me to make the only return which such a valuable present deserved she called me dear romantic generous girl said she had no doubt but time and reason would conquer my childish passion and that she should rejoice to see me happy with some worthy man but still entreated me not to act precipitately with regard to lord n  as she feared i might never have such another offer  this kind of conversation lasted till lord n  came to visit us and i now wished for his making that delaration i so much dreaded in the morning i was determined on the conduct i should pursue toward him and secretly triumphed in the sacrifice i should make to my truly disinterested love for captain barnard however her ladyship took care that we should not so immediately come to an explanation for she never left us the whole evening lord n  appeared to be chagrined and i was also extremely mortified that the affair was not brought to a conclusion  the next day i received a letter from mr westrop informing me that my stepmother had consented to give me four thousand pounds rather than stand a law suit for the six which my grandfather left me in consideration of this sum i was to relinquish all farther claim to my fathers fortune and to receive it as a present from her bounty these terms i thought extremely hard but to attempt carrying on an expensive suit without money appeared impracticable it is true mr westrop in the most friendly manner offered to advance any sum i might have occasion for but i already felt the weight of my obligation to lady anne and determined not to increase the load i therefore complied with these severe conditions but as i was not of age mr westrop became security for my part of the contract and the interest of this splendid sum was allotted for my maintenance  on this occasion lady anne behaved with the utmost kindness toward me begged i would consider her as my sister and never think of quitting her house till i went to one of my own she made me several valuable presents which i received with the utmost reluctance yet could not refuse as her manner of bestowing them was peculiarly polite and tender in short she did every thing in her power to conciliate that true esteem and affection which her conduct with regard to captain barnard had for a while restrained  lord n  soon found an opportunity to disclose his passion for me and i as quickly put an end to all his hopes he thanked me for the generous frankness of my conduct and earnestly entreated to see me as a friend though i had denied him as a lover i readily consented to his request and have ever found him a most amiable and worthy man  i had not received a letter from captain barnard for near a month  he was stationed in the mediterranean and though determined sa soon as he returned to england to take an everlasting leave of him i grew impatient at his silence and longed to return to westhill to retrace those paths we had trod together and woo sweet echo to repeat his name i knew lady anne received foreign letters frequently some of which i supposed were from captain barnard but as she was silent on the subject of them i did not think it proper to appear inquisitive and some weeks elapsed without suffering that name to pass my lips which was but too deeply engraved on my heart  at length the time for our departure came and we arrived at westhill  the morning after i rose very early in order to indulge the fond idea of revisiting those woods and lawns where i had spent so many happy hours i did not imagine any of the family were stirring and went softly into lady annes dressing room where all the english poets lay to take a book with me into the garden i started at finding her there her surprise at seeing me equalled mine but quickly recovering herself she talked of the fineness of the morning which she said had tempted her to leave her bed so soon but that finding the dew was not off the grass she had sat down to write letters  a propos said she i have had one in my possession for you these ten days but as i did not know whether the contents might be perfectly agreeable to you i chose to defer delivering it till we were quite free from observers i flatter myself madam said i that your precaution was unnecessary if as i apprehend the letter comes from captain barnard lady anne replied do not be too sanguine my dear we feel our disappointments in proportion to our expectations true madam i returned but as the height of mine at present extends only to knowing that your brother is well and happy do not protract on that account but be so good to let me have my letter  she then presented it to me saying i believe you had better retire to your own apartment before you read it i willingly obeyed but though all this preparation was sufficient to alarm me yet at the sight of those dear well known characters i forgot all that lady anne had said and broke the seal with the highest transport but before i had read half the following lines i in reality suffered the transformation which ovid seigned for niobe my limbs were petrified nor was the least sign of life or motion remaining in me but my flowing tears  to lady harriet hanbury madam the ingratitude and unkindness of your behavior toward me deserves such reproahes as i am incapable of making to a person i once truly loved i ought to be thankful for your having cured me of that folly but the manner of your doing it takes away the merit of the obligation  unworthy harriet you might have ceased to love without betraying and exposing the wretch who doated on you lord n  s superior rank and fortune were temptations i scarce could hope you should withstand but why ingrate should you despise and ridicule the fondness of that heart where though you have planted daggers there still remains the warmest wishes for your future happiness  it is now above two months since i have heard from you this cruel this alarming silence filled my fond bosom with the tenderest sorrow i had a thousand fears for my loved harriet i feared some fatal accident might have befallen her i feared every thing that could befall except her breach of vows the fidelity of my own heart prevented that suspicion  but i have done for ever on this subject nor will i longer interrupt your felicity than to entreat as my last request if you have thought my letters worth preserving that you will immediately deliver them to my sister if ever i return to england and you desire it i will restore yours dear as they once were to my faithful heart which wants not mementos of the faithless harriet  i have got another ship and shall use all my interest to prevent my return to england amidst all the perils to which my situation daily exposes me i wished to preserve my life for your sake only but your perfidy has now rendered it of as little value to me as it ever was to you and to die nobly in the service of my country is at present the most earnest wish of  the unfortunate wm barnard   i had remained for some hours in the situation i have already described when lady anne sent her woman to call me to breakfast on finding my eyes fixed and my whole frame immovable mrs atkins screamed so loud that lady anne and mr westrop ran into my dressing room i was immediately put into bed and every care was taken for my recovery a slow fever ensued which i daily hoped would terminate my life and misery but it pleased providence that i should be reserved for greater woes  as soon as i was capable of reasoning i found captain barnard had been imposed upon and felt even more for his sufferings than my own  but who could have deceived him it must be lady anne but as i was not in a situation to resent such cruelty i thought it most prudent to acquiesce in silence and wait till time the great expounder of mysteries should clear my innocence she frequently observed that as i was determined to break with him it would be better to let him remain in his error than to come to an explanation that could answer no end as we were to part for ever to this i could by no means agree but alas it was not in my power to oppose her pleasure i neither knew the name of his ship nor the place of his destination and i continued for near twelve months a prey to the most cruel suspense  at this time lady anne and mr westrop purposed making the petit tour and insisted on my accompanying them  i gladly accepted the offer for i might truly say i had such perpetual source of disquiet in my own breast that rest was grown painful to me and a state of agitation only could afford me case by rescuing me as it were from myself  though we spent a month in london to wait for the conclusion of the peace i knew not where to make any enquiry after captain barnard nor had i a friend to whom i could venture to repeat his name and i set out for paris much more inclined to enter into the most gloomy solitude than to partake of the pleasures of that gay city  there i became acquainted with lord woodville and there i also met mrs bolton who was nearly related to me by my mother  we had been acquainted from our infancy and had a real friendship for each other but her living in ireland where her husband had a very large fortune had prevented our meeting for three years before she was in a very declining state of health and was going to montpelier on that account when mr bolton was obliged to set out for ireland on the death of a near relation  as lady anne was constantly engaged in the grande monde i spent much of my time with mrs bolton and with real sorrow saw that amiable woman growing worse every day  her physicians at length had her removed to fontainbleau  just then lady anne grew weary of paris and resolved to pursue her route poor mrs bolton shed a flood of tears when i talked of quitting paris and entreated me not to leave her a helpless stranger in a foreign land even her own maid had married one of the gens darmes and lest her so that he had not a creature about her that had the least regard or tenderness for her she said a few days would put an end to the arduous task she required from my friendship that of closing her dying eyes but that if mr bolton should return before that happened her carriage and servants should convey me to lady anne or wherever i desired  there was no resisting her importunities and lady anne though dissatisfied at my stay applauded the nobleness of my friendship and took a very affectionate leave of me i saw her get into a carriage with sincere regret i considered myself as torn from one who had been the friend and protectress of my youth her cruelty was forgot and every act of kindness she had ever shown me returned with double force into my memory and my heart and eyes overflowed with grateful tenderness  i was waiting in this situation of mind for mrs boltons chariot to carry me to fontainbleau when captain barnard entered the room i will not pretend to describe the emotions of my heart in short they were too strong for my reason and suspended all its powers  never sure was such a meeting the extremes of love surprise resentment joy all operated on me  he was all penitence and love kneeled at my feet and bathed my hand with tears pleaded the violence of his distracted love in excuse for the cruel letter he had wrote when he believed me false and uttered the most solemn vows that it i would again receive his heart which never had strayed one moment from me no power on earth should ever part us more but if i refused to accept his love he would instantly give up the command of his ship and retire to some part of the world where he should never be heard of  i will frankly confess that all my tenderness for this unworthy man returned and i even thought i loved him better than i had ever done before he was then of age and master of himself there remained therefore nothing to oppose our wishes for i own them mutual but the obligations i was under and the voluntary promise i had made to lady anne this objection he treated as romantic but said he would gratify my delicacy in this particular and engaged to obtain her free consent  he attended me to fontainbleau and visited me there every day during two months that my amiable friend continued to languish  at the end of that time she was released and left me in sincere affliction mr bolton returned a few days before her death and some time after made me a present of part of her jewels to the amount of two thousand pounds  i would have declined so valuable a gift but it was my dear mrs boltons dying request that i should have them  at captain barnards earnest entreaty i returned to paris where he still continued to solicit our marriage and i to refuse till he had fulfilled his promise with regard to lady anne  at length he extorted one from me that even her opposing it should not prevent our union and in an oblique manner confessed that she had been the cause of that letter which had given me so much pain by her misrepresentation of my conduct at bristol he that can please is certain to persuade and i at last acquuesced in his request  he would not hear of my returning into england till we were married i had no parents consent to ask and he had wrote to the chaplain of his ship to come and marry us seemingly possessed with the tenderest passion that ever warmed a human heart he set out for aix la chapelle where we supposed lady anne to be but unluckily she had left it two days before captain barnard arrived and was then returning to england thither the captain followed i was extremely concerned at this disappointment but it was only on account of the additional trouble and fatigue he was to undergo  he wrote to me the very post nay i was sometimes so happy as to receive two or three letters wrote at different times of the same day filled with the language of love with fond complaints of absence and vows never to leave me more  however blinded as i was by my own passion i could not help perceiving that when he had been some time in england the style of his letters began to change though he still continued to complain of the cruel necessity that detained him but not in that charming plaintive style which used at once to soften and delight my heart  three months passed away in this manner during which time i received a cold but civil letter from lady anne congratulating me on the constancy of my lover and thanking me for the needless compliment i had paid her as she was perfectly convinced we were too much in love to follow any persons advice but our own  notwithstanding this she very sincerely wished my happiness whether i should or should not become her sister  as i found captain barnards return was still protracted by his fathers ill health and many other reasons that did not appear to me sufficient i began to be uneasy at my situation  a single wowan without friends or relations in such a place as paris was by no means in an eligible state  i had some acquaintance and those of distinction who received me on lady annes account without inquiring into the motives of my stay but i felt a consciousness that their civilities were more the effect of politeness than esteem which rendered me unhappy and i wrote to captain barnard requesting his permission to return to england if he did not intend to come to paris immediately  my letter lay sealed and directed on my dressingtable when lord n  came to make me a visit and casting his eyes on the letter said i might spare myself the trouble of sending it to the post office as he had that moment met captain barnard in a very fine equipage my heart sunk in me at this news  yet i still flattered myself that lord n  might mistake some other person for him and was earnest in persuading his lordship that he was deceived when the captains servant brought me the following card  if lady harriet h  will be at home and alone this evening captain barnard will if agreeable do himself the honor of waiting on her at six oclock  the surprise i had been in before was augmented by this extraordinary message i however sent word i should be glad to see him and passed the intermediate hours in endeavoring to prepare myself for that fatal change which was already but too visible but which i was utterly unable to account for  at the appointed time he came and endeavored to assume a sort of formal tenderness accompanied with an air of gravity and mystery i could not long endure such a cruel state of suspense and pressed to know what it was that affected him he told me he was the most miserable man breathing that all his schmes of happiness were blasted but that he never could have resolution to tell me how they were so  called me dear suffering angel kissed my hand and wept   i cannot describe the emotion of my heart i longed yet feared to know what all this meant and at length told him that if he did not wish to make me extremely unhappy he would explain this enigma he said he had great reason to fear that satisfying my inquiries would render me yet more wretched even than doubt could do and if the secret could be kept for ever from me he would die rather than reveal it but i must know it and he who was a sharer in the misfortune would tell it with most tenderness  he then conjured me to summon all the love i ever had for him that it might incline me to pity and pardon a wretch that had undone himself in short he told me that his friends had prevailed on him to marry miss s  whom he unfortunately met at aix la chapelle and accompanied to london  that at the moment he received her hand the icy one of death would have been more welcome that his heart did and ever should adore me and only me  he had knelt by my side while he told this fatal story and when he finished it wept extremely to his amazement not one sigh or tear escaped me i rose immediately and wished him joy then rung the bell to order my chariot he remained immovable i begged he would rise before the servant entered  he obeyed but implored me not to leave him said it was impossible that i could really be so indifferent as i appeared that he was prepared to meet my anger or my sorrow but could not bear contempt  i told him that was at present my predominant sentiment and the sooner he retired from it and put an end to this interview the better and which i would take care should be our last he vowed he would never leave the spot where he again prostrated himself till i pronounced his pardon i told him this was adding insult to injury but since he would not quit my apartment i should  i threw myself into my carriage and suffered myself to be carried to the marchioness de st aumonts  there i met lord woodville and lord n  who both remarked that i looked extremely ill and advised me to leave the assembly and return home and i soon found myself really so that i was obliged to follow their advice  i went immediately to bed without speaking a syllable even to my maid who observing so sudden a change in my manners and appearance sat up in my dressing room the heroism of my conduct toward captain barnard had flattered my pride and kept up my spirits while he was present but i was no sooner alone than i felt all the weight of my misfortunes and the agitation and distraction of my mind threw me into convulsions my maid had immediate help for me but all the art of the best physicians in paris could not restore my senses for fifteen days  happy interval delightful recess from agonizing sorrow  at length their cruel kindness triumphed so far as to restore my reason  but good god in what a shattered plight did it return and to what a poor defaced and wretched habitation my disorder was generally believed to be a malignant fever but doctor l  who understood the maladies of the mind as well as body and was acquainted with my attachment to captain barnard contributed to the recovery of the latter by administering consolation to the former much more than all the art of medicine could have done i soon discharged all my physicians but him who only knew the source of my complaint and to his skill and tenderness am i indebted for the preservation of this wretched being  during my illness lord woodville and lord n  behaved like brothers to me  they both visited me daily and endeavored but in vain and unknowing of the cause to dissipate that melancholy which will for ever prey upon my heart my mind was so much weakened that i determined to go into a convent and flattered myself that in that calm retirement i should find peace and rest i fancied i might there retain the tenets of my own religion only conforming externally to theirs  i communicated my project to doctor l  who soon convinced me that peace dwells not in a cloister but that even those holy retreats are filled with vain wishes and tumultuous passions and that it would be making a mockery of all religion to pretend to embrace theirs unless i could do it sincerely  while i remained in a very weak and languishing condition a gentleman called frequently to enquire my health but as he refused to leave his name i guessed it was some person sent by captain barnard and was therefore not the least inquisitive about him at length he desired to be admitted to see me saying he had something of importance to communicate  i consented and after the common civilities were over he took a packet out of his pocket and presenting it to me said he hoped that would be an acceptable present it was directed in an unknown hand but as i hesitated about receiving it he said i had nothing to fear from the contents and he would call for my answer the next day and instantly left the room  the packet contained a long letter from captain barnard filled with vain excuses for his falsehood and passionate entreaties that i would again suffer him to plead his pardon at my feet  he expressed the most poignant sorrow for my illness and begged i would at least permit him to repair the injuries he had done me as far as it was possible by accepting an unlimited power over that fortune to which he had sacrificed his love honor and happiness and as a proof of my forgiveness requested i would receive an enclosed bill for five hundred pounds but if my pride should still reject his penitence he desired i would return his letters by the gentleman that was the bearer of that  this fresh insult roused all my resentment against him and i passed a restless night counting the clock and with impatience waiting for the hour when i should restore his insolent present with the scorn it merited  at length his ambassador arrived and either was or seemed to be surprised when i acquainted him with the purport of the letter he had brought me and made many apologies for having unwittingly offended  said the affair between captain barnard and me had been represented in a very different light to him that he understood there had been a slight quarrel between us and that the letter he brought was to be the means of a reconcilement  cruel barnard merciless man was it not enough to make me wretched why should he endeavor to make me infamous also i returned the note and put the letter which had enclosed it into the fire as to those i had formerly received from captain barnard i told his friend i would readily part with them when he should have restored mine but as i had no reason to have the least reliance on his word i would not give them out of my possession on any other terms he applauded my resolution and retired  i longed impatiently to leave paris and fancied i should recover my peace by quitting the scene of my unhappiness  i was obliged to part with some of the jewels which mrs bolton had left me to defray the expenses of my illness and journey and in a state of the lowest weakness both of mind and body i returned to london  on my arrival i found that a maiden aunt of my fathers who had never taken the least notice of me during her life had bequeathed me her whole fortune ten thousand pounds merely because i was her namesake and unprovided for by my father this was a very happy addition to my confined circumstances but i was incapable of joy and continued to live like a recluse till lord woodvilles return to england  he soon found me out and did me the honor to present me to lady straffon and his lovely emily  in this charming society i began to recover my tranquillity and flattered myself that it was well nigh established till the unlucky accident which brought captain barnard to my sight convinced me that there is no cure for illfated love since neither the cruelty i have experienced nor time itself have yet been able to conquer it  i will not now my dear lady woodville take up more of your time by apologizing for the weakness of my conduct through this unhappy affair for  with thee i scorn the low constraint of art  and boast the graceful weakness of my heart       letter xiv lady straffon to lady woodville i have a thousand thanks to give my dear emily for the pleasing though melancholy entertainment which lady harriets history has afforded me  when i was very young i used to be surprised that so many tragedies and novels were founded on the perfidy of men but i have for some years past been perfectly convinced that most of the miseries in this life owe their being to that fatal source and were there but a window in every fair bosom in the cities of london and westminster we should discover numberless hidden traces of the barbarous triumphs of those doughty heroes famous and renowned for wronging innocence and breaking vows and among this detestable corpse i think captain barnard might lead the van and sir james miller bring up the rear  you may see by this disposition that i think worse of the captain than the baronet as i think lady harriet much more unhappy than lucy however i sincerely hope they may both surmount their afflictions for time and reason can do more in these cases than the sufferers are willing to allow they are patients that do not wish to be cured and find a degree of pleasure in indulging their malady  i am of opinion that when disappointed love subsides into a calm and gentle melancholy its sensations may not only be pleasing to the persons that feel it but render them more amiable than they would otherwise be by giving a peculiar softness both to their form and manners i think i should be more apt to fall in love with a person so circumstanced than with one who had never felt la belle passion  i have great pleasure in telling you that lucy daily gains strength both of mind and body and i by no means despair of a perfect cure the most favorable symptom is her not having mentioned sir james these two days yet have i not once restrained her on the subject as she has lately spoke of him with great calmness i have not yet shown her lady harriets memoir  tenderness like sorrow is contagious and the similitude of their situations might call forth tears which though set down to the account of friendship would certainly flow from her own sympathy  it is utterly impossible for me to have the pleasure of visiting woodfort this summer  i expect sir john in a very few days  as soon as he arrives we shall go into essex  i do not think lucy sufficiently recovered to quit her nurse as she calls me  my little emily and edward are quite well and surprizingly grown since their illness  i long to know what became of captain barnard the day he left you and what connection he coud have with lady ransford who from your account seems not to be one of those who were born to weep over the willow  i suppose you will soon set out for york  the lovely marchioness is to be there  is lady lawson to be of your party i could wish she were as i fear my dear emily may not be sufficiently attentive to her present situation  let me entreat you not to ride and to dance but little my true love attends your lord and with good wishes to all your party i am affectionately  yours f straffon  letter xv lady woodville to lady straffon i am not half satisfied with my dear fannys no comment on lady harriets affecting story  by making the case general you seem inclined to lessen the calamity  but a plague is a plague though ten thousand or only one thousand die of it and by extending its dominion you increase the fatality without abating our compassion for particular sufferers  again and again i say what a blessed happy creature is your emily had my dear lord after gaining trifled with my heart his triumph would soon have been complete for i really think the first wound must have subdued it but he who has penetration enough to see the softness of my nature has also generosity sufficient to prevent my very wishes and seems to have no fear but want of power to gratify them this is a theme on which my grateful heart could dwell for ever but not to tire you i shall change the subject  i find lord seymour vastly averse to our going to york  he has taken so much pains to dissuade me from it that if i had not promised fanny weston and sir james thornton whose hearts are set on going i should find great pleasure in sacrificing my own inclination to his lordship  yet he gives no solid reason for our declining his party  i perceive that my lord looks grave when the subject is mentioned of course it is immediately dropped and i find the boys and girls will be conquerors  even the grave lady harriet and mr ransford seemed to be alarmed while the matter appeared doubtful  i think i have as little curiosity as any of my sex yet i confess myself anxious to know lord seymours motive  he is a man of such excellent understanding and true politeness that i am astonished at his thinking differently even upon this trifling subject from my lord but avaunt thou first female vice curiosity i will not suffer thee to harbor one moment longer in my breast thou inhospitable tenant disturber of the peaceful mansion that receives thee  lady lawson will not accompany us to york she has been confined to her chamber for some days with a fever on her spirits a young lady whom she took into her house a distressed orphan five years ago and treated with the utmost tenderness has just left her this is unlucky as she is ill and alone sir william set out for london yesterday without calling upon us  the moment i have quitted one dear sister i shall fly to the other and spend as much time as i possibly can with her should she continue ill it will prevent my going to york i shall be only sorry for the occasion for i have lost all relish for the party  i know not what became of captain barnard the day he left us but i hear he is a constant visitor at ransfordhall  the old knight is laid up in the gout and her ladyship acts in the double capacity of master and mistress of the family  i hope sir john is by this time returned to you full of love and joy and admiration at your amazing prowess with regard to his children and that you are all as happy as you deserve and i  amen and adieu e woodville a thousand loves to lucy    letter xvi lady woodville to lady straffon my dear fanny as i have been used from my infancy to your tender participation of all my pains and pleasures i could not resist my inclination of sending you the enclosed which afforded me the most charming melange of both that i have ever met with i am proud and pleased that the writer was a woman but cannot help lamenting that such noble sentiments such an elegant turn of mind and above all such tender sensibility should be buried in a cloister  now for the means by which i obtained this treasure  yesterday evening after tea the conversation turned on the subject of letterwriting lord seymour advanced and was seconded by my lord that ladies in general wrote better in the epistolary style than men  as i looked upon such a declaration rather as a compliment paid to the present company than their real sentiments i took up the argument and though they mentioned several instances of charming female scribes all of whom i admire as much as they yet would i not allow the merit general  for those very persons whom they quoted are or ought to be as much distinguished from the rest of their sex for their superior talents as lady c  or the duchess of h  for their uncommon beauty  lord seymour politely called me an heretic against self conviction said he had observed my frequent use of the pen and was persuaded that no person with half my understanding was ever fond of writing who was not conscious of writing well i told his lordship if the conversation became particular there must be an end of the general argument he bowed and went on with repeating some passages from female letters which did honor to his taste and with which we were all charmed  he then told us that he had a letter in his pocket which he looked upon to be the chef daeuvre of female eloquence that he had found it as he was one morning taking a solitary walk in the tuilleries that he would permit me to read it provided i would heartily give him my opinion whether i thought any man living could dictate such a letter on my promising to be sincere he took it out of his pocketbook presented it to me with a trembling hand and left the room  when we met at supper i was lavish in its praise and declared that i doubted whether even rousseau could have wrote more tenderly he seemed delighted at my conversation and immediately complied with my request to suffer me to take a copy of it for you and you only  i impatiently long to know something more of the ladys history  i cannot be persuaded that it was mere accident which put it into lord seymours hands  but i will not detain you from the perusal of it by my vague conjectures  i shall however satisfy your curiosity in a more material point by letting you know lady lawson is better  i am to dine with her teteatete tomorrow  i shall claim great merit for this volunteer i hope lucy continues well i earnestly wish to know what apology you have made for that worthless idiot sir james miller to sir john pray write very soon a very long letter to  yours very sincerely e woodville the letter after a conflict of four months the mildest moment of which sad time was infinitely more painful than that which shall separate this feeble frame from its perturbed spirit i sit down to bid an everlasting adieu to him who was far dearer than the first and long maintained the scale in equal balance with the latter did i say was alas he is and ever will be dearer than my life which i would sacrifice a thousand times rather than wound his heart as i now must  unhappy henry what pangs what anguish will now rend thy bosom when thou shall be convinced thou never had a rival in thy charlottes love even heaven itself yielded its claim to thee and my fond heart adored the maker in his most perfect work thy charming self such in thy charlottes eyes did thou appear till thy relentless jealousy pursued and would have robbed of life  no rival henry but thy charlottes brother  how will amazement strike thee my sad heart bleeds for thine involved in mystery and mysery from my birth this truth could not have reached you sooner nor could i possibly reveal the secret and brand with cruelty and guilt the authors of my wretched being  recall the fatal evening to your mind when that accursed jealousy infused its venom first into your bosom  what pains did i not take to counteract the poison how was the innocent young man astonished at your behavior remember the last words i ever uttered to you  my dearest henry let not appearances disturb your mind i can and will account for every action of my life to you  let your servant attend at the grate tomorrow for a letter from me and you shall be fully satisfied  ah henry how could you doubt her truth who never yet deceived you by what you now must feel judge what i felt when word was brought me you had killed my brother that he survives for your sake and my own i bow my heart to heaven ah what uncommon misery were mine were i compelled to hate you no henry i am not so wtetched i may love you still without a crime most truly love you and every prayer that i address to heaven may wast petitions for your true felicity  tomorrow i renounce the world vain ceremony alas i have renounced my henry before  this is my last adieu  may every saint and angel bless protect and guide you to that heaven where we may once more hope to meet  till then farewell for ever        letter xvii lady straffon to lady woodville i am vastly obliged to my dear emily for her two last letters  her volunteer was delightful  that angelic nun has almost broke my heart  it is impossible she can be happy in a cloister and i very much doubt whether those fine feelings which she seems to have would not have rendered her rather more miserable had she remained in the world may she soon arrive at that place where the highest sensibility must be productive of the highest happiness  you will perhaps think me cruel for wishing her death but indeed my dear sister there is scarce a man living who could deserve such a heart as hers not even lord seymour to whom i believe it devoted if i read aright i am trully sorry for his misfortune he has sustained an irreparable loss  i dare say your lord is acquainted with the whole story and as i am persuaded that lord seymour is incapable of a base or mean action he may perhaps be prevailed on to satisfy your curiosity  but if he once declines it press him no farther as you value his peace and your own never lay him under the painful necessity of refusing any thing to the woman he loves nor let him ever see you have a wish ungratified believe me emily more women lose their husbands hearts by what they call carrying their point and teizing a good natured man into compliance than any other way  the first part of this letter like the gazette has been devoted to foreign affairs now for domestic  sir john returned last week in perfect health and spirits from paris i did not suffer the children to appear till i acquainted him with my bold undertaking  at first he looked surprised and terrified but immediately recollecting himself said that from his fannys countenance he was certain our joint treasure must be safe at that instant the little animals flew into his arms i cannot describe the charming scene but it was as you say all love and joy and admiration  lucy came next she had summoned all her spirits to meet her brother but in spite of all her resolution a wayward tear stole down her lovely cheek to our mutual surprise sir john took not the least notice of her soft confusion nor asked a single question about sir james miller lucy was vastly happy at his seeming inattention but it alarmed me much more than if he had spoken upon the subject  a little time after he withdrew into his closet and wrote at letter  his servant returned as we were sitting down to dinner and told him the gentleman was not at home during our meal i felt the utmost anxiety but durst not speak lucy was the exact resemblance of shakespeares patience on a monument smiling at grief sir john appeared to be perfectly at ease cheerful and lively  i observed to him that he talked much and eat little he pressed my hand with unaffected tenderness and said the joy he felt at seeing us all had quite absorded any thought of himself but that nature would soon return to its old bent and bid me beware of my beef and mutton tomorrow  i knew the loss of appetite to be a common effect of joy and therefore endeavored to persuade myself that all was well when we arose from table he said he had some business to transact for a gentleman in paris but that he shoud return to tea and desired lucy to have her voice and harpsichord in tune to sing him some new songs he then put on his sword and walked briskly out of the house  lucy and i remained for some moments petrified we could neither speak nor lok at each other  at length she arose and with a slow peace and downcast looks advanced to where i sat then fell upon her knees before me and bathed my hand with her fastfalling tears i could not bid her rise but sunk down by her and joined in fervent prayer for my husband and her brothers safety  a thousand times the dear unhappy girl implored my pardon as though she were the guilty cause of what i did or might hereafter suffer her anguish seemed unutterable and alarmed and distressed as i then was i found it absolutely necessary to conceal my own fears and speak peace to her distracted tortured mind  in less than an hour sir john relieved us from this shocking state  at the transporting sound of his voice we endeavored to compose ourselves  lucy flew to open the door of the parlour where we had remained during his absence she rushed into his arms and fainted there the strong transition overpowered her every faculty and it was a considerable time before she showed any signs of life i do not blush to tell you that sir john wept over his beloved sister  as soon as she had power of articulation she gazed intently on her brother and exclaimed where is the unhappy man and do i see my dearest brother safe and unstained with blood  my dear lucy sir john replied calm your spirits  you need have no apprehensions either for sir james miller or for me  he is fallen below my resentment and you might have been assured from the first that any man who dared to treat a woman ill must be a coward in his heart  but did you meet cried lucy no said sir john and i will answer for it we never shall if he can avoid it and i promise you i shall not seek the wretch  but pray sir john said i how came you acquainted with his ungenerous behavior as vice and folly are generally connected replied sir john he was weak enough to inform against himself by a letter which he wrote to me at paris some time after his marriage and concluded it with presenting lady millers compliments and hoping that notwithstanding what had passed we might still be friends and live upon good terms  in my answer i told him that though sighting had formerly been my profession i was neither a bully nor a bravo and if he could acquit himself with honor of a breach of faith to a woman of unquestioned merit i was ready to accord him the friendship he desired but as i looked upon that to be impossible i hoped he would at least be ready to afford me the only satisfaction that remained in his power to offer or mine to receive that i should leave paris in a few days and call upon him as soon as i arrived in london  i saw his servant near this house when i alighted and i have reason to think he was placed there to watch my coming as sir james and his lady set out in a few minutes after for paris and i think there now ramains nothing but to wish my dear lucy joy of her escape from such a contemptible animal  i am indeed my dear brother said lucy truly joyful  what a wretch should i have been if any misfortune had befallen you on my account how could i ever have looked upon my more than sister or her little ang babes sir john and i endeavored to change the subject but lucy frequently recurred to it  ah emily her wounds are not yet healed we spent the evening in a kind of pleasing melancholy  though our hearts were at peace our spirits were too much agitated to be cheerful i proposed our setting out for straffon hill next day but sir john seemed inclined to stay for a few days longer as i have now no apprehensions from sir james miller i can have no objection though i confess i long for pure air and peace two charming things which are never to be found in a great city  i congratulate you on lady lawsons recovery how does poor lady harriet have you civilized sir james thornton i mean has he yet fallen in love what is fanny weston doing i shall think her much to blame if she does not make a conquest  the country is the place to inspire sentiment  in london we think of nothing but outward show  happiness is entirely out of the question may it long continue to reside at woodfort sincerely wishes  your f straffon ps what an amazing long letter but i am never tired of conversing with you  sir john and my lucy and my babes all send you their loves    letter xviii lady woodville to lady straffon my dear fanny you very aptly compare your last letter to a newspaper which records facts indiscriminately  how could you possibly think of the charming nun however engaging or affecting her situation and thence proceed to a sober lecture on matrimony before you mentioned events so interesting as those which related to sir john lucy and yourself you are certainly a perfect stoic and i begin to fear you will soon be above lifes weakness and its comforts too you see how gladly i lay hold of the first opportunity i ever had to criticize on you i have no doubt but you will explain away all my objections by next post but in the mean time i shall fully enjoy that self given consequence and superiority which we all assume when we take the liberty of condemning another persons conduct  but to be serious both my lord and i are charmed with sir john  his tenderness for his amiable sister sets his bravery in the strongest light  and you really did not blush to record it my dear fanny must have a great deal of effiontery notwithstanding her modest countenance and her meek air i am in such high spirits at the happy conclusion of this disagreeable affair that i cannot command my pen to write one rational line  yes it shall tell you that all this family congratulate our dear lucy and you but more particularly her on her lucky escape from that contemptible wretch sir james miller and though we all hope and believe ourselves to be very good christians there is not one of us would lament his untimely end if he should be detected in picking pockets in paris and make his exit at the greve  and so my dear wise sister very prudently warned me against teazing my lord  it was a proper caution and i shall use it  am not i very obedient but she left me at full liberty to torment any one else  i shall use this latitude also to begin  i must inform you that i am in full possession of the history of our lovely nun and unrestrained from communicating it to you yet shall i not gratify your curiosity which i am certain is as great as mine until you are brought to confess it and provoked to say psha emily how can you be so teizing  i must now hasten to your queries as we are going to dine at lord witherss four miles off i have prevailed on lady lawson to be of the party sir william is not returned from london yet i do believe sir james thornton is in love though we cannot guess with whom he is lately become thoughtful and reserved we rally him on his gravity and tell him he is proud melancholy and gentleman like though he has lost his cheerfulness his good humor is invincible and he strives to laugh whenever he thinks we wish he should  i much fear that cupid has played at crossbow amongst our young folks and dealt out left handed arrows i fear poor fanny weston is a stricken deer and am apprehensive that the hand which gave will never heal the wound she sits whole evenings alone in her chamber listening to an aeolian harp and sometimes looks as if she had been in tears she says she will go to london from york but i fancy she may as well return to woodfort as all our male inmates will have left us  lord seymour talks of going to the hot wells at bristol in a few days and sir james thornton goes from york to his own seat in the west lady harriet continues pretty much the same except when captain barnard is mentioned which happens too frequently as he still visits at lady ransfords  adieu dear fanny the coach is ready and sir james thornton waiting in the antichamber of the dressing room to hand me to it i cannot help laughing at the idea of her grave face a thousand loves attend sir john lucy and the babes  once more adieu e woodville  letter xix lady straffon to lady woodville straffonhill it is a remark much to the honor of human nature that happiness creates benevolence i am therefore pleased with the illustrating it by telling you that the calm and rational delight i receive from my present happy situation has rendered my mind so placid and serene as to prevent my resenting your ladyships sarcastical comment on my last letter au contraire i am pleased at your becoming a critic as i think you want a little of that self given consequence which is sometimes necessary to give us weight with others  but now to prove to you that i am not stoic enough to be indifferent about your good opinion i must inform you that the first part of my last letter was wrote a few minutes before sir johns arrival the remainder the day after and as i know my dear emilys weak spirits are too apt to be alarmed i chose to proceed in continuation in hopes that by seeming to treat the matter lightly i might prevent her apprehensions and this remarkable instance of my delicacy has her pretty little ladyship construed into a total want of feeling but you love fair la guerre and now look to yourself  i never pretended to be devoid of curiosity it is a passion inherent to our natures and properly conducted may be productive of every good  it is the source of knowledge and in my mind the strongest mark of distinction between the rational and brute creation  it is our birth right descended to us from our first mother  you will perhaps say it is an inheritance we might have dispensed with as it has certainly cost us too dear yet as i have already said if well cultivated it is a fruitful soil but in the hands of the weak or the idle it can bring forth nothing but weeds or thorns  against this kind of produce i warned my emily and still warn her lest they at any time should wound her tender heart i frankly confess myself interested in the fate of your lovely nun but instead of saying as you would have me psha emily how can you be so teizing i shall say pray emily do not be teizing but write me a full and true account of every circumstance you know relating to the charming vestal and of every thing else that you think can afford any entertainment to  your affectionate sister f straffon  letter xx lady woodville to lady straffon what a triumph for such a little insignificant animal as me to be able to ruffle the calm dignity of a female philosopher i shall begin to think myself of some consequence rather of more weight than the fly upon the chariot wheel for indeed my dear fanny notwithstanding your efforts to disguise it you were a little chagrined at the small attempt toward pertness which i ventured to make in my last letter and in truth you wise ones when once thrown off your guard make as foolish a figure as any of us simpletons  i have heard it said that a person who never learnt to fence shall be able to disconcert the greatest master of that noble science nay more may possibly kill him by a random pass while he stands in the best posture of defense and is aiming at his antagonist in all the profundity of quarte or tierce just such a scrambling combatant have you to deal with who without the least skill in the art of logic presumes to enter the lists with your wise ladyship  and so fanny curiosity is now become a virtue productive of every good the source of knowledge the distinguishing mark of rationality an inheritance descended to us etc and yet poor emily is not to be allowed the use of this treasure but to be deprived of her birthright and treated as an absolute alien to our grandmother eve is not this a little hard  but now what says my philosophy to this severe treatment i think i see you laugh at that expression but pray madam is not the great use and end of that exalted study to render us happy by perfectly acquiescing in our own lot and wisely contemning all those advantages that are denied us grant me but this and i will immediately prove myself a philosopher by showing you how differently we think in regard to this same treasure called curiosity which i am not permitted to have any share of  and first i absolutely deny that it ever was or can be productive of good au contraire i have scripture on my side to prove that it was the original cause of every physical and moral ill that has happened in this world for i know not how many thousand years you say it is inherent to our natures fie fanny could the author of good then have punished dame eve and all her descendants merely for following the bent of that nature he had himself endued her with  impossible  i say it was the devil who first introduced it into paradise and infected poor eve for it certainly is contagious and never to be eradicated from her then it has descended to all her offspring not as an inheritance though but rather as an uncancellable mortgage upon their natural patrimony  you say it is the source of knowledge there again my dear you are unluckily mistaken  pride is undoubtedly the first motive for not to be wise but to be thought wiser than our neighbors is the great reward a distinguishing mark of rationality you are really no philosopher lady straffon  have you never seen a dog or cat raise up their ears and listen with all the avidity with which an old maid hearkens to a scandalous report of some blooming beauty of eighteen indeed my dear you must have observed this frequently and i am firmly persuaded that those animals i have mentioned are just as instinctively curious as any duchess in christendom  i think i have now fairly demolished all your arguments in favor of this precious commodity but as you boast the possession of it which i believe no woman ever did but yourself i will show myself the paragon of good nature and gratify the weakness i condemn by telling you the history of our amiable nun  how unlucky now for your poor dear curiosity lady ransford has this moment alighted  i must fly to receive her and bid you  adieu e woodville  letter xxi lady straffon to lady woodville and so my pretty little bizarre you are really delighted at having ruffled a female philosopher and from thence are determined to derive selfconsequence helas ma pauvre enfant how grieved am i to mortify by undeceiving you for i cannot help informing you though i know it to be cruel that i have never been so much pleased with any of your letters as your two last  brought up from your early infancy with a high deference for my opinions which for some years past i have wished you to shake off lest it should prevent the free use of your own understanding and occasion your receiving notions upon trust without giving yourself the trouble of examining them i am delighted to find that my dear emily will though in pure badinage exert her reason and argue it not logically at least ingeniously  go on my lively opponent and push the mock war between us as far as it will go though inded you have left me little to say on the subject of curiosity except that it was certainly the original source of knowledge however unmeritorious as it first induced eves trespass in tasting the forbidden fruit but i think we have fairly exhausted this thesis and now for quelque chose denouveau  sir john has received a letter from sir james miller wherein he entreats that sir john will not banish him his native land by keeping up any resentment against him he implores lucys pardon and is mean enough to give hints that his crime has been his punishment poor abject wretch sir john has assured him that he never can feel resentment for a person he despises so that he may return to england in perfect safety  this last contemptible maneuver of sir james has i think completed lucys cure her faded charms begin to recover their former luster and i had the pleasure of overhearing her singing a very lively air as she walked just now under my window are not these good symptoms my fair philosopher  no friendly visitant has broke in upon me to interrupt the tediousness of this epistle but the clock has just reminded me of an appointment i made with my edward and emily to take them to our park exact punctuality should ever be preserved in promises made to those who are not capable of judging of the reasons which might be given for a breach of it  i therefore must fly to them and bid my dear emily  adieu f straffon  letter xxii lady woodville to lady straffon my dear fanny i am heartily glad that the mock war as you call it between us is at an end as i should at present be totally unable to support my share in the combat and of course must fall before the conqueror i have been unusually dispirited and languid for these two days  i feel as if i had cause to be melancholy and yet endeavor to persuade myself that i have none this is a state not to be described and to you who i dare say have never experienced it may appear ridiculous and yet believe me it is a painful situation  but i flatter myself i have rather caught than bred this malady  lord seymour left us this morning and for some days before he set out he seemed to have acquired an additional degree of melancholy softness love he can never feel more  besides my lord seems infected with the same disorder looks grave and sighs tell me then fanny is it possible that male friendship is so much more delicate and tender than ours that their mutual sadness could arise from a separation for a few weeks or perhaps months if this should be the real cause i shall blush for my own want of sensibility  i should think lord seymour in such a state of mind that no slight or trivial misfortune could possibly affect him for they who have once felt real anguish may bid defiance to future ills the arrows of adversity may glance against but cannot wound a heart already broken from sympathy alone such minds can suffer  but oh far far be the thought from emilys fond bosom that lord woodvilles sufferings should cause lord seymours sorrow it is impossible i am sorry i have expressed such a thought even to you my sister i would blot it from the paper if i could erase it from my mind  we had last night a concert in a temple dedicated to apollo in the garden  my lord whose voice is harmony itself was singing one of shenstones elegies i accompanied him on the harpsichord and lord seymour on the violoncello  at these words  she was fair and i could not but love  she is faithless and i am undone i saw lord seymour fix his eyes on lord woodvilles face which in a moment became suffused with crimson his voice faltered so much that he could scarce finish the song  the moment it was ended he quitted the temple i felt myself alarmed i feared he was taken ill and went immediately toward the house as i crossed the parterre i saw him walking briskly in a path that leads to the wood this quieted my apprehensions for his health but left my mind in a state incapable of thinking  i retired to my chamber and continued to muse till summoned to supper  there was no notice taken of what had passed  we parted earlier than usual all but lord seymour and my lord who continued together till near four oclock i could not sleep and wished to have risen and either walked or read but was unwilling to discover my restlessness to him who caused it when we met at breakfast mr ransford who was just arrived from london asked my lord in a low voice if i had been ill as he observed that i looked much paler than usual  what a flutter am i in just as i had wrote the last word my dear lord opened the door and said he came to request the pleasure of my company to see a new improvement he is making and with the most engaging affability added that he feared he had disturbed my rest by sitting up so late but thought an airing would do us both good  his behavior has made all the foregoing part of my letter appear a vision to me do not reply to it my fanny till you hear from me again and i hope by next post to have forgot i ever wrote it  adieu adieu that i may fly indeed to the most amiable of men  e woodville ps you shall have the little history of the nun with my next  i rejoice at lucys recovery  happy happy may you all be    letter xxiii lady woodville to lady straffon my dearest fanny the cloud that hung over my mind is totally dispersed and my happiness restored with my reason what a visionary must you think me but do not chide me my loved sister lest by endeavoring at a justification i should fancy i had found reason to support my folly  i never spent so delightful a day as the last on which i wrote to you during our airing which was about six miles my lord appeared if possible more amiable to me than ever there was a peculiar air of tenderness diffused through his voice and manner perhaps the parting from his friend had softened his already gentle nature perhaps  but why pry into his bosom in search of a cause which might render the effect less pleasing  in less than an hour we arrived at the neatest and most elegant cottage i ever beheld it was seated on the declivity of a hill and defended from the north winds by a small wood so beautifully variegated that even in this leafy season summer autumn and winter seemed to vye in the luxuriancy of the different shades which their several periods produce  before the house a pendant lawn covered with sheep and lambs reached to the river which winded in the most beautiful mazes round the hill over the broadest part of it was a gothic bridge of one arch with a watch tower in the center and on the other side of the house stood a small nursery and shrubbery  i was never more agreeably surprised than with this lovely scene i really think if i was to meet with any severe affliction that i should like to retire to this delightful solitude and pass my days in it  i frequently saw my lords eyes sparkle with pleasure at that which i expressed as i neither saw or heard a human creature but ourselves i begged to know who were the happy owners of this lovely spot said i wished to see and congratulate them on their taste and felicity  he said he would immediately comply with my request and by so doing increase the happiness of its possessors  he then led me to the house which was as simply elegant within as without  i think i never saw perfect neatness before  and presented me to his nurse an extreme good looking woman about fifty  she knew not in what manner to receive me  humility and joy seemed to struggle in her countenance  i stepped forward and embraced her  my lord seemed delighted at what he was pleased to call my condescension  the good woman has been a widow for twelve years her husband was first gardener to my lords father and her son inlaw is now in the same station with us her daughter is a very pretty woman about two and twenty and ready to lie in of a second child i never beheld such a cherubim as the first my lord said archly he hoped his foster sister and i should be better acquainted and that she would undertake the same good office for me that her mother had done for his  the poor girl blushed and curtsyed i felt my cheeks glow and walked to the window  i confess i was charmed with his intention to such a point which the foolish lords of the creation generally think below them he then inquired for the nurses mother and the finest old woman i ever saw came into the room  i saluted her also  her hair was perfectly silver and her skin like down  she blessed and embrassed my lord while tears of joy and gratitude ran down her fair unfurrowed cheek  my lord was affected and saw me sow and in order to change the subject told the good woman of the house he was come to dine with her  she looked amazed and so should i had i then thought him serious  but i found he was so when he told her she could certaily give us good bread butter rashers and eggs and a sallad and that he would take care of the rest  i smiled assent but said we should send home to prevent the company waiting he said there was no necessity for it as he was quite satisfied that our friends at woodfort would sit down to dinner at the same instant that we did without hearing from us i then supposed he had left orders that they should not wait and was pleased with the idea of our simple rustic meal but i was to be still more surprised for in about ten minutes the coach arrived with lady harriet fany weston sir james thornton and mr ransford a sumpter car followed with wine and cold provisions  the beauty of the scene the fineness of the day the unpremeditatedness of the scheme all conspired to render us more cheerful than we should have been perhaps in any other place on earth and we all returned home delighted with our little expedition and full of gratitude to my lord for the pleasure it had afforded us  this is an enormous long letter but you taught me to rise early i can therefore spare time to my absent friends as well as those about me and i can never think that time better employed than in proving to my dearest fanny that i am  her truly affectionate sister e woodville ps i fear i have delayed the history i now send you too long perhaps your curiosity may be as much palled as ones appetite sometimes is by waiting for a second course which though elegant in itself cannot repair the damage done by the delay but if you are a true epicure and like the feast you will feed heartily though the tediousness of the cook be ever so teizing to you  the history of miss charlotte beaumont as the chief circumstances which relate to this lady refer more to others than herself we must look back to the first causes of those effects which seem to have marked her fate unhappy in the very article of her birth though descended from a noble family it will be necessary to give some account of the authors of her being  her father the present general beaumont was the youngest son of one of the most ancient and illustrious houses in france but as is generally the case with the superfluous branches of great families of that nation he was possessed of no other patrimony than his high birth a graceful person and his sword  the church and the army are the only provisions which seem to be designed for the cadets of the noblesse to the latter our young soldier of fortune applied himself and soon obtained a genteel post there in this situation the then duchess dowager of h  saw and was captivated with our young hero  though her age more than doubled his her person was still pleasing and her fortune so infinitely superior to his most sanguine hopes that he did not long hesitate to accept such a splendid establishment  they passed some years together with that polite indifference which distinguishes the married couples of high rank in that gay nation at length the duchess began to grow weary of treading the same dull circle for so many years and proposed to the general they should visit one of her estates in languedoc and pass a summer there though he was by no means tired of the grande monde nor could possibly form any very delightful idea of retirement with such a companion as her grace he politely assented to her request  when they had been some time in the country the duchess hinted a desire of sending for a young lady who was a distant relation of her first husbands and whom she had formerly placed in a convent this proposal was perfectly agreeable to the general the most desirable tetes a tetes sometimes grow languid but the intervension of a third person in such a situation as theirs was most devoutly to be wished for  her grace set out the next morning for the convent de  which was about five leagues from her seat and returned in the evening accompanied by the too lovely charlotte detree  the general though well accustomed to the power of beauty became suddenly captivated  never had he beheld such a face and form before  such simple elegance such unaffected grace the beauties of venus with dians modesty  while the lovely charlotte felt at least as much surprise at the sight of him we have already said his person was remarkably graceful his air at once engaging and commanding nor was any outward ornament neglected that could put off such a form to the best advantage  what an amazing effect must such a figure have upon a girl not yet seventeen who had been bred in a cloister and had never seen or at least conversed with any man who did not wear a cowl  the duchess attempted to appologize for charlottes astonishment by observing that the poor girl had been brought up in an absolute ignorance but hoped when she had been some time with her that her awkward amazement would wear off she might have talked for ever without interruption the general had neither speech nor hearing his faculties seemed all absorbed in one and through his eyes alone his heart was for the first time taught to feel a real passion  the little wanton god too much the generals friend soon inspired the innocent and fair detree with the same sentiments never did the tyrant reign more absolute than in the hearts of these his willing slaves whole months passing away in all the delights of mutual fondness seemed to the lovers but a day and when at the end of autumn the duchess talked of returning to paris it appeared to them like being doomed to banishment  charlotte was to accompany the duchess thither but the general knew their interviews must be less frequent and more liable to interruption than in the charming solitude of belle veue after every excuse was obviated and every possible contrivance of delay exhausted they were forced to submit and the once gay and lively charles beaumont set out for the metropolis with infinitely more regret than he had quitted it the duchess was happily not of a jealous nature and the enamoured pair behaved with so much circumspection that she never seemed to have the least suspicion of their mutual attachment to the last hour of her life  the natural consequences of their guilty love now began to make charlotte taste the bitter ingredients of that intoxicating cup of which she had drank so deeply infamy stared her in the face and though a criminal passion had triumphed over chastity her modesty was not yet extinguished sleepless nights and days of anguish now became her portion she detested herself and all the world all but the guilty author of her misery how often did she wish she never had quitted the cloister but there like the desert rose have bloomed and died unseen in innocence and peace  the general whose fondness if possible was increased by her situation said every thing in his power to console her by promising to secure her fame many were the expedients he thought of but none of them seemed sufficient to satisfy the delicate apprehensions of the unhappy charlotte at length she recollected that there was a young woman in the convent where she had been bred whose father and mother were dead and had left her in such low circumstances that she could neither afford to live in the world or pay her pension where she remained and was therefore under the painful necessity of taking the veil contrary to her inclinations or of going into the world as a dependent  this person then she fixed upon as a consederate and immediately wrote to her to come to paris with ample promises of taking care of her future fortune mademoiselle laval was overjoyed at such a summons and instantly obeyed it in the mean time the general hired a very neat furnished house for her reception and appointed servants and every thing proper for her arrival  she was informed that she was to personate a lady whose husband was just dead and who was come from a distant part of normandy to prosecute a lawsuit and lie in at paris  the unhappy situation of this young womans circumstances made her readily acquiesce in every thing that charlotte required and she entered her house with all the melancholy solemnity of an afflicted relict in a few days after her arrival the real mourner the poor wretched charlotte went to visit her and after shedding a flood of tears upon her bosom acquainted her with her unhappy situation and implored her assistance  mademoiselle laval naturally good natured and softened by the unhappy condition of her friend promised every thing she could desire  endeavored to soothe and comfort her affliction and at last settled matters in such a way that the moment charlotte found herself taken ill she was to go there that every necessary preparation should he made and every tender care taken of her and her offspring  every thing happened to their utmost wishes she was taken ill as she was dressing to go to a ball at the english ambassadors the duches was luckily prevented from going by a slight cold and charlotte when she got into the carriage had no one to oppose her being set down where she pleased  she went directly to her friends house and was there happily delivered of a son and daughter who were immediately baptized by the names of charles and charlotte  in as short a time as was possible after this event the general and one of his particular friends carried charlotte home in a sedan chair she said she had been taken ill at the ball and went directly to bed where she continued for some days and to carry on the deceit mademoiselle laval confined herself to her bed and went through all the forms of a real accouchement  this great event so well over the general thought himself the happiest man living  he doated on his children and perfectly adored their lovely mother  but she continued to appear gloomy and dejected and at last declared she should never know peace while the living witnesses of her shame continued in the same kingdom with her she seldom saw them and when she did expressed abhorrence rather than tenderness toward them she behaved with the utmost coldness to the general and affected to be infinitely more miserable than she had ever been before  the general was almost distracted at her conduct and at length consented to the removal of the children it was agreed that laval should go over to england take upon her the name of beaumont and educate them as her own till the duchess died  as soon as that should happen he promised to marry charlotte and receive them as the orphans of a near relation  in the mean time he settled a very handsome income on laval and the little innocents set out for london with their fictitious mother who felt however infinitely more tenderness for them than their real one seemed to have done  nothing remarkable happened during their infancy mademoiselle laval by the generals recommendation became acquainted with any families of distinction and though quite unacquainted with the word behaved herself so properly that she was as much esteemed as known and her lovely children universally admired  when they were about seven years old the duchess died and in as short a space as decency would admit of the general fulfilled his promise to his still adored and beautiful charlotte on this occasion mademoiselle laval who really doated on her amiable charge felt the tenderest concern at the thoughts of parting with it  but she might have spared her sorrow for madame de beaumont was by no means inclined to rob her of it on the contrary when the general proposed the childrens return she grew outrageous and declared she would never see him more if he attempted to bring them into any part of france she was born to rule his fate and he submitted though reluctantly to her inhuman and unnatural commands  in about ten months after their marriage she brought him a son which in some measure consoled him for the loss of his other children and in another year presented him with a daughter in a little time his fondness was wholly transferred to the objects of her adoration  never was so fond a mother and madame de beaumont was looked upon as the pattern of maternal affection while she not only abandoned but detested her former offspring  the generals letters to laval became less frequent and though he punctually remitted her income he seldom mentioned those for whose use it was designed in vain poor laval endeavored to awaken the tender feelings of a father in his heart by boasting the amazing beauty of his charlotte or mentioning the fine parts and accomplishments of his amiable charles nature seemed dead in him as much as in their cruel mother  at length worn by the perpetual remonstrances of the humane and generou laval he obtained a commission for his son who was then about sixteen in a regiment that was to embark from dunkirk for america but sent strict orders that he should not go to paris and conjured laval to keep him still ignorant of his birth  poor charlotte almost died away at the thoughts of being separated from her brother it was the first cause she had ever known for sorrow and nature seemed inclined to make them both amends for the loss of parental affection by bestowing a double portion of fraternal love on each  our young soldier whose ardor for glory was extreme was all gratitude to his supposed mother for suffering him to follow the bent of his inclination and at the appointed time he quitted london with a heart filled at once with bravery and tenderness  in order to divert the melancholy which affected charlotte for her brothers absence lady sandford invited the feigned mademoiselle de beaumont and her supposed daughter to pass some time at her seat in the country the invitation was readily accepted and there charlotte now in her seventeenth year first saw lord seymour  her beauty was then only in its dawn but even then like aurora breaking through the clouds it gave a promise of the brightest day the tender regret she felt for her brothers absence gave an additional softness to her voice and manners and the expressive sensibility of her large hazel eyes seemed increased by her gentle distress  such an amiable object could not fail of inspiring passion in a heart less susceptible than lord seymours or indeed any heart that was not guarded by a prepossession he soon felt the most ardent and sincere affection for her nor was he the only person who was sensible of the power of her charms the young duke of b  saw her at a ball at northampton and became instantly enamoured  he waited on lady sandford in a few days after and with all the precipitancy of youth high rank and fortune proposed himself to mademoiselle de beaumont for her daughter  whether charlottes delicacy was really hurt by such a proceeding or whether she then felt a preference for lord seymour she instantly rejected the dukes proposal with an air of fierte unknown to her before mademoiselle de beaumont who tenderly loved her acquiesced in her determination and resolved not to acquaint her real parents that such a match had been proposed  charlotte was transported at her feigned mothers kind condescension and promised the most implicit obedience which indeed she had ever shown to all her commands she began now to recover her spirits was all cheerfulness and vivacity and from this pleasing transition she acquired if possible new charms and each and every day lord seymour became more and more enamoured  the two happiest months of charlottes life were now passed and mademoiselle de beaumont talked of returning to london before they set out lord seymour found an opportunity of disclosing his passion to charlotte she received his declaration with that frankness and candor that ever dwell with generous minds but at the same time told him that she considered herself under such obligations to her mother for her conduct toward her in regard to the duke of b  that she would never listen to any persons addresses who had not the sanction of her approbation  the enamoured seymour whose passion was as truly delicate as the fair object that inspired it was now at the summit of felicity  he threw himself at charlottes feet and poured forth his soul in the warmest expressions of gratitude for her generous and unaffected behavior and at the same time obtained her leave to apply to mademoiselle de beaumont for her consent as soon as they should return to london  he was permitted the happiness of attending them thither and the day after their arrival waited on mademoiselle de beaumont to entreat her leave to pay his addresses to her lovely daughter true love is ever timid and conscious as lord seymour was that the advantage of birth and fortune were on his side he felt perhaps more apprehensions on this occasion than a young ensign would at addressing a lady of the highest rank  all that he knew of chorlottes circumstances or condition was that her mother passed for the widow of a general officer that her fortune was small but sufficient to support her little family genteelly with economy and that she had maintained an unblemished reputation in london for near seventeen years  but how were the generous and disinterested seymours fears increased when mademoiselle de beaumont told him she was highly sensible of the honor he intended her daughter but that she thought her yet too young to marry and that she had laid herself under an engagement never to dispose of charlotte without first consulting her fathers family and friends she conjured him as a man of honor not to mention his passion to charlotte as by inspiring her with a mutual one he might perhaps render them both miserable  lord seymour instantly told her it was out of his power to obey her injunction as it was by charlottes permission he had then the honor of entreating her consent and that he neither could nor would desist from endeavoring to gain a heart on which all his happiness in this life depended mademoiselle de beaumont was moved even to tears at the unhappy situation of the lovers she too plainly saw the obstacles that must prevent their union but generously promised and resolved to do every thing in her power for their mutual happiness  lord seymour ventured to remonstrate to her that with regard to the duke of b  s proposal she had acted as sole parent and guardian of her daughter and he could not see the necessity of farther consultation for accepting than refusing a lover she owned her tenderness for charlotte had in that case triumphed over her promise but she had even then only assumed a negative power which was more in right of her daughter than herself for she never could think it just that either parents or friends should even persuade a person to marry contrary to their own inclinations she told him she would write immediately to france and represent his lordships birth fortune and person in the advantageous light in which she beheld them  exalted as his ideas were of the object of his passion he had great reason to flatter himself that his alliance would not be contemned by any family in france and when he considered that the exquisite perfections of his charming charlotte must he unknown to those persons who were to be consulted in the disposal of them his fears would sometimes vanish and his fond heart beat with all the transporting hopes of successful love  charlotte who had never heard mademoiselle de beaumont talk of her fathers family till now considered the difficulties that were started in another light and fancied she only meant them to protract the marriage till she should be eighteen which she had often heard her say was full early for a young lady to marry however without enquiring she perfectly acquiesced in her supposed mothers conduct and while she had the happiness of seeing and hearing the tenderest of lovers and most charming of men she knew not a wish ungratified mademoiselle de beaumont fulfilled her promise by writing immediately to the general and mentioning lord seymour in the justest and of course most pleasing light  it happened that the general and his lady were at that time at aix la chapelle where he had been seized with a violent fever and though the letter was forwarded to him as the characters of the superscription were known by his lady it lay for sometime unopened  during this interval the fictitious mademoiselle de beaumont was attacked by the smallpox which appeared of so malignant a sort that her fate was quickly pronounced by her physicians as soon as she was acquainted with her disorder she forbad charlotte to come near her as she had never had it but in vain she commanded or lord seymour entreated her to absent herself a moment from her bedside she said it was her first and should be her last act of disobedience and for that reason she hoped her dear and tender parent would pardon it  overcome by her filial piety they suffered her to undergo such constant and violent fatigue as at any other time would have destroyed her delicate and beauteous frame but she supported it with such a tender alacrity and attention as amazed and affected every one who saw her even lord seymours love was increased by his admiration of her virtues and rose almost to adoration  when mademoiselle de beaumont was informed of her danger which was but a few hours before her death she desired to be left alone with charlotte  after embracing and imploring blessings on her she told her that neither her time nor strength would permit her revealing a secret that was of the utmost consequence to her but as she had ever endeavored to be prepared for the tremendous event that was now come to pass she had kept a journal of her life from the time she quitted the convent de  to the moment of her illness that in those papers she would find her own history included and that of her real parents  charlotte though drowned in tears was all attention till those astonishing words her real parents smote her ear  she then cried out ah madam will you not only abandon but deny me alas what has your charlotte done be comforted my more than daughter she replied i was not worthy of such a blessing  yet still i hope more worthy than they who possess so rich a treasure regardless of its value but if their hearts so long hardened to your blooming virtues at length relent and give you to the worthy seymour you will have no cause to regret their past neglect or court their future protection may you be happy this key taking one from her bosom will explain what i cannot and now adieu for ever  the sudden effects of surprise joined to those of grief quite overcame the afflicted charlotte  she fainted and was conveyed senseless to her own apartment madmoiselle de beaumont continued to breathe till she heard charlotte was restored to life then yielded up her own  the next day charlotte was seized with convulsions and immediately after the smallpox appeared but of a safe and gentle kind  the malignity of the disorder had spent its force upon mademoiselle de beaumont and the low state both of charlottes mind and body rendered its operations less powerful lord seymour never quitted her apartment though not permitted to enter her chamber nor could he be prevailed on even to rest himself on a couch till the physicians pronounced her out of danger  as soon as it was possible she saw him he appeared more altered than herself never was such an interview between two lovers their present loss of beauty seemed to augment their fondness and each felt more real tenderness for the other than at any former instant of their lives lord seymour though he lamented the death of mademoiselle de beaumont very sincerely now thought that every bar to his happiness was removed and as charlotte appeared to be the mistress of her own fate he had no apprehensions that his could be unhappy  she had laughed at madame de beaumonts superstitious attachment to distant relations whom she had not seen for many years he therefore could not suspect her being inefcted with the same caprice the mother said she was bound by solemn engagements to the family of beaumont the daughter could have entered into none as she left paris when an infant he had therefore no reason to imagine that any power on earth could oppose his felicity and indulged his fond imagination with respective views of fancied bliss which he was fated never to enjoy  the smallpox had been so favorable to charlotte that she had not been affected with the least mark or alteration of feature and the natural whiteness of her snowy skin soon triumphed over the transitory redness which is the common effect of that always disagreeable and sometimes fatal disorder  but though her beauty had returned her cheerfulness seemed buried in mademoiselle de beaumonts tomb her affliction for her as a parent would perhaps have subsided into a calm and gentle melancholy but her last words had raised a tumult in her bosom which she had not resolution sufficient to conquer she frequently endeavored to persuade herself that her dear mother had raved in her last moments but the strength of her expression and calmness of her manner opposed that fond belief  after her recovery whole weeks elapsed without her having courage to open the cabinet where the mystery of her fate lay concealed she feared to meet with new obstacles to that happiness which she had promised herself by being united to lord seymour  his delicacy had yet prevented him from expressing his ardent wishes for their union as the cause of her amiable distress was yet too recent and many months might possibly have passed away in the same irresolution if the receipt of the following letter had not precipitated this point to a more immediate crisis  to mademoiselle de beaumont aix la chapelle neve was amazement equal to mine at perusing your last letter what you wretch as you are raised by my hand and supported by my bounty presume to dictate to me in the disposal of my child and who is this lord seymour he is not an heretic if so that is sufficient objection were he a prince  but surely madam since you take upon you to inform us of intended marriages and act as plenipotentiary between our daughter and ourselves you should have informed us of the duke of b  s proposal and no more have dared to refuse than accept a lover for charlotte beaumont  the young duke himself has informed me of his simple attachment to the silly girl and of the insolence with which his proposal was rejected he inquired whether she was of our family i did as i ever shall disclaim her  the general who has been ill of a fever by me commands you on receipt of this to set out with charlotte beaumont instantly for paris he has devoted her to heaven and found out a fit retreat for that purpose in the convent of st anthony be it your business as it is your duty to teach her an implicit obedience to his will  she is now of age to be trusted with the secret of her birth but let her also know that when she relinquishes you as a mother she is not to expect to find one in  charlotte beaumont ps the general and i shall return to paris in a few days where we expect not to see but hear from you and charlotte  the moment you arrive at the hotel angloise you are commanded to send to the general but on no account attempt to come near our house     the situation of the unhappy charlottes mind upon reading this letter is not to be described who is this cruel woman she exclaimed that thus disclaims an unoffending child oh i will throw myself beneath her feet and soften that obdurate heart with tears my father too i have a father then sure he will raise me up in his parental arms and bless me they will relent and when they see my seymour and know his wondrous worth his wondrous love they will be charmed as their fond daughter is and give me to his wishes  full of these warm and natural apprehensions the halfdistracted charlotte flew to the cabinet which like pandoras box contained a thousand ills and with a trembling hand unlocked it the first objects that presented themselves to her view were miniature portraits of her father and mother  she gazed with joy and wonder never had she beheld such striking beauty of both kinds the manly and the mild  she kissed embraced wept over them nay knelt to them implored their pity and protection and in one moment was inspired with more respect and tenderness for those inanimate figures than she had ever felt for her supposed mother though gratitude and esteeem had answered all her purposes of filial affection in her gentle nature  she now sat down to search the book of fate those fatal sybils leaves that told her doom and while she read felt every passion that the human heart is capable of  yet still her love and reverence for her parents remained predominant and she determined to sacrifice herself to their unnatural commands and pass her days in a cloister if she could not prevail on them to change their cruel purpose  she quickly saw how improper it would have been to acquaint lord seymour with her real situation as he would doubtless oppose her returning to france with all the eloquence of love  yet to quit him without making any excuse or to descend to invent a false one were equally repugnant to her tender and generous nature  she had been bred in the roman catholic faith but had never conversed with bigots nor once thought that marrying the man she loved could be deemed a crime against any religion the idea first shocked her on her mothers pronouncing him a heretic and she resolved to make the difference of opinions a pretext for postponing their marriage till she could prevail upon her parents to give their consent which she vainly hoped she should be able to obtain from their tenderness and his uncommon merits  they know the power of love said she and will not like vulgar and unfeeling minds attempt to oppose his uncontrollable decrees  they will regard lord seymour for their charlottes sake and his tenderness for me shall appear by that love and duty that he shows to them  thus did the unhappy visionary fair one amuse herself till lord seymour came to pay his daily visit he had been used for some time past to see her melancholy and at times disturbed but as soon as he then saw her he perceived that her whole frame had been uncommonly agitated and when he tenderly entreated to know the cause she answered only with a flood of tears and begged he would not press her on the subject  though his fond heart was alarmed by a thousand different fears he chose rather to bear that cruel state of suspense than distress the object he adored and immediately desisted from any further inquiries when he left her that evening he felt an unusual degree of anxiety and was several times tempted to return and beg to know the source of her distress but he feared to offend by disobeying her commands and hoped at their next meeting her chagrin might be dispelled  lord seymour was to go out of town for a few days to the nuptials of a near relation and his loved charlotte had bid him adieu with a more than usual tenderness charlotte resolved to lay hold on the opportunity of lord seymours absence to set out for france she had found in the late madame de beaumonts cabinet about two hundred pounds in bills and money out of this sum she discharged all her servants except her own maid whom she determined to take with her she ordered one of those she parted with to remain in the house till lord seymours return in order to deliver him a letter which she should leave for him  she had now she thought settled matters in such a way that nothing remained to obstruct her purposed journey  but alas the more difficult part of her arduous task was yet to come  she was now to bid adieu to the man her soul adored she knew not what passion was till the severity of her fate compelled her to wish to conquer it a thousand times she attempted to write to him who was now dearer than ever to her but could not find words that were capable of expressing her complicated feelings  two sleepless nights and miserable days thus passed she dreaded lord seymours return and on the third while the chaise waited to carry her off she wrote the following lines  to lord seymour with a heart and eyes overflowing with the sincerest tenderness at the sad thought of being separated from the only man i ever did or ever shall love i find myself incapable of taking even a transient leave of him oh may it prove so  my flight must appear extraordinary to you why am i not at liberty to explain my motives but be assured they are such as your honor and virtue would approve though your fondness might oppose the effect i fly then my dear lord seymour to render myself worthy of you to ease my heart of some scruples which only can prevent its being wholly yours  if heaven smiles upon my purpose you shall hear quickly from me and surely innocence and love so pure as mine may claim its care but should it for wise purposes unknown to me blast all my flattering hopes of happiness and doom me to the lowest wretchedness thy image still shall dwell within my heart and shield it from dishonor  i would say more but cannot the chaise waits to carry me  from whom from thee what agonies are in that thought naught but the hope of meeting soon again could now enable me to say  adieu charlotte beaumont   as soon as she had sealed her letter she flung herself into the chaise and pursued her journey which she performed without meeting with any uncommon accident  in a few hours after she set out her brother who had been near two years absent returned to london his bravery had raised him to the rank of captain and as the war was then over he had obtained leave to visit his friends in england  he had not heard of mademoiselle de beaumonts death till he came to her house and was at once informed of that and charlottes abrupt departure the amiable young man was extremely shocked and grieved and in the midst of his tears for mademoiselle de beaumont lamented the uncertainty of his loved sisters fate and determined as soon as it was possible to pursue her steps to paris  just as he was quitting the house his eyes swollen with tears and his aspect impressed with the deepest sorrow lord seymour came to the door  young beaumont issued out regardless of a man he had never seen before and lord seymour though at first surprised at his appearance upon receiving charlottes letter thought of him no more  indeed all traces of recollection seemed to have been instantly erased from his memory and he remained like a man suddenly transfixed by lightning it was some time before he had power to ask when she set out or whither she was gone and when the servant replied to his queries he continued to repeat them without receiving the information he so earnestly desired  he read her letter a thousand times yet would neither credit that nor the servants affirmation that she had left the house  he ran distractedly through every room calling on his dear charlottes name and crying out it is impossible she must be here o do not kill me for thy sport my love but when he found his search was in vain he retired to his house in a state very little short of distraction  the moment our fair fugitive landed at calais she wrote a letter to each of her parents filled with expressions of the humblest duty and tenderest affection she acquainted them with the death of her supposed mother and mentioned her obligations to her with the highest gratitude and esteem she implored their permission to throw herself at their feet and that they would allow her a happiness she had been so long deprived of that of receiving a parents blessing  in vain was her tender and virtuous mind enriched with every noble and generous sentiment that could do honor to humanity her cruel parents were literally in the state of the deaf adder they shut their ears and eyes to her perfections and refused to receive the highest pleasure that human nature is capable of that of beholding an amiable and accomplished child  as soon as she arrived at the hotel angloise she found a servant waiting with a letter for her which contained these words  charlotte beaumont you are commanded to accompany the bearer of this who will conduct you to an apartment that is provided for your reception this night tomorrow a carriage shall attend to convey you to the convent of st anthony  the general is too much indisposed to see you at present  when he is able he will call upon you there  an implicit obedience to our orders which particularly enjoin the strictest secrecy in regard to your connection with us can only prove the truth of those professions of duty which you have made  you are still to appear in the state of an orphan which can be no great difficulty to one who has so lately known that she has parents if you have brought a servant she must be dismissed tomorrow and sent back to england if you have occasion for money the bearer will supply you  adieu c de beaumont   upon reading this letter all the tender ideas of filial affection which had thronged about poor charlottes heart seemed to vanish and the poignant anguish she had felt at tearing herself from her fond and generous lover returned with double force  she however determined not to halt at beginning the race and turning to her conductor with the utmost mildness and resignation said she was ready to attend him and hoped when she was lodged for the night he would do her the favor to wait till she should write a few lines to madame de beaumont  he told her he was ordered not to bring back any letter or message and hoped she would not take his refusal ill as he durst not venture to disobey  the tears now forced their way into charlottes eyes she told the servant she would not be the cause of his disobedience on any account and that she was ready to follow him  he put her and her maid into a chariot and directed the coachman where he was to go when they alighted they were shown into a very elegant apartment and her conductor after inquiring whether she wanted money or any farther assistance from him being answered in the negative bowed and withdrew  as soon as he was gone the now miserable charlotte gave vent to all her sorrows she threw herself upon the ground and washed it with her tears her affectionate servant who had lived with her from her infancy without knowing the cause of her distress vainly endeavored to console her entreated her to return to england and talked of lord seymours love and constancy  her every word struck daggers to the unhappy charlottes heart  as soon as she was able to speak she told her  she must part with her the next day that she determined to go into a convent for some time and advised her to set out immediately for london the poor girl who truly loved her was almost distracted at seeing and hearing her mistress look and speak so and positively declared she would never leave her let her determination in life be what it would  charlotte peremptorily insisted on discharging her from her service but told her she would support her in paris while her money lasted and that she might sometimes see her at the convent this in some measure quieted the poor servants anxiety but charlottes unhappiness increased every hour  she went not to bed and the pearly drops remained on her fair cheek when the sun had exhaled those of the dew  she wrote a few lines to let lord seymour know that she was going into the convent of st anthony and in her distraction gave the letter to her made to deliver without reflecting that the faithful nannette had resolved not to quit paris till her mistresss fate was determined  in the morning she dressed herself and endeavored to assume an air of composure and tranquillity with a breaking heart about ten oclock the same person who had attended her the night before came in a coach accompanied by madame de beaumonts woman who presented her with the following letter  charlotte both the general and i are much pleased with the accounts we have received of your behavior any remonstrance against our commands would be at once presumptuous and vain continue therefore to deserve our favor by a silent and unlimited obedience  you are already informed that the general has devoted you to heaven  let not his will who has an absolute power over you appear severe a convent is the only place where true happiness is to be found  that you may meet it there sincerely wishes  c de beaumont ps you are expected to enter upon your noviciate immediately     charlotte received this cruel sentence with amazing fortitude to her perturbed and wretched state of mind the quieter asylum of a cloister appeared not undelightful and had not her passion for lord seymour revolted against the severity of her doom she might have been led like a lamb to the sacrifice without a sigh or groan  madame de beaumonts last letter seemed less farouche than her former one and this encouraged charlotte to hope that time and her obedience might possibly awaken the tender feelings of maternal love in her hitherto obdurate breast she inquired whether she might be permitted to return her thanks for madame de beaumonts favor in writing and was again answered in the negative  she took a most affectionate leave of her disconsolate maid who followed the coach at a distance and saw her enter those gates through which she was never to pass again  when they arrived at the convent madame de beaumonts woman presented charlotte to the abbess as a willing victim she was therefore received with every outward mark of esteem and the grossest flattery was lavished by the whole sisterhood on those charms which they vainly imagined an acceptable sacrifice to the great creator of them  deluded mortals  the heart alone is all that he requires nor do the tender charities of life the love of parents husband brethren children pollute the oblation but render it more pleasing in his sight who first ordained then sanctified these natural ties  charlotte showed not the least reluctance at entering on her prohibition  she knew that a year must elapse before she could be compelled to take the veil and still flattered herself that fate would dispose of her in another way before that time should expire she imagined that by a seeming acquiescence she might be able to lessen if not entirely remove any restraint they might otherwise have been imposed upon her  she made no doubt that lord seymours passion would prompt him to pursue her and she fully determined to acquaint him with every circumstance of her life if she should ever have an opportunity for this purpose she employed every leisure moment she was mistress of in framing a little history from the papers she had found in the cabinet with the additional circumstances that had happened from the time of her leaving london  as she scarce ever appeared in the parlour or at the grate the sisterhood beheld her as the paragon of sanctity and her edifying example was quoted as a pattern for all the young ladies in the convent the little task she had imposed on herself by amusing her mind kept up her spirits so that she seemed to have acquired a constant habit of cheerfulness  but when her work was finished and two monts had elapsed without hearing from her father mother or what was still more interesting her lover she fell into a lowness of spirits which terminated in a slow fever she now looked upon herself as abandoned by all the world and the cruel suspicion of lord seymours inconstancy perfectly reconciled her to the gloomy prospect of perpetual seclusion  her faithful servant continued to see her frequently and as often mingled her tears with those of her unhappy mistress as she was one day musing on the uncommon miseries of her fate her maid approached her with unusual cheerfulness and cried out o madam he is come  a transitory joy now sparkled in charlottes eyes and the soft bloom that had forsaken her cheek returned with added blushes where is he she replied and ah how could he stay so long did thou see him nannette and has he mourned my absence  at that instant one of the lay sisters came to inform charlotte that a gentleman desired to see her she flew to the grate but how was her surprise increased when instead of lord seymour she beheld her brother  if any thing could have abated her joy at seeing him it must have been the disappointment she felt at not meeting lord seymour but though her expectation had been highly raised with the pleasing hope of such an interview she was sincerely rejoice at the unexpected sight of her much beloved brother  he immediately began to expostulate with her on quitting england and earnestly entreated her to leave the convent and put herself under his protection she told him that was not at present in her power as she was then in her noviciate but promised not to take the veil without his approbation which she was certain would follow every action of her life when he was acquainted with the motives and in order to explain both her situation and his own she would send him some papers to peruse which were of the utmost consequence to them both  captain beaumont was astonished at the mysterious manner which accompanied his sisters words but as he had the highest opinion of her honor and understanding he for the present suppressed his curiosity about the secrets she hinted at and retired to his lodgings to wait till nannette should bring an explanation of the mystery in which he found his innocent and unhappy sister involved  captain beaumont had left london the day after his sister and easily traced her through the progress of her journey but when he arrived at paris as he had no clue to guide him he wandered near three months in pursuit of her and but for the accidental meeting of nannette in the street he might have spent as many years in the same fruitless inquiry  lord seymour whose ardour and impatience to recover his lost fair one was ever more sanguine than a brothers could be was not so early in his pursuit the agitation of his mind upon receiving charlottes letter had thrown him into a violent fever and it was above three weeks before he was able to follow his fair fugitive  when he came to paris he was much at a loss to direct his inquiries as her brother had been  he had heard of her along the road and also of captain beaumonts following her and from the description he received of him had no doubt of his being the same person he had seen at her house the day she left it  love and jealousy are twins and it is impossible to defend the heart from one if you admit the other it was apparent to him that this person and charlotte were connected and his never having seen or heard of him increased his apprehensions of his being a favorite lover yet why if that were the case should charlotte continue to deceive him why write such a tender and affectionate adieu he knew not unless it were to lull his fears to sleep and prevent his endangering her lovers safety thus did the unhappy seymour increase his own calamities and drag about a wretched lifeless form to every public place in paris in the fond hope of meeting those transcendant charms that were now buried in a cloister  the sight of her brother had raised poor charlottes spirits by reviving her hopes of getting out of the convent yet of what use would she exclaim is liberty without love seymour abandons me and the world itself is now become a solitude to me more gloomy even than this cell but grant his love and constancy should still subsist and that he is this moment as wretched as myself could he receive into his family the natural and rejected daughter of such cruel parents no there is no resource for me on earth these walls for ever must confine this hapless frame my heart alone is free and flies of course to him  as soon as she had leisure she enclosed mademoiselle de beaumonts papers her father and mothers pictures with a letter from herself to her brother acquainting him with every thing that had passed since her arrival in france and entreating him not to mention the affinity between them at the convent lest it should give offense to their parents and occasion their being restrained from seeing each other for the future she earnestly implored his protection and assistance toward releasing her from the state she was in and promised to be guided by him in every action of her life  notwithstanding the inhuman treatment that charlotte had met with on perusing the papers captain beaumont was transported at finding himself so nearly related to the general  the pride of blood is inherent and the sanguine hope of preferment from such a high descent dazzled his reason he flew directly to his sister and told her with the precipitancy natural to a young man that he was rejoiced at the discovery and would go and throw himself at his fathers feet without having the least doubt of a favorable reception  in vain charlotte remonstrated against such an unadvised proceeding and mentioned to humility of her own conduct and the severity of her parents notwithstanding in order to deter him from making the experiment she feared that his approaching the general without any introduction would be construed into want of respect and that she should be condemned for informing him that he had a right to do so  but he was not to be restraned  she passed the night under the most gloomy apprehension yet would often say to herself what have i to fear can i be made more wretched let me then receive the only consolation that remains for misery like mine the knowing that any change must be for the better hapless maid a change will come that shall render your present state by sad comparison a scene of soft tranquillity and ease  the next evening on being informed that captain beaumont was in the parlour she flew to receive him and after asking a thousand questions with her eyes and tongue she laid her cheek close to the grate to listen to his answers at that instant she beheld lord seymour entering the room the agitation of her mind was now increased almost to distraction she knew not what she said or did and was utterly incapable of expressing the joy she felt at seeing the dear idol of her soul her brother appeared dejected and unhappy and the mistaken seymour attributed her confusion and his melancholy to motives which their souls were strangers to  we have already hinted that jealousy had infected his noble nature but seeing the object of it with the woman he adored added a thousand stings and he now felt in the supremest degree its poignant anguish his behavior to charlotte was constrained and cold he told her he was indebted to that gentleman pointing to her brother for the happiness of seeing her as he could not easily forget his having met him at her house the morning she left london he naturally supposed he could inform him where she was and having accidentally seen him just then enter the convent he had taken the liberty to inquire for her and hoped she would pardon his intrusion he added that he should leave paris in a few days and desired to know if she had any commands to england  though charlotte was astonished at his behavior she had however penetration enough to discover the cause and said she hoped she should be able to prevail on him to prolong his stay as she flattered herself with the thoughts of returning to england in a few months and should wish to have him her conductor  he bowed and replied he should think himself happy to be of any service to her provided he did not interfere with another persons right but as he believed that gentleman was her chief motive for visiting france he was doubtless entitled to the honor of attending her to england or wherever else she pleased  charlotte was rendered miserable by lord seymours suspicions yet as there was other company in the parlour she knew not how to obviate them as she was yet ignorant whether she might dare to own captain beaumont for her brother the latter was much surprised at lord seymours manner  he knew not of any connection between charlotte and him and thought her too condescending  the rest of the time they staid was passed in a constrained and difficult situation however charlotte found and seized an opportunity of speaking the words that are quoted in her letter to lord seymour already related before the gentleman withdrew  my dearest henry let not appearances disturb your mind i can and i will account for every action of my life to you  let your servant attend at the grate tomorrow for a letter from me and you shall be fully satisfied  though charlottes mind was perplexed with a thousand doubts and fears both for her brother and herself the transport of having seen lord seymour triumphed over them all and she once again enjoyed a transient gleam of happiness she knew it was in her power to remove all his suspicions she neither doubted his love nor honor and was certain he would assist her in getting out of the convent should they attempt to compel her to take the veil  after writing a few lines to lord seymour and making up her packet for him she lay down to rest with a heart more at ease than she had ever felt since the death of mademoiselle de beaumont but the bell had no sooner rung for mattins than she was presented with the following note  my dearest charlotte i die by lord seymours hand  some fatal mistake has caused this tragedy if he is your friend let him fly to preserve the only one you have now left my cruel parents will rejoice at my fate and i only lament it for your sake  adieu i fear for ever charles beaumont   nothing but the immediate loss of her senses could have preserved her life  she sunk motionless upon the ground and nature by being totally overpowered afforded some little respite to her distracted mind she remained in this situation till the nuns alarmed at her absence from the chapel came to seek her in her cell but when their cruel care had brought her so far back as to show some signs of life she could neither speak nor weep she appeared like grief personified she neither beat her bosom rent her hair or committed any act of outrage but continued almost immovable till a letter was brought her from madame de beaumont which contained these words  accursed be the hour that gave thee birth and doubly cursed the moment when thy pretended filial piety brought thee back to france to ruin and destroy the peace of them who had been blessed if thou had never been born why parricide and fratricide in one did thou inform the unhappy wretch who is now fallen a victim to thy vices of his affinity to us thy father never will surmount the shock which he received from seeing him and with his latest breath will curse thee for being the cause of his and thy brothers death  but thou i doubt not triumphest in thy wickedness and fondly hopest to wed the murderer of thy brother but here thy crimes shall end  thou shall immediately be conveyed to la salpetriere and made sensible of the unmerited kindness thou have hitherto received by the severities thou shall hereafter experience  c b   we might suppose that when the unhappy charlotte had read her brothers note her miseries could scarce admit addition but her inhuman mothers letter convinced her that the cup of sorrow though seemingly brimfull is always capable of increase  she was seized with inexpressible terrors at the thoughts of being sent to la salpetriere she was sensible the abbess and nuns where she then was treated her with the utmost kindness for as they looked upon her as a voluntary victim she had never experienced the least restraint but what the common rules of the house prescribed she had been accustomed to the tenderest treatment all her life and her present melancholy situation demanded it more than ever  after perusing the cruel anathema that doomed her to still greater miseries she flew into the abbesss apartment and prostrating herself before her with a flood of tears implored her pity and protection the good woman was moved at her distress and raising her from the ground assured her that no authority except the express order of the king should force her from that house and that if her enemies should attempt to procure a mandate by any false representation she would exert her utmost abilities to protect her  charlotte now considered the absolute impossibility of any future connection with lord seymour and therefore looked upon her continuance in the convent of st anthony as an asylum most devoutly to he wished for she thanked the abbess on her knees and would at that instant have taken the veil without repining if they could have abridged the time of her probation  she had now no longer any terms to keep with madame de beaumont and therefore mentioned the misfortunes her brother had met with and entreated the abbesss permission to send hourly to inquire his health her request was granted and she retired to her cell in some degree less wretched than she had left it  but when her tortured imagination represented her still dear lord seymour as the executioner of her brother her grief was without bounds yes she would say i am indeed accursed well does my mother style me so  yet are they cruel words to pass maternal lips oh had she but once blessed me i could not be the wretch i am  it is impossible to describe the various emotions of her distracted mind yet still love remained triumphant and she strove in vain to pursue what she thought the dictates of her duty the hating of lord seymour  captain beaumont continued to languish without hopes for near three months during which time she received the following letter from lord seymour  to mademoiselle de beaumont convinced as i am that i have given you cause to detest the name of him who now presumes to address you i would not madam intrude upon your sorrows but to offer you the only atonement which you can receive from such a wretch as me  i mean to inform you madam that i do not intend to fly from justice i knew the severity of the laws when i incurred their censure and the moment that precious life is ended which i have robbed you of i mean to offer up my own worthless as it is in order to expiate as far as is now possible the crime of having rendered you unhappy  but oh my dst charlotte may i not hope that when my blood has washed away my stains exhausted as the fountains of thy beauteous eyes may be with grief for my too happy rival thou then may spare one tear to the sad memory of the lost  seymour   there wanted but this last stroke to render charlotte the veriest wretch on earth she had flattered herself that lord seymour had quitted france immediately after the duel and that his life at least was safe and that at some time or other she should be able to convince him of his error and her innocence but now she beheld him wilfully devoting himself to the rack and suffering torture greater than even that can inflict from his mistaken opinion of her inconstancy  it was impossible that her delicate frame could longer support the complicated agonies that assailed her mind she fell into a raging fever during her delirium she raved incessantly of racks and gibbets of snatching seymour from them and suffering in his place at length however the natural goodness of her constitution and her blooming youth surmounted this dreadful disorder and her reason and wretchedness returned together  the first gleam of peace that broke through the horrors of her fate were some small hopes of her brothers recovery and in consequence of those hopes she by a solemn vow devoted herself to heaven if it should be pleased to spare his life but not all her religion and virtue could prev her as firmly resolving not to out  mour should he suffer   as soon  ter con  verance from death  seymour as far as possible by g himself for not avowing the relation between him and charlotte before their engagement but from a false punctilio he had thought it beneath an officer to use any argument in his defense except his sword and therefore by his manner had rather confirmed lord seymour in his error of supposing him his rival than undeceived him for which he begged both his lordships and his sisters pardon  he then gave her an account of the interview he had with his father and of the disgust and surprise which the general expressed at seeing him and that he had peremptorily commanded him to quit paris and join his regiment immediately and farther informed him that if he attempted to disobey he would have him broke with infamy  he said he had however reason to hope that the misfortunes he had met with had softened his fathers heart as he had been attended during his illness by the first surgeons in paris who came to his assistance unsent for and unpaid by him and that if his sufferings had made his father relent he should for ever bless the hand that had inflicted them  the pleasing hope of her brothers recovery was the most healing balm that could have been administered to charlottes wounded heart she no longer trembled for his life or what was dearer still lord seymours and she began in some measure to be reconciled to her fate merely by reflecting that it might have been more wretched  notwithstanding all her efforts now to conquer it her passion for lord seymour remained undiminished and she would have given worlds had she been mistress of them to undeceive him but though her faithful nannette had made the most diligent search for him from the time that captain beaumont was pronounced out of danger she could not discover his retreat  the time now approached for charlottes fulfilling the vow she had made to heaven by taking the veil the cruel madame de beaumont had made several fruitless efforts to prevail on the abbess to suffer her removal to another convent but as she feared to appear publicly in soliciting it lest the affinity between them should be revealed she at last contented herself with endeavoring to enforce the utmost strictness and severity which their rules would admit of with which the poor innocent sacrifice unreluctantly complied  as soon as captain beaumont was tolerably recovered he wrote again to his sister to inform her that he had received an order from his colonel to join his regiment immediately and at the same time a positive command from his father to leave paris without seeing her he conjured her in the strongest terms to renounce the veil and to fly to lord seymour for protection and told her he was certain that his lordship was still in paris as he had just then discovered that he was the person who appointed and paid the surgeons for their attendance on him  the fair disconsolate was now so enured to affliction that she bore this fresh mark of her parents inhumanity with gentleness and resignation but alas there was a woe superior far to all they could inflict and which like arons rod had swallowed up the rest lord seymour thought her guilty still  she had preserved the packet she had made up for him on the evening of their last interview and on the day preceding that on which she was to make her vows she received the following lines from him  to mademoiselle de beaumont though i approach you now with less terror madam than when i last presumed to address you still does my beating heart and trembling hand avow your power and amply revenge your sufferings on the wretch who dared to offend you but since it has pleased heaven to repair the cruel injury i did you by restoring my rival to your prayers and wishes will not the gentle charlotte condescend to pardon and pity the unhappy man who once thought fatal delusion himself honored with her love  i fly from paris madam from the sad scene of all my sorrows but they alas will be companions of my flight yet let me take one blessing with me a last if not a kind adieu from you  as you talked of returning to england i never will revisit it  the sight of the detested seymour no more shall shock your eyes or damp your joys  but let me wander where i will the warmest effusions of this still doting heart shall to its latest throb be poured forth in blessings on ah i had like to have said my angel charlotte my hand refuses longer to obey its wretched master and i can hardly say  adieu seymour   afflicted as the tender heart of charlotte was at her loved seymours deep distress she felt a momentary joy at the thought of being able to recover his esteem by proving herself worthy of his love she instantly sat down and with inexpressible anguish wrote the letter which has been already related and enclosed it with the narrative she had before written of her life to lord seymour  this dreadful conflict past she felt a dawn of peace beam on her mind and immediately gave orders that no letter or message should be brought to her she passed the night in fervent prayer and at the break of day summoned her young companions in the convent to adorn her for the sacrifice with all the dignified composure with which a queen puts on her regal robes  her conduct during the awful ceremony has been already described by lord seymour and sure a heart more truly virtuous or a form more exquisitely fair were never offered up at any shrine and may that gracious power to whom they are devoted bless all her future days with that sweet peace which goodness bosoms ever      letter xxiv lady straffon to lady woodville that my dear emily may not again reproach me for attending equally to foreign and domestic affairs i shall answer her two last letters before i speak my sentiments of the truly amiable and unhappy charlotte beaumont and first of the first  though you have desired me not to reply to it i find the subject so very interesting and alarming that i cannot in justice to you or myself comply with your request   you certainly must have lived some days upon essence of tea and reduced your nerves to the lowest state imaginable before your mind could be affected by the circumstances you mention not that i would insinuate that lord woodvilles sudden confusion was not the effect of a quick recollection or consciousness of some former scene which he perhaps might wish to have forgot in all probability it arose from the remembrance of some disastrous love adventure which obtruded itself involuntarily upon his mind  this point which you have barely hinted at i shall take for granted and then endeavor to show you the absurdity of being alarmed on such an occasion lord woodville is now in his eightandtwentieth year and has lived both in foreign courts and at home as much in the gay world as any man in england  and can my dear emily really suppose that she was the first object of his love  impossible it is much more reasonable to imagine that he had felt that passion half a dozen times at least before she was out of her hanging sleeves  but all girls flatter themselves with the entire possession of an husbands heart which if he happens as in your case to be seven or eight years older than her is no more in his power to bestow than youth or beauty but if he generously grants you all that remains at that time in his gift you have not the least right to complain and this i firmly believe lord woodville has done beware then my emily of appearing ungrateful for this present nor let him ever see that you do not consider even the remnant of his heart as a full equivalent for all your own this i must confess to be a very unequal lot of affections but the conditions of life should be acquiesced in without too much refining   there never was an higher instance of delicacy than lord woodvilles behavior to you in consequence of the temple adventure but do not give him too frequent opportunities of exerting his gallantry  you are a musical lady and know that a string may be strained till it breaks i am perfectly acquainted with the tenderness and sensibility of your nature but you are not to judge of others by your own fine feelings or think your husband deficient in affection if he is not so minutely attentive to trifling circumstances as your delicacy may prompt you to expect  les petits soins belong most properly to female life the great cares of the world are load sufficient for the ablest man i have now done chiding i hope for ever as i never can he angry with my emily but when she wounds herself  the description of your rural entertainment pleased me much  whenever i go to woodfort you shall take me to see your pocket arcadia  no upon second thoughts the scene would he incomplete without a swain i therefore desire you will present my compliments to sir james thornton and tell him that i appoint him my cecisbeo for that party if we should ever happen to meet at your house  i am not at all sorry that lord seymour has left you  the constant anguish which he must ever feel was sufficient to infect you all this naturally leads me to the charming nun i cannot forgive your want of ingenuousness in not mentioning the million of tears her story must have cost you  there never was any thing more affecting  lucy and i read and wept by turns  when one of us began to faulter the other endeavored to relieve her but there were many passages that neither of us could repeat aloud and only gazed silently on through the dim medium of our tears  it really requires a perfect certainty of the facts to suppose there ever were such monsters in nature as the general and madame de beaumont but charlottes unhappy fate is but too strong a voucher of their inhumanity yet miserable as the lovely vestal is i think lord seymour much more wretched  time devotion and a thorough consciousness of the rectitude of all her actions may calm her sorrows whilst his must for ever be aggravated by knowing that he has rendered her unhappy i think him truly to be pitied adieu my emily  loves and good wishes from all here accompany this to woodfort  f straffon  letter xxv lady woodville to lady straffon i have at present a house full of company and therefore must content myself with barely acknowledging the receipt of my dear fannys friendly admonitions which i frankly admit to be just though i feel they are severe call me no more a spoiled child when i so readily embrace the rod  lady lawson has been here these three days there have been odd reports about sir william and the young lady i formerly mentioned to you who went to london a few days before him but i am persuaded they are false for on sir williams return last night lady lawson received him with the most genuine and unaffected delight that could be expressed in looks or words and i hear that miss fanning that is the ladys name is to return to lawsonhall in a few days the knight appeared a little embarrassed but that might be owing to the meeting his lady in so much company we were all assembled at tea and knew nothing of his return  you must not expect me to be a constant correspondent from york the fatigue of dressing twice nay perhaps thrice a day will afford me but little time for more rational entertainment there are no moments which i think so totally lost as those spent at the toilette but the customs of whatever place we are in must be complied with your emily has not resolution sufficient to stem a torrent and must therefore always be carried away with the stream i will however keep a sort of journal of the occurrences of each day and you must accept of that in lieu of my letters  my reason for not avowing how much i was affected by the story of the nun was to avoid taking off that surprise which gives strength to every emotion  when we are told that a tragedy is extremely tragical we summon our resolution to oppose the feelings of our hearts and frequently suffer our pride to conquer its most graceful weakness whereas when we are taken by surprise we give nature fair play and do not attempt to combat with our humanity  adieu my dear fanny woodfort sincerely repays all the loves and good wishes of straffonhill  e woodville  letter xxvi lady straffon to lady woodville i ought perhaps to be more thankful to my dear emily for her last short letter than for any other she has written to me there is certainly the highest degree of merit in giving pleasure to others when the effort is attended with trouble or difficulty to ourselves the bestowing a quarter of an hour upon an absent friend while we are surrounded with the cheerful gaiety of present ones should always be considered as an high compliment  you may see by this remark that i set a proper value upon your kind attention but i am still more charmed with your condescension in admitting the justness of my arguments believe me my dear if we wish to be happy we must make it a constant rule to turn awy our eyes even from the minutest failings of those we love the suffering our thoughts to dwell long upon them must insensibly lessen our affection and of course our felicity  there cannot in my mind be a more pitiable object than a virtuous woman who ceases to love her husband  what a dreadful vacuity must she feel in her heart how coldly and insipidly must her life pass away who is merely actuated by duty unanimated by love  where there never has been passion there may for aught i know be a kind of mixed sensation compounded of esteem and mutual interest that supplies the place of affection to the insensible part of mankind  if this were not the case the generality of married people could not live so well together as they do  but this wretched substitute will never answer to a man or woman who has once truly loved  i would therefore most earnestly recommend it to all those who are so happy as to be united to the object of their choice to set the merits and attractions of each other in the fairest point of view to themselves and never even for a moment to cast their eyes on the wrong side of the tapestry  your account of the kindness with which lady lawson received her wandering swain very fully proves that she is an excellent wife but is by no means a refutation of the reports relative to him and miss fanning your ignorance of the world and its ways make such scenes appear extraordinary to you  but alas they are too frequent to be wondered at in such times as these  i shall not my dear emily insist upon your writing from york if it is inconvenient to you but as fanny weston tells lucy that you do not set out from woodfort this fortnight every day of which i dare say she thinks a year i may flatter myself with the hopes of hearing from you perhaps more than once before you go  that surprise increases our emotions i readily admit but as you had no reason to doubt the tenderness of lucys nature or mine you might have communicated your own sensations without fear of abating ours  sir john is gone to london for a short time and lucy and i are to spend the days of his absence not in retirement as you might possibly suppose but in discharging a heavy debt of visits which we owe to all the neighborhood for five miles round i think there are few small evils that torture us so much as what is generally called a good neighborhood in the country  adieu my dear emily i feel myself peevish at the idea of squandering my time with persons that i have not the least wish to converse with and asking simple questions without the smallest desire to be informed but as the world is constituted we must compound for spending some part of our lives disagreeably and endeavor to make ourselves what amends we can by enjoying that portion of it which is left to our own disposal  health and her fair handmaid cheerfulness attend my dear emily  f straffon  letter xxvii lady woodville to lady straffon my dear fanny is extremely kind in seeming to set so high a value upon my small or rather no merit in writing to her for indeed i can never claim any for what is to me the highest self indulgence  so a truce with your compliments my too civil sister  do not be angry fanny but i really cannot think with you that true affection should be founded on illusion which must be the case if we are to be totally blind to the failings of those we love  on the contrary i have always considered the raising our ideas of the persons we are to be united to too romantically high as one great source of matrimonial unhappiness by that means we became enamoured of a being which exists not in nature and feel ourselves mortified and displeased as at a real disappointment when we discover that our imagination has exceeded the bounds of possibility  but if absolute perfection were to be found on earth it would wound our selflove and whatever injures that can never be long dear to us in the imperfections of our most amiable friends we find a consolation for our own which forbids despair and places the generality of mankind pretty nearly upon a level this equally creates confidence and that naturally produces esteem and love  as these are my real sentiments i think i may venture to tell you that i am very sorry i have never been able to discover one failing in my lord i declare fanny this is a humiliating situation to a creature so conscious of a thousand weaknesses as i am instead of restraining me from searching for his faults i desire you will immediately provide me with a magnifying glass to assist me in the discovering them  what an horrid idea have you conjured up of a woman who ceases to love her husband there can be but two causes in nature that are capable of producing such an effect  for i talk not of those animals who never felt passion  the first of these must be a constant series of ill treatment which i suppose may at length conquer the tenderest affection and the unhappy sufferer who continues to act up to her duty under such circumstances deserves in my mind a much higher fame than any greek or roman that ever yet existed  the other cause must be owing to a shameful and vicious depravity of heart commonly called inconstancy which to the honor of our sex i think i may say is not frequent amongst us but when this happens to be the case there is generally some new object in view for that despicable wretch a woman of gallantry never changes her first love till she is engaged in a second  i thank heaven for my ignorance of the world and its ways as i hope and believe i shall never have any trial that may render a knowledge of them necessary i know not what to think with regard to lady lawson but for my own ease i will hope the best as it is impossible that i should be indifferent to any thing that distresses her  sir james thornton has had an ugly fall from his horse and strained his right arm but has not received any dangerous hurt though he is confined to his chamber lady harriet and fanny weston are indefatigable in their attendance on him i just now received a message from him to inquire my health which seems a kind of tacit reproach for not having been to visit him  my sister lawson and i spent all this morning in designing plans for a woodhouse  but as we are neither of us partial to our own inventions we have laid them by and determined to be rather good copyists than bad originals we have both agreed that it was possible to devise any thing more truly elegant than that on the terrace of taplow which is to be our model i have barely time to finish this to dress and look in upon thornton before dinner adieu my dear fanny i may hear from you again before we set out for york  yours ever e woodville  letter xxviii lady straffon to lady woodville my dear emily as i am perfectly convinced that in the account of our correspondence i am much your debtor on the article of the entertainment i am pleased at having a little adventure to relate to you though i cannot hope that the recital will afford you as much pleasure as the action gave me but you must make the same allowance as you do for a play in your closet and furnish out all the scenery decorations etc from the storehouse of your own imagination  my tale runs simply thus  as lucy and i were returning home last night from lady vaughans about eight oclock the sky quite dark and rainy one of the hind wheels of our carriage flew off but as we were traveling at a very slow pace in a miry road we received no hurt from the accident  we were about three miles from straffon hill which was rather too far for us to walk as we were by no means accoutred for peripatetics and just as ill qualified for an equestrian expedition we therefore sent off the postilion on one of the horses to bring the coach to us   we saw no friendly cottage near but at the distance of a quarter of a mile in the fields which seemed to us bright as the arcadian star or tyran cynosure one of the servants discovered a path that seemed to lead to the mansion from whence these charming beams had issued  we took him with us and setting forward soon reached the small but hospitable dwelling when we knocked at the door a little neat country girl appeared and after conducting us into a small parlour said she would acquaint her young lady that there were strangers there but that her mistress was at her devotions we announced ourselves to the girl and she retired  i was surprised at this young creatures mode of expression she seemed greatly amazed at our appearance but her astonishment could only be discovered by her looks in a few minutes an elegant young woman about eighteen entered the room and after saluting us very gracefully inquired to what happy accident she was indebted for the honor of our visit  the courtliness of her address and the ease of her manners were all new subjects of wonder both to lucy and me which we could not help expressing after we had informed her of the accident we had met with she very politely offered us tea or coffee  we declined both  but there was a mch higher treat in her power namely the gratification of our curiosity which we could not however venture to propose  when we had sat about a quarter of an hour the little servant came in and said her lady was come out of the chapel and would be glad to see us  we were immediately shown into a room the neatness and elegance of which it is impossible to describe at the upper end of it on a small sofa sat a woman with the finest form though pale and emaciated that can be imagined  she rose to receive us with such an affable dignity as at once attracted our respect and love she was dressed in black and appeared to be about five and thirty  though she spoke perfect good english there was just so much of the foreign accent in her utterance as must prevent your taking her for a native of this country  over the chimney of the chamber we sat in was a picture of a very handsome young man and at the other end of the room there hung one of the lady before us in all the bloom of beauty with her daughter then about four years old by her side and a boy that looked like a cherubim seated in her lap  as i gazed on every object round me with looks of admiration which the lady of the house could not help observing she turned to me with an engaging smile and said the surprise which your ladyship is too polite to express in words is so porfectly visible in your countenance that it would appear like affectation to seem insensible of it and as there is no part either of my past or present life that should cause a blush to grow upon my cheek i am ready to gratify that curiosity which the extraordinariness of my situation seems to have raised  it will probably be near an hour continued she before your carriage can arrive and a much less time will serve to relate the few though uncommon events that have placed me in the circumstances you now see me both lucy and i expressed our gratitude for such an obliging offer in the warmest terms and entreated she would proceed  without more ceremony she began  i am a native of italy and descended from one of the most ancient families of the republic of genoa  about twenty years ago i became acquainted with a young english nobleman called lord somerville whose picture you see there pointing her beautiful hand toward the chimney he was then upon his travels and under age  he became passionately in love with me and soon inspired me with more than gratitude with honest heart felt love  with my permission he applied to my father for his consent to our marriage well knowing that he could have no exception to his birth or fortune we had not the least apprehension of my fathers refusal  but we had both forgot that my lover was an heretic this was deemed by him so material an objection to our union that he declared he would confine me to a convent for life rather than hazard my salvation by such a marriage  my lover was forbidden to repeat his visits and i was sent about twenty leagues off into the country  lord somerville soon discovered my retreat and got access to me by the treachery or zeal of a servant who was entrusted with the care of me my father was informed of our interviews and determined to send me directly to a convent at naples where an aunt of my mothers was lady abbess a particular accident let me into the secret of my intended doom and i no longer hesitated to prefer love and liberty to cruelty and confinement after lord somerville had given me the most solemn assurances that i should preserve my religion inviolate we were married and set out privately in a felucca hired for the purpose which conveyed us both to marseilles  when we came to lions we were obliged to wait there for remittances from england before we could proceed farther after having long expected them in vain my lord received a very severe and angry letter from his father accusing him with having stolen the daughter of an italian nobleman and commanding him to restore me to my parents and return immediately to england  the distress of my husbands mind upon this occasion was not to be concealed but it was a long time before he acquainted me with the real motives of his concern fondly and passionately as i loved him i would have torn myself from his arms and gone into a convent till his fathers resentment might have been appeased if my condition would have permitted it  but i was then far gone with child of that young lady before you and he in the tenderest manner assured me that not even the commands of a father should have power to force him from me till he had the happiness of being himself a parent and of seeing me in a situation to support his absence or able to travel with him  we had lived in the utmost retirement and privacy from the time of our arrival at lyons  my lord had taken the name of fortescue and no creature except his banker knew who he was  we were so perfectly happy in each other that we wished for no other society  my lord amused himself with teaching me english  with such a tutor i soon became a considerable proficient and at the time that my laura was born i could read and perfectly understand the most difficult english authors  as soon as i was quite recovered we set out for paris where my lord purposed leaving me while he went over to england to pay his duty to his father and to endavour to reconcile him to our marriage i will not take up your time with attempting to describe our mutual sufferings at our separation such forms as yours must have feeling hearts and you can judge better than i describe what we endured  my lord remained above a year in england making repeated but fruitless efforts to conquer his fathers resentment against a person who had never in thought offended him but alas my being a catholic was as unpardonable a crime to him as my dear husbands being a protestant was to my father strange that the worshippers of one god and savior whose doctrine was peace and good will to men should feel such enmity and hatred to each other  at my lords return to france i could not help perceiving a visible change both in his health and spirits though his fondness for me was undiminished or if possible seemed to be increased by his tenderness for his daughter who was then near two years old as my lord concealed great part of his fathers unreasonable aversion to me i was not without hopes that time would conquer his prejudices which indeed i only wished upon my lords account for while i enjoyed the real happiness of his company there was not a desire of my heart ungratified  in less than a year that infant whose portrait you see there was born  from the time of his birth my lords health and spirits seemed to revive and i then certainly reached the zenith of human felicity alas how quickly did the wheel turn round to lay me in the lowest state of misery with what rapture have i seen him catch the infant in his arms and say this boy this boy my love will plead our cause with my obdurate father and soften his hard heart would he were three years old  but that blessed time will come and we shall all be happy   while lady somerville repeated the foregoing words her countenance became more animated than it is possible to describe but a sudden gush of tears soon dimmed the brilliant luster of her eyes and quenched the glowing crimson on her cheek she rose and opening a small folding door retired into the chapel  the young lady sympathized most sincerely with her mothers sorrow and lucy and i who were extremely affected were scarcely capable of making proper apologies for having been the innocent cause of renewing both the ladies afflictions miss somerville said every thing that politeness could dictate to make us easy and in a few minutes lady somerville returned with such an air of calmness and resignanation as amazed me  i took the liberty of entreating that she would not proceed farther in her story for the present but as i could not avoid being extremely anxious about every circumstance relative to so amiable a person i requested she would permit me to wait upon her the next day or when ever it was most agreeable to her inclination  she told me she was very sensible of the delicacy and propriety of my request which she readily assented to as it promised her the happiness of another interview with persons for whose sensibility and politeness she had conceived the highest respect said she was a little ashamed that her long acquaintance with grief had not yet rendered her so familiar with it as she might naturally be supposed to be but hoped we would excuse the sudden emotion which had for a few minutes transported her she then entreated our company to drink tea the next evening and said she would if possible be more composed  in about a quarter of an hour the coach arrived and we took leave of this charming unfortunate with the most earnest desire to renew our visit and the warmest hopes of being serviceable to her and her daughter  i am really fatigued with this long letter but i would not suffer oblivious sleep to steal any part of this axtraordinary adventure from my memory till i had communicated it to my dear emily by next post you shall have the remainder of the story till then and ever  i am affectionately yours f straffon  letter xxix lady straffon to lady woodville lucy and i set out immediately after dinner yesterday and reached lady somervilles elegant cottage before five oclock as we approached it by daylight we discovered many beauties that had been hidden from us by the dun shades of night particularly several small clumps of trees that were encircled with woodbines orange and lemon gourds and intermixed with a great variety of flowering shrubs  a small but neat garden at the bottom of which ran a rivulet so clear and sparkling as to appear like liquid diamonds  as we drove by the pales of the garden we perceived a building in it that seemed to be fitted up for a gardeners house and to our great astonishment beheld a man of a very respectable appearance about sixty years of age seated in an arbor with a book in his hand we were received by both the ladies with the same politeness and affability as the day before the folding doors which led to the chapel stood open and indeed emily there is no describing the elegance with which the alter is adorned  i am an enemy to all devotional parade yet i could not help considering the decorations of this sacred spot rather as the offerings of the heart to heaven than a sacrifice to vanity as all the ornaments that are placed there were the work of lady somervills and her daughters hands  as soon as tea and coffee were removed lady somerville without waiting to be entreated proceeded in her narrative thus  when i mentioned my having reach the pinnacle of human felicity i forgot to inform you that my father had been reconciled to me for some time and on the birth of my son had presented me with his picture set with diamonds and desired the portrait of my lord and those of my children  but before this request could be complied with i had the misfortune to lose my only parent  his death was sudden and he died without a will this was the first real affliction i had ever known and my lord in order to divert my melancholy proposed our going to the south of france  i acquiesced in his desire on his account more than my own for as his constitution was become extremely delicate i hoped the change of air might be of service to him we lived at mantauban for near two years during which time i had the constant anguish of beholding my dear husbands health decline daily  as he was perfectly sensible of his own situation he determined to take his little family to england and present his son to his unkind father every thing was fixed for our departure when providence to whose allwise decrees i bow myself beneath the dust thought proper to recall the treasure he had lent us and took my little cherubim to join the heavenly choir  no words can express the affliction of my loved lord nor describe the wretched state both of his mind and his body whole days he hung enamoured over the pale beauteous clay that was his child nor would he be prevailed upon to resign it to corruption till weakness left him not the power of opposition  from that time he sunk into a state nearly approaching to insensibility toward every thing except myself but to his latest moment his tenderness for me was undiminished why should i dwell longer upon a scene which but to think of now strains every nerve and makes the blood run backward to its source my misery was completed by his death in less than six weeks after that of my lovely boy   but i will stay my sorrows will forbid  my eyes to stream before thee and my heart  thus full of anguish will from sighs restrain  for why should thy humanity be grieved  with my distress and learn from me to mourn  the lot of nature doomed to care and pain you may suppose that lady somerville was for some time deprived of speech nor was there one of us capable of interrupting the melancholy silence but by our sighs she however soon dried her tears and resumed her discourse  i shall relate the rest of my story said she though totally uninteresting to myself as it will account for my present situation  i was about four months gone with child at the time of my lords illness and his last request to me was that i would if possible lyein in england and acquaint his father with my pregnancy as soon as i arrived there he told me that if the child i carried should be a son it would inherit the fortune and honors of his family but if not that there was no provision made for me or any daughters i might have as he was under age at the time he married and that the estate was intailed upon a very distant relation he implored me to preserve my life for the sake of the poor laura and to throw myself and her into his fathers protection  as it is utterly impossible that i should give you an adequate idea of my situation at that time i will not attempt it but endeavor to cast a veil over that scene of distress which no pen no pencil can ever be able to describe  i set out from montauban with my maid my chaplain and my child and arrived safe in london i obeyed my dear lords request and wrote immediately to his father his lordship was then in the country he answered my letter with great civility mixed with an affectation of kindness said he should be in town shortly that he would then see me and desired i would take care of myself for the sake of the unborn babe which he hoped would prove a son and heir  in a few days after i had received this letter i was informed that there were persons appointed to attend me till i was brought to bed lest i should impose a surreptitious child upon the family i knew not that such proceedings were usual in my case and i wrote a letter to my fatherinlaw complaining of such treatment to which he never deigned a reply  but all their apprehensions on my account were soon over i was delivered in the seventh month of a dead son and from that time i heard nothing farther from my lords father or any of his family for above six months the little money i had brought with me into egland was now quite exhausted and i was obliged to apply heaven knows how unwillingly to this inhuman parent for some means of support for his sons widow and grandchild  in his reply to my letter he told me what i knew before that neither my daughter nor i were entitled to any thing by law that therefore he advised me to go back to my own country and he would furnish me with money to carry me there provided i would leave laura in england to his care that if i should refuse these terms i must even provide for myself as it was not his purpose to offer me any others  when the mind has been once totally subdued by sorrow we flatter ourselves that we are incapable of being wounded by any new distress but the idea of being torn from the dear remains of my loved lord my only child convinced me that there were still some arrows in the quiver of adversity that had not yet been pointed at my peace  i did not hesitate one moment to determine that no consideration should make me consent to a separation from all that was now dear to me on earth i must indeed have been absolutely void of humanity as himself if i could have resigned my child into the hands of a man who had never even desired to see her before  i wrote immediately to my brothers at genoa and acquainted them with my distress they very kindly assured me that they would receive me and my daughter with open arms at our return but if it should be my choice to remain in england they would take care that i should not want a support there they immediately remitted me bills for a thousand piasters and agreed to settle the same sum annually upon me or more if i should have occasion for it  at this instance of generosity and affection my heart once more became expanded with gratitude to the almighty and with true sisterly tenderness to my benefactors i now began to make the first efforts toward subduing the violence of my grief and to be sensible that i might have been rendered still more wretched than i was by the deprivation of my child or our being reduced to slavery for bread  i soon fixed upon the plan of life which i meant to pursue and sent my worthy chaplain and my faithful maid in search of a retirement such as you now see in this spot i have lived about eight years in which time i have had no manner of converse with any human creature but my own family which now consists of my daughter my chaplain and myself my gardener his wife and the little maid their daughter whom your ladyship has seen  the only additional misfortune i have known in this place was the loss of my faithful maria she died about two years since and as my daughter was then of age not to need her attendance i have never attempted to supply her place  rusticated so long as we have been you will not i hope ladies be surprised at the simplicity of mine or my daughters manners  our situation is certainly a very extraordinary one and must naturally have raised your curiosity which i have endeavored to gratify by a plain and artless narrative  i wish for your sakes as well as my own that my story had been less affecting but i shall not make any apology for having drawn forth the lovely drop of sympathetic sorrow which glowed with brighter luster on your cheeks than the most costly brilliant  both lucy and i poured forth our thanks for her kindness and condescension in relating her story admired the constancy of her resolution in remaining so long in retirement but seemed to hope that she might change her purpose i saw she was displeased at such a hint but with great politeness said it was the only subject she did not wish to hear us talk upon as it would always give her pain to dissent from our opinion which she must ever do both in word and deed upon that subject  i then ventured to ask her if she wished that miss somerville should pass her life in such a state of seclusion she said by no means  so far from it that she sent forth a thousand fruitless wishes that some lucky accident might happen to introduce her to persons of sense and virtue and of a proper rank to lead her gently into life that she had heard the characters of all the persons of fashion in that neighborhood from her chaplain who frequently mixed with the world in order to transact her affairs  that as she was above flattery she was also superior to disguise and frankly owned that her utmost wish in this world would be gratified if lady straffon would promise her protection to her dear orphan  i scarce suffered her to finish the latter part of her speech before i flew to and embraced her and with great truth assured her that my inclinations met hers more than half way i begged that from that moment she would do me the honor to consider me as her sister and that the lovely laura might be henceforth deemed my niece  every thing that delicate gratitude could dictate was uttered upon this occasion and we all appeared to be infinitely happier than we could have supposed it possible for us to be in so short a time after having been so very much afflicted  lady somerville concluded with informing me that her fatherinlaw had been dead about fouryears and had left miss somerville sixthousand pounds we agreed that lucy should bring laura to straffonhill tomorrow and i promised to convey her back to her ladyship whenever she required her attendance  you cannot my dear emily yes you can conceive the sincere pleasure i feel at having it in my power to oblige the amiable and unfortunate lady somerville it must certainly be an infinite relief to her mind to know that her daughter has a friend and protector in case providence should be pleased to put a period to her woes and take her to his mercy but she must necessarily suffer a great deal in being separated from her till use shall have made it easy  laura is but just seventeen though she looks rather older from the gravity and dignity of her appearance i flatter myself you will receive some entertainment from this narrative which i have been as exact in as my memory would permit and indeed it has for the time so entirely engrossed my attention that i am pretty sure i have not omitted a circumstance of any consequence  i expect sir john will return from london the beginning of next week  i hope he will be charmed with our young visitor and that lady somerville will suffer him sometimes to spend an hour with her  adieu my dear emily i am as usual affectionately yours f straffon  letter xxx lady woodville to lady straffon i most sincerely congratulate my dear fanny upon the acquisition she has made to her happiness by her acquaintance with lady somerville there was something extremely romantic in the opening of your adventure and i almost began to imagine that you had taken a trip to fairy land but every circumstance though surprising at first is very naturally accounted for in the course of your narrative i truly compassionate the unhappy ladys situation and again felicitate you on having it in your power to remove a very material part of her distress by affording your friendship and protection to her daughter  lady somervilles misfortunes are of the hopeless kind it is not in the power of fate to restore her husband or her son and slight observers would for these reasons pronounce her much more wretched than those who are led on by a faint glimpse of hope to wander through the thorny paths of life in search of some imaginary bliss which still cludes their grasp but i think otherwise when the grave closes on our joys our prospect of this world must all end there we can no more deceive ourselves or be deceived we sink it is true and fall with the dear prop which fate has torn away then reason and religion come to our aid and when the first wild stats of grief are over an humble acquiescence in the divine will sooths our sad souls to peace or hopes spring forward to another goal and pierce beyond the stars  but while vain doubts and fears torment the heart while passion has possession of the soul and still impels us forward through amaze where our bewildered reason finds no clue where peace is lost and keen disquiet fills its vacant place where our desires are raised but to be mocked and cruelty repaid for artless love  sure sure this state is worse far worse than lady somervilles she feels the stroke of death but lady harriet feels a living torture inflicted too by whom her soul adored  i have been led into this reflection by observing that lady harriets health and spirits have declined visibly ever since her unlucky interview with captain barnard and i am certain that his almost perpetual residence at ransfordhall increases her disquiet in his first act of inconstancy she might with great reason imagine that fortune only had turned the scale in favor of her rival and she had still the melancholy consolation of supposing herself beloved though by a worthless man  his present attachment can arise only from choice or galantry and it is certainly much more difficult to bear contempt than injury had he died at that time he left her in paris her grief for his loss would by this time have been softened into a gentle melancholy which though it might for ever have barred her pretensions to happiness would not have rendered her half so wretched as she is at this moment and i fear will ever be  let not what i have said upon this subject make my dear fanny think that i am not extremely affected with lady somervilles distress  i acknowledge that her sufferings have been great but they certainly came to a period when her husband died and time has i doubt not insensibly lessened her affliction i also hope that there is yet in reserve for her the felicity of seeing her daughter amiable and happy  adieu my dear fanny my lord and all this family salute you and yours most affectionately i desire you will present my respects to lady somerville and her daughter both of whom i hope to have the pleasure of seeing when next i am so happy as to visit straffonhill  yours ever e woodville  letter xxxi from lady straffon to lady woodville my dear emily i am so sincerely charmed at the hope of your prophecy in favor of lady somerville being immediately accomplished that i can neither think speak or write upon any other subject  sir john returned from london in two days after laura had become our guest she and i were just come back from paying an evening visit to lady somerville when he entered the drawing room and introduced a young italian nobleman who had been recommended to him by one of his most intimate friends at paris  i never beheld a handsomer youth tall graceful and finely made with the strongest expression of sense and sweetness in his countenance  as he cannot speak english our conversation was entirely italian in which though lucy and i are tolerable proficients we were greatly excelled by miss somerville who has had the advantage of conversing with her mother in that charming language from her earliest infancy  the first two or three days that our young foreigner spent with us we imagined that his devoting the largest share of his time and conversation to laura was owing to the easy fluency with which she spoke his native language but his motives remained not long doubtful he became very particular in his inquiries about her to sir john who gave him the fullest information of her birth and situation in life he seemed charmed at the account of both and from that time his assiduity toward her appeared less embarrassed  nor is the gentle heart of laura insensible to his attentions her blushes when he is mentioned and down cast looks when he addresses her plainly discover the state of her artless mind she is really a very fine creature emily and i am truly anxious for her happiness she has a sensibility a frankness a delicate ingenousness of nature not to be found in those who have had much commerce with the world which she owes to her sequestered education with a parent whose natural softness has been increased by a long acquaintance with affliction  but to the purpose  last night the enamoured lodovico explained his sentiments to sir john and entreated him to prevail on me to introduce him to lady somerville though he confessed that he found laura extremely averse to a proposal which must for ever divide her from the tenderest of mothers but as she seemed to have no other objection he flattered himself that this might be surmounted  sir johns friend lord mount willis who recommended lodovico to him informed him that he is descended from one of the first families at genoa that he is an only son entitled to a very large fortune and still possessed of a much higher treasure  an unexceptionable character  i needed not much persuasion to enter upon such a pleasing embassy  i waited on lady somerville this morning she seemed a little alarmed at lauras not being with me i quickly removed her apprehensions by explaining the cause of my visit she heard me with the utmost attention but could not help dropping some tears when i mentioned lauras objection to quitting her  lady straffon said she when i had finished my discourss though my girls affection awakens all my tenderness for her i will not suffer her to sacrifice her welfare to my selfish satisfaction  the world contains but one object for me let her be happy and contribute to the happiness of a deserving husband and i shall taste the only joy my heart is capable of and should that long absent guest ever deign to visit me again it is to you the blessed minister of providence to whom i am indebted for its presence  i endeavored to restrain the grateful effusions of her generous heart by assuring her that i felt almost as much pleasure as even she could be sensible of from the prospect of lauras future happiness  we then agreed that i should bring laura and lodovico to wait upon her in the afternoon  the instant i return i will acquaint you with the result of our visit till then  adieu f straffon  letter xxxii lady straffon to lady woodville in continuation  join with me my dearest emily in rejoicing at the happiness which opens to the view of our amiable friends but i will not detain you from the events which create their present joy i carried my two young guests laura and lodovico this afternoon to lady somervilles cottage she received us with her usual grace and elegance but when i presented signior lodovico to her i fancied i perceived a change of countenance which i knew not how to account for however she presently recovered herself and continued to entertain us with the greatest politeness  after tea i took laura into the garden under pretense of admiring a little grotto she had lately finished in order to give the young gentleman an opportunity of explaining his sentiments to her mother we had not been ten minutes absent when the little country maid came running to us and desired we would return immediately  we were not a little surprised at this summons but judge how our wonder was increased on finding lady sommerville with her eyes streaming and lodovico seated by her with an air that spoke him a sharer in her emotions the moment we entered the room she started up and taking her daughters hand come said she come and embrace your cousin the son of that friend that more than brother to whom we have been indebted for the means of life so many years  poor laura was unable to speak but her eyes fully expressed the tender and grateful sentiments of her heart the enraptured lodovico seemed totally absorbed in the pleasure of gazing on her  after some time lady somerville turning to me said you see before you my dear lady straffon the only son of count melespini  the instant i saw him i was struck with the resemblance of that much loved brother  but how could i flatter myself with the happiness of beholding his son  and now my dear children continued she though my consent awaits ye be assured that without the courts concurrence this union never can take place write to him therefore lodovico and let both him and you rest satisfied that his will shall in this affair determine mine  in the mean time i hope said she your ladyship will dispense with lauras attendance at straffonhill perhaps my brother may have other views for his son if so it is best not to indulge an affection too far which may be productive of unhappy consequences for be assured that however deserving the object however virtuous the attachment no marriage can be truly blessed that pains a parents heart  a too energic sigh accompanied these words but added she when lady straffon honors me with her company i hope my nephew will attend her  it was very visible that lodovico complied reluctantly with these conditions and perhaps laura for the first time found obedience difficult  but as her ladyship seemed determined a bow of assent was the only reply that was made signior lodovico and i returned home soon after this conversation  by the way he accounted to me for not knowing that lady somerville or laura were related to him as he had always heard them call statevilla which is their name in italian i find he intends making as much use as possible of the privilege of attending me to lady somervilles so that i expect to pass much of my time at the cottage  he is now retired to acquaint his father with the happy discovery he has made of his relations and his sentiments toward his fair cousin i shall be truly impatient for the counts answer  i hope it will be favorable if it should not i fear all lady somervilles precaution will be insufficient to prevent the attachments of the young people though i believe it would be impossible to draw laura from her obedience  i have been so much engaged in the affairs of the somerville family for these two days that i have scarce had leisure to think of my own  you may therefore excuse my not entering upon the critical distinctions you have made on the various modes of misery in your last letter i heartily wish you would take the opposite extreme for your subject and descant on your own happiness which i believe to be as perfect as this frail state will admit of may it long continue so sincerely wishes  your affectionate f straffon  end of the first volume
