over springs and rivulets are addressed at daybreak in honor of their several functions and of the relations which they bear to the natural and to the moral world their origin is deduced from the first allegorical deities or powers of nature according to the doctrine of the old mythological poets concerning the generation of the gods and the rise of things they are then successively considered as giving motion to the air and exciting summerbreezes as nourishing and beautifying the vegetable world as contributing to the fullness of navigable rivers and consequently to the maintenance of commerce and by that means to the maritime part of military power next is represented their favorable influence upon health when assisted by rural exercise which introduces their connection with the art of physic and the happy effects of mineral medicinal springs lastly they are celebrated for the friendship which the muses bear them and for the true inspiration which temperance only can receive in opposition to the enthusiasm of the more licentious poets  hymn to the naiads over yonder eastern hill the twilight throws her dusky mantle and the god of day with bright astraea seated by his side waits yet to leave the ocean tarry nymphs ye nymphs ye blueeyd progeny of thames who now the mazes of this rugged heath trace with your fleeting steps who all night long repeat amid the cool and tranquil air your lonely murmurs tarry and receive my offered lay to pay you homage due i leave the gates of sleep nor shall my lyre too far into the splendid hours of morn engage your audience my observant hand shall close the strain ere any sultry beam approach you to your subterranean haunts ye then may timely steal to pace with care the humid sands to loosen from the soil the bubbling sources to direct the rills to meet in wider channels or beneath some grottos dripping arch at height of noon to slumber sheltered from the burning heaven where shall my song begin ye nymphs or end wide is your praise and copious  first of things first of the lonely powers ere time arose were love  love   elder than chaos hesiod in his theogony gives a different account and makes chaos the eldest of beings though he assigns to love neither father nor superior which circumstance is particularly mentioned by phaedrus in platos banquet as being observable not only in hesiod but in all other writers both in verse and prose and on the same occasion he cites a line from parmenides in which love is expressly styled the eldest of all the gods yet aristophanes in the birds affirms that chaos and night and erebus and tartarus were first and that love was produced from an egg which the sablewinged night deposited in the immense bosom of erebus but it must be observed that the love designed by this comic poet was always distinguished from the other from that original and selfexistent being the  or  of plato and meant only the  or second person of the old grecian trinity to whom is inscribed an hymn among those which pass under the name of orpheus where he is called protogonos or the firstbegotten is said to have been born of an egg and is represented as the principal or origin of all these external appearances of nature in the fragments of orpheus collected by henry stephens he is named phanes the discoverer or discloser who unfolded the ideas of the supreme intelligence and exposed them to the perception of inferior beings in this visible frame of the world as macrobius and proclus and athenagoras all agree to interpret the several passages of orpheus which they have preserved  but the love designed in our text is the one selfexistent and infinite mind whom if the generality of ancient mythologists have not introduced or truly described in accounting for the production of the world and its appearances yet to a modern poet it can be no objection that he has ventured to differ from them in this particular though in other respects he professes to imitate their manner and conform to their opinions for in these great points of natural theology they differ no less remarkably among themselves and are perpetually confounding the philosophical relations of things with the traditionary circumstances of mythic history upon which very account calsimachus in his hymn to jupiter declares his dissent from them concerning even an article of the national creed adding that the ancient bards were by no means to be depended on and yet in the exordium of the old argonautic poem ascribed to orpheus it is said that love whom mortals in later times call phanes was the father of the eternally begotten night who is generally represented by these mythological poets as being herself the parent of all things and who in the indigitamenta or orphic hymns is said to be the same with cypris or love itself moreover in the body of this argonautic poem where the personated orpheus introduces himself singing to his lyre in reply to chiron he celebrateth the obscure memory of chaos and the natures which it contained within itself in a state of perpetual vicissitude how the heaven had its boundary determined the generation of the earth the depth of the ocean and also the sapient love the most ancient the selfsufficient with all the beings which he produced when he separated one thing from another which noble passage is more directly to aristotles purpose in the first book of his metaphysics than any of those which he has there quoted to show that the ancient poets and mythologists agreed with empedocles anaxagoras and the other more sober philosophers in that natural anticipation and common notion of mankind concerning the necessity of mind and reason to account for the connection motion and good order of the world for though neither this poem nor the hymns which pass under the same name are it should seem the work of the real orpheus yet beyond all question they are very ancient the hymns more particularly are allowed to be older than the invasion of greece by xerxes and were probably a felt of public and solemn forms of devotion as appears by a passage in one of them which demosthenes has almost literally cited in his first oration against aristogiton as the saying of orpheus the founder of their most holy mysteries on this account they are of higher authority than any other mythological work now extant the theogony of hesiod himself not excepted the poetry of them is often extremely noble and the mysterious air which prevails in them together with its delightful impression upon the mind cannot be better expressed than in that remarkable description with which they inspired the german edition eschenbach when he accidentally met with them at leipsic thesaurum me reperisse credidi says he and prosecto thesaurum reperi incredibile dictu quo me sacro horrore afflaverint indigitamenta ista deorum nam et tempus ad illorum lectionem eligere cogebar quod vel solum horrorem incutere animo potest nocturnum cum enim totam diem consumserim in contemplando urbis splendore and in adeundis quibus scatet urbs illa viris doctis sola nox restabat quam orpheo consecrare potui in abyssum quendam mysteriorum venerandae antiquitatis descendere videbar quotiescunque silente mundo solis vigilantibus astris et luna  istos hymnos ad manus sumsi   and chaos chaos the unformed undigested mass of moses and plato which milton calls  the womb of nature   love the sire of fate love the sire of fate fate is the universal system of natural causes the work of the omnipotent mind or of love so minudius felix quid aliud est fatum quam quod de unoquoque nostrum deus fatus est so also cicero in the first book on divination fatum autem id appello quod graeci eipmapmenhn id est ordinem seriemque causarum cum causa causae nexa rem ex se gignat  ex quo intelligitur ut fatum sit non id quod superstitiose sed id quod physice dicitur causa aeterna rerum to the same purpose is the doctrine of hierocles in that excellent fragment concerning providence and destiny as to the three fates or destinies of the poets they represented that part of the general system of natural causes which relates to man and to other mortal beings for so we are told in the hymn addressed to them among the orphic indigitamenta where they are called the daughters of night or love and contrary to the vulgar notion are distinguished by the epithet of gentle and tenderhearted according to hesiod theog ver  0  they were the daughers of jupiter and themis but in the orphic hymn to venus or love that goddess is directly styled the mother of necessity and is represented immediately after as governing the three destinies and conducting the whole system of natural causes  elder than chaos born of fate was time born of fate was time cronos saturn or time was according to apollodorus the son of coelum and tellus but the author of the hymns gives it quite undisguised by mythological language and calls him plainly the offspring of the earth and the starry heaven that is of fate as explained in the preceding note  who many sons who many sons devoured the known fable of saturn devouring his children was certainly meant to imply the dissolution of natural bodies which are produced and destroyed by time and many comely births devoured relentless father till the child of rhea the child of rea jupiter so called by pindar drow him from the upper sky drove him from the upper sky that jupiter dethroned his father saturn is recorded by all the mythologists phurnutus or cornutus the author of a little greek treatise on the nature of the gods informs us that by jupiter was meant the vegetable soul of the world which restrained and prevented those uncertain alterations which saturn or time used formerly to cause in the mundane system  and quelled his deadly might then social reigned then social reigned our mythology here supposes that before the establishment of the vital vegetative plastic nature represented by jupiter the four elements were in a variable and unsettled condition but afterward welldisposed and at peace among themselves tethys was the wife of the ocean ops or rhea the earth vesta the eldest daughter of saturn fire and the cloudcompeller or  the air though he also represented the plastic principle of nature as may be seen in the orphic hymn inscribed to him  the kindred powers tethys and reverend ops and spotless vesta while supreme of sway remained the cloudcompeller from the couch of tethys sprang the sedgycrowned race the sedgycrowned race the rivergods who according to hesiods theogony were the sons of oceanus and tethys  who from a thousand urns over every clime send tribute to their parent and from them are ye o naiads from them are ye o naiads the descent of the naiads is less certain than most points of the greek mythology homer odyss xiii  virgil in the eighth book of the aeneid speaks as if the nymphs or naiads were the parents of the rivers but in this he contradicts the testimony of hesiod and evidently departs from the orthodox system which represents several nymphs as retaining to every single river on the other hand calimachus who was very learned in all the school divinity of those times in his hymns to delos makes peneus the great thessalian rivergod the father of his nymphs and ovid in the fourteenth book of his metamorphoses mentions the naiads of latium as the immediate daughters of the neighboring river gods accordingly the naiads of particular rivers are occasionally both by ovid and statius called by a patronymic from the name of the river to which they belong  arethusa fair and tuneful aganippe that sweet name bandusia that soft family which dwelt with syrian daphne syrian daphne the grove of

seeks to dwell and over the lawns and over the vale of richmond where with thames ye love to wander amalthea amalthea the mother of the first bacchus whose birth and education was written as diodorus siculus informs us in the old pelasgic character by thymoetes grandson to laomedon and contemporary with orpheus thymoetes had traveled over libya to the country which borders on the western ocean there he saw the island of nysa and learned from the inhabitants that ammon king of lybia was married in former ages to rhea sister of saturn and the titans that he afterward fell in love with a beautiful virgin whose name was amalthea had by her a son and gave her posession of a neighboring tract of land wonderfully fertile which in shape nearly resembling the horn of an ox was thence called the hesperian horn and afterward the horn of amalthea that fearing the jealousy of rhea he concealed the young bacchus with his mother in the island of nysa the beauty of which diodorus describes with great dignity and pomp of style this fable is one of the noblest in all the ancient mythology and seems to have made a particular impression on the imagination of milton the only modern poet unless perhaps it be necessary to except spenser who in these mysterious traditions of the poetic story had a heart to feel and words to express the simple and solitary genius of antiquity to raise the idea of his paradise he prefers it even to  that nysean isle girt by the river triton where old cham whom gentiles ammon call and libyan jove hid amalthea and her florid son young bacchus from his stepdame

most remarkable example of that mythological passion which is assumed in the preceding poem and have always afforded particular pleasure to the author of it by reason of the mysterious solemnity with which they affect the mind on this account he was induced to attempt somewhat in the same manner solely by way of exercise the manner itself being now almost entirely abandoned in poetry and as the mere genealogy or the personal adventures of heathen gods could have been but little interesting to a modern reader it was therefore thought proper to select some convenient part of the history of nature and to employ these ancient divinities as it is probable they were first employed to wit in personifying natural causes and in representing the mutual agreement or opposition of the corporeal and moral powers of the world which has been accounted the very highest office of poetry shell behold i touch revering to my songs be present ye with favorable feet and all profaner audience far

great victories gained on the same day over the persians by sea and land diodorus siculus has preserved the inscription which the athenians affixed to the consecrated spoils after this great success

homers page exulting pindar pindar was contemporary with aristides and cymon in whom the glory of ancient greece was at his height when xerxes invaded greece pindar was true to the common interest of his country though his fellowcitizens the thebans had sold themselves to the persian king in one of his odes he expresses the great distress and anxiety of his mind occasioned by the vast preparations of xerxes against greece isthm   in another he celebrates the victories of salamis plata and himera pyth   it will be necessary to add two or three other particulars of his life real or fabulous in order to explain what follows in the next concerning him first then he was thought to be so great a favorite of apollo that the priests of that deity allotted him a constant share of their offerings it was said of him as of some other illustrious men that at his birth a swarm of bees lighted on his lips and fed him with their honey it was also a tradition concerning him that pan was heard to recite his poetry and seen dancing to one of his hymns on the mountains near thebes but a real historical fact in his life is that the thebans imposed a large fine upon him on account of the veneration which he expressed in his poems for that heroic spirit shown by the people of athens in defense of the common liberty which his own fellowcitizens had shamefully betrayed and as the argument of this ode implies that great poetical talents and high sentiments of liberty do reciprocally produce and assist each other so pindar is perhaps the most exemplary proof of this connection which occurs in history the thebans were remarkable in general for a slavish disposition through all the fortunes of their commonwealth at the time of its ruin by philip and even in its best state under the administration of pelopidas and epaminondas and every one knows they were no less remarkable for great dullness and want of all genius that pindar should have equally distinguished himself from the rest of his fellowcitizens in both these respects seems somewhat extraordinary and is scarce to be accounted for but by the preceding observation saw to full perfection brought o pindar often shall thou be hailed of me not that apollo fed thee from his shrine not that thy lips drank sweetness from the be nor yet that studious of thy notes divine pan danced their measure with the sylvan throng but that thy song was proud to unfold what thy base rulers trembled to behold amid corrupted thebes was proud to tell the deeds of athens and the persian shame hence on thy head their impious vengeance fell but thou o faithful to thy fame the muses law did rightly know that who would animate his lays and other minds to virtue raise must feel his own with all her spirit glow iii   are there approved of later times whose verse adorned a octavius caesar tyrants crimes who saw majestic rome betrayed and lent the imperial ruffian aid alas not one polluted bard no not the strains that mincius

produce such various thoughts or range them so for use can matter these contain dispose apply can in her cells such mighty treasures lie or can her native force produce them to the eye whence is this power this foundress of all arts serving adorning life through all its parts which names imposed by letters marked those names adjusted properly by legal claims from woods and wilds collected rude mankind and cities laws and governments designed what can this be but some bright ray from heaven some emanation from omniscience given when now the rapid stream of eloquence bears all before it passion reason sense can its dread thunder or its lightnings force derive their essence from a mortal source what think you of the bards enchanting art which whether he attempts to warm the heart with fabled scenes or charm the ear with rhyme breathes all pathetic lovely and sublime whilst things on earth roll round from age to age the same dull farce repeated on the stage the poet gives us a creation new more pleasing and more perfect than the true the mind who always to perfection hastes perfection such as here she never tastes with gratitude accepts the kind deceit and thence foresees a system more complete of those what think you who the circling race of suns and their revolving planets trace and comets journeying through unbounded space say can you doubt but that the allsearching soul that now can traverse heaven from pole to pole from thence descending visits but this earth and shall once more regain the regions of her birth could she thus act unless some power unknown from matter quite distinct and all her own supported and impelled her she approves selfconscious and condemns she hates and loves mourns and rejoices hopes and is afraid without the bodys unrequested aid her own internal strength her reason guides by this she now compares things now divides truths scattered fragments piece by piece collects rejoins and thence her edifice erects piles arts on arts effects to causes ties and rears the aspiring fabric to the skies from whence as on a distant plain below she sees from causes consequences flow and the whole chain distinctly comprehends which from the almightys throne to earth descends and lastly turning inwardly her eyes perceives how all her own ideas rise contemplates what she is and whence she came and almost comprehends her own amazing frame can mere machines be with such powers endued or conscious of those powers suppose they could for body is but a machine alone moved by external force and impulse not its own rate not the extension of the human mind by the plebeian standard of mankind but by the size of those gigantic few whom greece and rome still offer to our view or britain welldeserving equal praise parent of heroes too in better days why should i try her numerous sons to name by verse law eloquence consigned to fame or who have forced fair science into sight long lost in darkness and afraid of light over all superior like the solar ray first bacon ushered in the dawning day and drove the mists of sophistry away pervaded nature with amazing force following experience still throughout his course and finishing at length his destined way to newton he bequeathed the radiant lamp of day illustrious souls if any tender cares affect angelic breasts for mans affairs if in your present happy heavenly state youre not regardless quite of britains fate let this degenerate land again be blessed with that true vigor which she once possessed compel us to unfold our slumbering eyes and to our ancient dignity to rise such wondrous powers as these must sure be given for most important purposes by heaven who bids these stars as bright examples shine besprinkled thinly by the hand divine to form to virtue each degenerate time and point out to the soul its origin sublime that there is a self which after death shall live all are concerned about and all believe that somethings ours when we from life depart this all conceive all feel it at the heart the wise of learned antiquity proclaim this truth the public voice declares the same no land so rude but looks beyond the tomb for future prospects in a world to come hence without hopes to be in life repaid we plant slow oaks posterity to shade and hence vast pyramids aspiring high lift their proud heads aloft and time defy hence is our love or fame a love so strong we think no dangers great or labors long by which we hope our beings to extend and to remotest times in glory to descend for fame the wretch beneath the gallows lies disowning every crime for which he dies of life profuse tenacious of a name fearless of death and yet afraid of shame nature has wove into the human mind this anxious care for names we leave behind to extend our narrow views beyond the tomb and give an earnest of a life to come for if when dead we are but dust or clay why think of what posterity shall say her praise or censure cannot us concern nor ever penetrate the silent urn what mean the nodding plumes the funeral train and marble monument that speaks in vain with all those cares which every nation pays to their unfeeling dead in different ways some in the flowerstrewn grave the corpse have laid and annual obsequies around it paid as if to please the poor departed shade others on blazing piles the body burn and store their ashes in the faithful urn but all in one great principle agree to give a fancied immortality why should i mention those whose ouzy soil is rendered fertile by the overflowing nile their dead they bury not nor burn with fires no graves they dig erect no funeral pires but washing first the emboweldd body clean gums spice and melted pitch they pour within then with strong fillets bind it round and round to make each flaccid part compact and sound and lastly paint the varnished surface over with the same features which in life it wore so strong their presage of a future state and that our nobler part survives the bodys fate nations behold remote from reasons beams where indian ganges rolls his sandy streams of life impatient rush into the fire and willing victims to their gods expire persuaded the loose soul to regions flies blessed with eternal spring and cloudless skies nor is less famed the oriental wife for steadfast virtue and contempt of life these heroines mourn not with loud female cries their husbands lost or with overflowing eyes but strange to tell their funeral piles ascend and in the same sad flames their sorrows end in hopes with them beneath the shades to rove and there renew their interrupted love in climes where boreas breathes eternal cold see numerous nations warlike fierce and bold to battle all unanimously run nor fire nor sword nor instant death they shun whence this disdain of life in every breast but from a notion on their minds impressed that all who for their country die are blessed add too to these the once prevailing dreams of sweet elysian groves and stygian streams all show with what consent mankind agree in the firm hope of immortality grant these the inventions of the crafty priest yet such inventions never could subsist unless some glimmerings of a future state were with the mind coaeval and innate for every fiction which can long persuade in truth must have its first foundations laid because we are unable to conceive how unembodied soul can act and live the vulgar give them forms and limbs and faces and habitations in peculiar places hence reasoners more refined but not more wise struck with the glare of such absurdities their whole existence fabulous suspect and truth and falsehood in a lump reject too indolent to learn what may be known or else too proud that ignorance to own for hards the task the daubing to pervade folly and fraud on truths fair form have laid yet let that task be ours for great the prize nor let us truths celestial charms despise because that priests or poets may disguise that there is a god from natures voice is clear and yet what errors to this truth adhere how have the fears and follies of mankind now multiplied their gods and now subjoined to each the frailties of the human mind nay superstition spread at length so wide beasts birds and onions too were deifyd the athenian sage revolving in his mind this weakness blindness madness of mankind foretold that in maturer days though late when time should ripen the decrees of fate some god would light us like the rising day through errors maze and chase these clouds away long since has time fulfilled this great decree and brought us aid from this divinity well worth our search discoveries may be made by nature void of the celestial aid let us try what her conjectures then can reach nor scorn plain reason when she deigns to teach that mind and body often sympathize is plain such is this union nature ties but then as often too they disagree which proves the souls superior progeny sometimes the body in full strength we find whilst various ails debilitate the mind at others whilst the mind its force retains the body sinks with sickness and with pains now did one common fate their beings end alike they would sicken and alike they would mend but sure experience on the slightest view shows us that the reverse of this is true for when the body often expiring lies its limbs quite senseless and half closed its eyes the mind new force and eloquence acquires and with prophetic voice the dying lips inspires of like materials were they both composed how comes it that the mind when sleep has closed each avenue of sense expatiates wide her liberty restored her bonds untied and like some bird who from its prison flies claps her exulting wings and mounts the skies grant that corporeal is the human mind it must have parts in infinitum joined and each of these must will perceive design and draw confusedly in a different line which then can claim dominion over the rest or stamp the ruling passion in the breast perhaps the mind is formed by various arts of modelling and figuring these parts just as if circles wiser were than squares but surely common sense aloud declares that site and figure are as foreign quite from mental powers as colors black or white allow that motion is the cause of thought with what strange powers must motion then be fraught reason sense science must derive their source from the wheels rapid whirl or pullys force tops whipped by schoolboys sages must commence their hoops like them be cudgeld into sense and boiling pots overflow with eloquence whence can this very motion take its birth not sure from matter from dull clods of earth but from a living spirit lodged within which governs all the bodily machine just as the almighty universal soul informs directs and animates the whole cease then to wonder how the immortal mind can live when from the body quite disjoined but rather wonder if she ever could die so framed so fashioned for eternity selfmovd not formed of parts together tied which time can dissipate and force divide for beings of this make can never die whose powers within themselves and their own essence lie if to conceive how any thing can be from shape abstracted and locality is hard what think you of the deity his being not the least relation bears as far as to the human mind appears to shape or size similitude or place clothed in no form and bounded by no space such then is god a spirit pure refined from all material dross and such the human mind for in what part of essence can we see more certain marks of immortality even from this dark confinement with delight she looks abroad and prunes herself for flight like an unwilling inmate longs to roam from this dull earth and seek her native home go then forgetful of its toil and strife pursue the joys of this fallacious life like some poor fly who lives but for a day sip the fresh dews and in the sunshine play and into nothing then dissolve away are these our great pursuits is this to live these all the hopes this muchloved world can give how much more worthy envy is their fate who search for truth in a superior state not groping step by step as we pursue and following reasons muchentangled clue but with one great and instantaneous view but how can sense remain perhaps you will say corporeal organs if we take away since it from them proceeds and with them must decay why not or why may not the soul receive new organs since even art can these retrieve the silver trumpet aids the obstructed ear and optic glasses the dim eye can clear these in mankind new faculties create and lift him far above his native state call down revolving planets from the sky earths secret treasures open to his eye the whole minute creation make his own with all the wonders of a world unknown how could the mind did she alone depend on sense the errors of those senses mend yet often we see those senses she corrects and often their information quite rejects in distances of things their shapes and size our reason judges better than our eyes declares not this the souls preeminence superior to and quite distinct from sense for sure it is likely that since now so high clogged and unfledged she dares her wings to try loosed and mature she shall her strength display and soar at length to truths refulgent ray inquire you how these powers we shall attain it is not for us to know our search is vain can any now remember or relate how he existed in the embryo state or one from birth insensible of day conceive ideas of the solar ray that lights denied to him which others see he knows perhaps you will say  and so do we the mind contemplative finds nothing here on earth that is worthy of a wish or fear he whose sublime pursuit is god and truth burns like some absent and impatient youth to join the object of his warm desires thence to sequestered shades and streams retires and there delights his passion to rehearse in wisdoms sacred voice or in harmonious verse to me most happy therefore he appears who having once unmoved by hopes or fears surveyed this sun earth ocean clouds and flame well satisfied returns from whence he came is life a hundred years or ever so few it is repetition all and nothing new a fair where thousands meet but none can stay an inn where travelers bait then post away a sea where man perpetually is tossed now plunged in business now in trifles lost who leave it first the peaceful port first gain hold then no farther launch into the main contract your sails life nothing can bestow by long continuance but continued woe the wretched privilege daily to deplore the funerals of our friends who go before diseases pains anxieties and cares and age surrounded with a thousand snares but whither hurried by a generous scorn of this vain world ah whither am i borne let none unbid the almightys standard quit however severe our post we must submit could i a firm persuasion once attain that after death no being would remain to those dark shades i would willingly descend where all must sleep this drama at an end nor life accept although renewed by fate even from its earliest and its happiest state might i from fortunes bounteous hand receive each boon each blessing in her power to give genius and science morals and good sense unenvied honors wit and eloquence a numerous offspring to the world well known both for paternal virtues and their own even at this mighty price i would not be bound to tread the same dull circle round and round the soul requires enjoyments more sublime by space unbounded undestroyd by time book ii god then through all creation gives we find sufficient marks of an indulgent mind excepting in ourselves ourselves of all his works the chief on this terrestrial ball his own bright image who alone unblest feel ills perpetual happy all the rest but hold presumptuous charge not heavens decree with such injustice such partiality yet true it is survey we life around whole hosts of ills on every side are found who wound not here and there by chance a foe but at the species meditate the blow what millions perish by each others hands in wars fierce rage or by the dread commands of tyrants languish out their lives in chains or lose them in variety of pains what numbers pinched by want and hunger die in spite of natures liberality those still more numerous i to name disdain by lewdness and intemperance justly slain what numbers guiltless of their own disease are snatched by sudden death or waste by slow degrees where then is virtues welldeservd reward  let us pay to virtue every due regard that she enables man let us confess to bear those evils which she cannot redress gives hope and conscious peace and can assuage the impetuous tempests both of lust and rage yet she is a guard so far from being sure that often her friends peculiar ills endure where vice prevails severest is their fate tyrants pursue them with a threefold hate how many struggling in their countrys cause and from their country meriting applause have fallen by wretches fond to be enslaved and perished by the hands themselves had saved soon as superior worth appears in view see knaves and fools united to pursue the man so formed they all conspire to blame and envys poisonous tooth attacks his fame should he at length so truly good and great prevail and rule with honest views the state then must he toil for an ungrateful race submit to clamor libels and disgrace threatened opposed defeated in his ends by foes seditious and aspiring friends hear this and tremble all who would be great yet know not what attends that dangerous wretched state is private life from all these evils free vice of all kinds rage envy there we see deceit that friendships mask insidious wears quarrels and feuds and laws intangling snares but there are pleasures still in human life domestic ease a tender loving wife children whose dawning smiles your heart engage the grace and comfort of softstealing age if happiness exists it is surely here  but are these joys exempt from care and fear need i the miseries of that state declare when different passions draw the wedded pair or say how hard those passions to discern ere the dyes cast and it is too late to learn who can insure that what is right and good these children shall pursue or if they should death comes when least you fear so black a day and all your blooming hopes are snatched away we say not that these ills from virtue flow did her wise precepts rule the world we know the golden ages would again begin but it is our lot in this to suffer and to sin observing this some sages have decreed that all things from two causes must proceed two principles with equal power endued this wholly evil that supremely good from this arise the miseries we endure whilst that administers a friendly cure hence life is checkered still with bliss and woe hence tares with golden crops promiscuous grow and poisonous serpents make their dread repose beneath the covert of the fragrant rose can such a system satisfy the mind are both these gods in equal power conjoined or one superior equal if you say chaos returns since neither will obey is one superior good or ill must reign eternal joy or everlasting pain whicheer is conquered must entirely yield and the victorious god enjoy the field hence with these fictions of the magis brain hence ouzy nile with all her monstrous train or comes the stoic nearer to the right he holds that whatsoever yields delight wealth fame externals all are useless things himself halfstarving happier far than kings it is fine indeed to be so wondrous wise by the same reasoning too he pain denies roast him or flay him break him on the wheel retract he will not though he cannot but feel pains not an ill he utters with a groan what then an inconvenience it is he will own what vigor health and beauty are these good no they may be accepted not pursued absurd to squabble thus about a name quibbling with different words that mean the same stoic were you not framed of flesh and blood you might be blessed without external good but know be selfsufficient as you can you are not spirit quite but frail and mortal man but since these sages so absurdly wise vainly pretend enjoyments to despise because externals and in fortunes power now mine now thine the blessings of an hour why value then that strength of mind they boast as often varying and as quickly lost a headache hurts it or a rainy day and a slow fever wipes it quite away see lord summers one whose councils one duke of marlborough whose conquering hand once saved britannias almost finking land examples of the minds extensive power examples too how quickly fades that flower dean swift him let me add whom late we saw excel in each politer kind of writing well whether he strove our follies to expose in easy verse or droll and humrous prose few years alas compel his throne to quit this mighty monarch over the realms of wit see selfsurviving he is an idiot grown a melancholy proof our parts are not our own thy tenets stoic yet we may forgive if in a future state we cease to live for here the virtuous suffer much it is plain if pain is evil this must god arraign and on this principle confess we must pain can no evil be or god must be unjust blind man whose reason such strait bounds confine that ere it touches truths extremest line it stops amazed and quits the great design own you not stoic god is just and true dare to proceed secure this path pursue twill soon conduct you far beyond the tomb to future justice and a life to come this path you say is hid in endless night it is selfconceit alone obstructs your sight you stop ere half your destined course is run and triumph when the conquest is not won by this the sophists were of old misled see what a monstrous race from one mistake is bred hear then my argument  confess we must a god there is supremely wise and just if so however things affect our sight as sings our bard pope  whatever is is right but is it right what here so often appears that vice should triumph virtue sink in tears the inference then that closes this debate is that there must exist a future state the wise extending their inquiries wide see how both states are by connection tied fools view but part and not the whole survey so crowd existence all into a day hence are they led to hope but hope in vain that justice never will resume her reign on this vain hope adulterers thieves rely and to this altar vile assassins fly but rules not god by general laws divine mans vice or virtues change not the design what laws are these instruct us if you can  there is one designed for brutes and one for man another guides inactive matters course attracting and attracted by its force hence mutual gravity subsists between far distant worlds and ties the vast machine the laws of life why need i call to mind obeyed by birds and beasts of every kind by all the sandy desarts savage brood and all the numerous offspring of the flood of these none uncontrolled and lawless rove but to some destined end spontaneous move led by that instinct heaven itself inspires or so much reason as their state requires see all with skill acquire their daily food all use those arms which nature has bestowed produce their tender progeny and feed with care parental whilst that care they need in these loved offices completely blessed no hopes beyond them nor vain fears molest man over a wider field extends his views god through the wonders of his works pursues exploring thence his attributes and laws adores loves imitates the eternal cause for sure in nothing we approach so nigh the great example of divinity as in benevolence the patriots soul knows not selfcenterd for itself to roll but warms enlightens animates the whole its mighty orb embraces first his friends his country next then man nor here it ends but to the meanest animal descends wise nature has this social law confirmed by forming man so helpless and unarmed his want of others aid and power of speech to implore that aid this lesson daily teach mankind with other animals compare single how weak and impotent they are but view them in their complicated state their powers how wondrous and their strength how great when social virtue individuals joins and in one solid mass like gravity combines this then is the first great law by nature given stamped on our souls and ratified by heaven all from utility this law approve as every private bliss must spring from social love why deviate then so many from this law see passions custom vice and folly draw survey the rolling globe from east to west how few alas how very few are blessed beneath the frozen poles and burning line what poverty and indolence combine to cloud with errors mists the human mind no trace of man but in the form we find and are we free from error and distress whom heaven with clearer light has pleased to bless whom true religion leads for she but leads by soft persuasion not by force proceeds behold how we avoid this radiant sun this proffered guide how obstinately shun and after sophistrys vain systems run for these as for essentials we engage in wars and massacres with holy rage brothers by brothers impious hands are slain mistaken zeal how savage is thy reign unpunished vices here so much abound all right and wrong all order they confound these are the giants who the gods defy and mountains heap on mountains to the sky sees this the almighty judge or seeing spares and deems the crimes of man beneath his cares he sees and will at last rewards bestow and punishments not less assured for being slow nor doubt i though this state confused appears that even in this god sometimes interferes sometimes lest man should quite his power disown he makes that power to trembling nations known but rarely this not for each vulgar end as superstitions idle tales pretend who thinks all foes to god who are her own directs his thunder and usurps his throne nor know i not how much a conscious mind avails to punish or reward mankind even in this life thou impious wretch must feel the furys scourges and the infernal wheel from mans tribunal though thou hopst to run thyself thou can not nor thy conscience shun what must thou suffer when each dire disease the progeny of vice thy fabric seize consumption fever and the racking pain of spasms and gout and stone a frightful train when life new tortures can alone supply life thy sole hope thou wilt hate yet dread to die should such a wretch to numerous years arrive it can be little worth his while to live no honors no regards his age attend companions fly he never could have a friend his flatterers leave him and with wild affright he looks within and shudders at the sight when threatening death uplifts his pointed dart with what impatience he applies to art life to prolong amidst disease and pains why this if after it no sense remains why should he choose these miseries to endure if death could grant an everlasting cure it is plain there is something whispers in his ear though fain he would hide it he has much to fear see the reverse how happy those we find who know by merit to engage mankind praised by each tongue by every heart beloved for virtues practiced and for arts improved their easy aspects shine with smiles serene and all is peace and happiness within their sleep is never disturbed by fears or strife nor lust nor wine impair the springs of life him fortune cannot sink nor much elate whose views extend beyond this mortal state by age when summoned to resign his breath calm and serene he sees approaching death as the safe port the peaceful silent shore where he may rest lifes tedious voyage over he and he only is of death afraid whom his own conscience has a coward made whilst he who virtues radiant course has run descends like a serenelysetting sun his thoughts triumphant heaven alone employs and hope anticipates his future joys so good so blessed the illustrious bishop of worcester see vol ii p  0 hough we find whose image dwells with pleasure on my mind the mitres glory freedoms constant friend in times which asked a champion to defend who after near a hundred virtuous years his senses perfect free from pains and fears replete with life with honors and with age like an applauded actor left the stage or like some victor in the olympic games who having run his course the crown of glory claims from this just contrast plainly it appears how conscience can inspire both hopes and fears but whence proceed these hopes or whence this dread if nothing really can affect the dead see all things join to promise and presage the sure arrival of a future age whatever their lot is here the good and wise nor dote on life nor peevishly despise an honest man when fortunes storms begin has consolation always sure within and if she sends a more propitious gale he is pleased but not forgetful it may fail nor fear that he who sits so loose to life should too much shun its labors and its strife and scorning wealth contented to be mean shrink from the duties of this bustling scene or when his countrys safety claims his aid avoid the fight inglorious and afraid who scorns life most must surely be most brave and he who power contemns be least a slave virtue will lead him to ambitions ends and prompt him to defend his country and his friends but still his merit you can not regard who thus pursues a posthumous reward his soul you cry is incorrupt and great who quite uninfluencd by a future state embraces virtue from a nobler sense of her abstracted native excellence from the selfconscious joy her essence brings the beauty fitness harmony of things it may be so yet he deserves applause who follows where instructive nature draws aims at rewards by her indulgence given and soars triumphant on her wings to heaven say what this venal virtuous man pursues no mean rewards no mercenary views not wealth usurious or a numerous train not fame by fraud acquired or title vain he follows but where nature points the road rising in virtues school till he ascends to god but we the inglorious common herd of man sail without compass toil without a plan in fortunes varying storms for ever tossed shadows pursue that in pursuit are lost mere infants all till lifes extremest day scrambling for toys then tossing them away who rests of immortality assured is safe whatever ills are here endured he hopes not vainly in a world like this to meet with pure uninterrupted bliss for good and ill in this imperfect state are ever mixed by the decrees of fate with wisdoms richest harvest folly grows and baleful hemlock mingles with the rose all things are blended changeable and vain no hope no wish we perfectly obtain god may perhaps might human reasons line pretend to fathom infinite design have thus ordained things that the restless mind no happiness complete on earth may find and by this friendly chastisement made wise to heaven her safest best retreat may rise come then since now in safety we have past through errors rocks and see the port at last let us review and recollect the whole  thus stands my argument  the thinking soul cannot terrestrial or material be but claims by nature immortality god who created it can make it end we question not but cannot apprehend he will because it is by him endued with strong ideas of allperfect good with wondrous powers to know and calculate things too remote from this our earthly state with sure presages of a life to come all false and useless if beyond the tomb our beings cease we therefore cannot believe god either acts in vain or can deceive if every rule of equity demands that vice and virtue from the almightys hands should due rewards and punishments receive and this by no means happens whilst we live it follows that a time must surely come when each shall meet their welladjusted doom then shall this scene which now to human sight seems so unworthy wisdom infinite a system of consummate skill appear and every cloud dispersed be beautiful and clear doubt we of this what solid proof remains that over the world a wise disposer reigns whilst all creation speaks a power divine is it deficient in the main design not so the day shall come pretend not now presumptuous to enquire or when or how  but after death shall come the important day when god to all his justice shall display each action with impartial eyes regard and in a just proportion punish and reward the arbor an ode to contentment by mr thomas cole of queens college cambridge  to these lone shades where peace delights to dwell may fortune often permit me to retreat here bid the world with all its cares farewell and leave its pleasures to the rich and great often as the summers sun shall cheer this scene with that mild gleam which points his parting ray here let my soul enjoy each eve serene here share its calm till lifes declining day no gladsome image then should scape my sight from these gay flowers which border near my eye to yon bright cloud that decks with richest light the gilded mantle of the western sky with ample gaze i would trace that ridge remote where opening cliffs disclose the boundless main with earnest ken from each low hamlet note the steeples summit peeping over the plain what various works that rural landscape fill where mingling hedgerows beauteous fields enclose and prudent culture with industrious skill her checkered scene of crops and fallows shows how should i love to mark that rivlets maze through which it works its untaught course along whilst near its grassy banks the herd shall graze and blithsome milkmaid chaunt her thoughtless song still would i note the shades of lengthening sheep as scattered over the hills slant brow they rove still note the days last glimmering luster creep from off the verge of yonder upland grove nor should my leisure seldom wait to view the slowwingd rooks in homeward train succeed nor yet forbear the swallow to pursue with quicker glance close skimming over the mead but mostly here should i delight to explore the bounteous laws of natures mystic power then muse on him who blesses all her store and give to solemn thoughts the sober hour let mirth unenvied laugh with proud disdain and deem it spleen one moment thus to waste if so she keep far hence her noisy train nor interrupt those joys she cannot taste far sweeter streams shall flow from wisdoms spring than she receives from follys costliest bowl and what delights can her chief dainties bring like those which feast the heavenlypensive soul hail silence then be thou my frequent guest for thou art wont my gratitude to raise as high as wonder can the theme suggest whenever i meditate my makers praise what joy for tutored piety to learn all that my christian solitude can teach where weakeyd reasons self may well discern each clearer truth the gospel deigns to preach no object here but may convince the mind of more than thoughtful honesty shall need nor can suspense long question here to find sufficient evidence to fix its creed it is god that gives this bower its aweful gloom his arched verdure does its roof invest he breathes the life of fragrance on its bloom and with his kindness makes its owner blessed oh may the guidance of thy grace attend the use of all thy bounty shall bestow lest folly should mistake its sacred end or vice convert it into means of woe incline and aid me still my life to steer as conscience dictates what to shun or choose nor let my heart feel anxious hope or fear for aught this world can give me or refuse then shall not wealths parade one wish excite for wretched state to barter peace away nor vain ambitions lure my pride invite beyond contentments humble path to stray what though thy wisdom may my lot deny the treasured plenty freely to dispense yet well thy goodness can that want supply with larger portions of benevolence and sure the heart that wills the generous deed may all the joys of charity command for she best loves from notice to recede and deals her unsought gifts with secret hand then will i sometimes bid my fancy steal that unclaimd wealth no property restrains soothe with fictitious aid my friendly zeal and realize each godly act she feigns so shall i gain the gold without alloy without oppression toil or treacherous snares so shall i know its use its power employ and yet avoid its dangers and its cares and spite of all that boastful wealth can do in vain would fortune strive the rich to bless were they not flattered with some distant view of what she never can give them to possess even wisdoms high conceit great wants would feel if not supplied from fancys boundless store and naught but shame makes power itself conceal that she to satisfy must promise more but though experience will not fail to show however its truth mans weakness may upbraid that what he mostly values here below owes half its relish to kind fancys aid yet should not prudence her light wing command she may too far extend her heedless flight for pleasure soon shall quit her fairyland if natures regions are not held in sight from truths abode in search of kind deceit within due limits she may safely roam if roving does not make her hate retreat and with aversion shun her proper home but thanks to those whose fond parental care to learnings paths my youthful steps confined i need not shun a state which lets me share each calm delight that soothes the studious mind while genius lasts his fame shall never decay whose artful hand first caused its fruits to spread in lasting volumes stamped the printed lay and taught the muses to embalm the dead to him i owe each fair instructive page where science tells me what her sons have known collects their choicest works from every age and makes me wise with knowledge not my own books rightly used may every state secure from fortunes evils may our peace defend may teach us how to shun or to endure the foe malignant and the faithless friend should rigid want withdraw all outward aid kind stores of inward comfort they can bring should keen disease lifes tainted stream invade sweet to the soul from them pure health may spring should both at once mans weakly frame infest some lettered charm may still relief supply against all events prepare his patient breast and make him quite resigned to live or die for though no words can time or fate restrain no sounds suppress the call of natures voice though neither rhymes nor spells can conquer pain nor magics self make wretchedness our choice yet reason while it forms the subtle plan some purer source of pleasure to explore must deem it vain for that poor pilgrim man to think of resting till his journeys over must deem each fruitless toil by heaven designed to teach him where to look for real bliss else why should heaven excite the hope to find what balkd pursuit must here for ever miss the grotto an ode to silence by the same come musing silence nor refuse to shed thy sober influence over this darkling cell the desert waste and lonely plain could never confine thy peaceful reign nor do thou only love to dwell mid the dark mansions of the vaulted dead for still at eves serenest hour all nature owns thy soothing power often have thou deigned with me to rove beneath the calm sequestered grove often deigned my secret steps to lead along the dewy pathless mead or up the dusky lawn to spy the last faint gleamings of the twilight sky then will thou still thy pensive votry meet often as he calls thee to this gloomy seat for here with solemn mystic rite were thou invoked to consecrate the ground ere these rude walls were reared remote from sight or ere with moss this shaggy roof was crowned hail blessed parent of each purer thought that does at once the heart exalt and mend here will thou never fail to find my vacant solitude inclined thy serious lessons to attend for they i ween shall be with goodness fraught whether thou bid me meditate on man in untaught natures state how far this life he ought to prize how far its transient scenes despise what heights his reason may attain and where its proud attempts are vain what toils his virtue ought to brave for hopes rewarding joys beyond the grave or if in man redeemed you bid me trace each wondrous proof of heavens transcendent grace then breathe some sparks of that celestial fire which in the raptured seraph glows above where fainted myriads crowd the joyful choir and harp their praises round the throne of love the trifling

courage bold never he calls on fortunes faith rely nor grasp her dubious gifts as property let not her smile transport her frown dismay nor praise nor blame nor wonder at her sway which reason never

sire tell then the transient bait the genius grants us at false wisdoms gate natural knowledge how far useful and when unprofitable and hurtful whatever in arts or sciences is found of solid use in their capacious round these plato reasons like a curbing rein unruly youth from devious starts restrain must we solicitous our souls to save assistance from these previous studies crave necessity there is none well not deny their merit in some less utility but they contribute we aver no part to heal the manners and amend the heart an authors meaning in a tongue unknown may glimmer through translation in our own yet masters of his language we might gain some trivial purposes by tedious pain so in the sciences though rudely taught we may attain the little that we ought yet accurately known they might convey more light not wholly useless in its way but virtue may be reached through all her rules without the curious subtleties of schools how not the learned excel the common shoal in powerful aids to meliorate the soul blind as the crowd alas to good and ill entangled by the like corrupted will what boasts the man of letters over the rest skilled in all tongues of all the arts possessed what hinders but he sink into a sot a libertine or villain in a plot miser or knave or whatsoever you will name of moral lunacy and reasons shame scandals too rife how then for living right avail those studies and their vaunted light beyond the vulgar nothing but disclose the cause from whence this strange appearance grows held by a potent charm in this retreat they dwell content with nearness to the seat of virtuous wisdom near methinks in vain since numbers often from out the nether plain scapd from the snares of lewdness and excess undevious to her lofty station press yet pass these lettered clans what then are these in moral things advantaged over the lees of human race in moral things we find these duller or less tractable of mind decypher that pride pride averts their eyes from offered light in selfsufficience wise although unknowing they presume to know clogged with that vain conceit they creep below nor can mount up to yon exalted bound true wisdoms mansion by the humble found not found by these till the vain visions spread by false opinion in the learned head repentance scatter and deceived no more they own the illusion which deceived before that for true

the right hon sir robert walpole  quod censet amiculus ut si coecus iter monstrare velit  hor by the hon mr dodington afterward lord melcombe though strength of genius by experience taught gives thee to sound the depth of human thought to trace the various workings of the mind and rule the secret springs that rule mankind rare gift yet walpole will thou condescend to listen if thy unexperienced friend can aught of use impart though void of skill and raise attention by sincere good will for friendship sometimes want of parts supplies the heart may furnish what the head denies as when the rapid rhine over swelling tides to grace old oceans coast in triumph rides though rich in source he drains a thousand springs nor scorns the tribute each small rivlet brings so thou shall hence absorb each feeble ray each dawn of meaning in thy brighter day shall like or where thou can not like excuse since no mean interest shall profane the muse no malice wrapped in truths disguise offend no flattery taint the freedom of a friend when first a generous mind surveys the great and views the crowds that on their fortune wait pleased with the show though little understood he only seeks the power to do the good thinks till he tries it is godlike to dispose and gratitude still springs when bounty flows that every grant sincere affection wins and where our wants have end our love begins but they who long the paths of state have trod learn from the clamours of the murmuring crowd which crammed yet craving still their gates besiege it is easier far to give than to oblige this of thy conduct seems the nicest part the chief perfection of the statesmans art to give to fair assent a fairer face or foften a refusal into grace but few there are that can be freely kind or know to fix the favors on the mind hence some whenever they would oblige offend and while they make the fortune lose the friend still give unthankd still squander not bestow for great men want not what to give but how the race of men that follow courts it is true think all they get and more than all their due still ask but never consult their own deserts and measure by their interest not their parts from this mistake so many men we see but ill become the thing they wish to be hence discontent and fresh demands arise more power more favor in the great mans eyes all feel a want though none the cause suspects but hate their patron for their own defects such none can please but who reforms their hearts and when he gives them places gives them parts as these oerprize their worth so sure the great may sell their favors at too dear a rate when merit pines while clamor is preferred and long attachment waits among the herd when no distinction where distinctions due marks from the many the superior few when strong cabal constrains them to be just and makes them give at last because they must what hopes that men of real worth should prize what neither friendship gives nor merit buys the man who justly over the whole presides his wellweighd choice with wise affection guides knows when to stop with grace and when advance nor gives from importunity or chance but thinks how little gratitude is owed when favors are extorted not bestowed when safe on shore ourselves we see the crowd surround the great importunate and loud through such a tumult it is no easy task to drive the man of real worth to ask surrounded thus and giddy with the show it is hard for great men rightly to bestow from hence so few are skilled in either case to ask with dignity or give with grace sometimes the great seduced by love of parts consult our genius but neglect our hearts pleased with the glittering sparks that genius flings they lift us towering on the eagles wings mark out the flights by which themselves begun and teach our dazzled eyes to bear the sun till we forget the hand that made us great and grow to envy not to emulate to emulate a generous warmth implies to reach the virtues that make great men rise but envy wears a mean malignant face and aims not at their virtues but their place such to oblige how vain is the pretense when every favor is a fresh offense by which superior power is still implied and while it helps the fortune hurts the pride slight is the hate neglect or hardships breed but those who hate from envy hate indeed since so perplexed the choice whom shall we trust methinks i hear thee cry the brave the just the man by no mean fears or hopes controlled who serves thee from affection not for gold we love the honest and esteem the brave despise the coxcomb but detest the knave no show of parts the truly wise seduce to think that knaves can be of real use the man who contradicts the public voice and strives to dignify a worthless choice attempts a task that on the choice reflects and lends us light to point out new defects one worthless man that gains what he pretends disgusts a thousand unpretending friends and since no art can make a counter pass or add the weight of gold to mimic brass when princes to bad ore their image join they more debase the stamp than raise the coin be thine that care true merit to reward and gain that good nor will the task be hard souls found alike so quick by nature blend an honest man is more than half thy friend him no mere views no haste to rise shall sway thy choice to sully or thy trust betray ambition here shall at due distance stand nor is wit dangerous in an honest hand besides if failings at the bottom lie he views those failings with a lovers eye though small his genius let him do his best our wishes and belief supply the rest let others barter servile faith for gold his friendship is not to be bought or sold fierce opposition he unmoved shall face modest in favor daring in disgrace to share thy adverse fate alone pretend in power a servant out of power a friend here pour thy favors in an ample flood indulge thy boundless thirst of doing good nor think that good alone to him confined such to oblige is to oblige mankind if thus thy mighty masters steps thou trace the brave to cherish and the good to grace long shall thou stand from rage and faction free and teach us long to love the king and thee or fall a victim dangerous to the foe and make him tremble when he strikes the blow while honor gratitude affection join to deck thy close and brighten thy decline illustrious doom the great when thus displaced with friendship guarded and with virtue graced in aweful ruin like romes senate fall the prey and worship of the wondering gaul no doubt to genius some reward is due excluding that were satirizing you but yet believe thy undesigning friend when truth and genius for thy choice contend though both have weight when in the balance cast let probity be first and parts the last on these foundations if thou dare be great and check the growth of folly and deceit when party rage shall drop through length of days and calumny be ripened into praise then future times shall to thy worth allow that fame which envy would call flattery now thus far my zeal though for the task unfit has pointed out the rocks where others split by that inspired though

to spare o could he leave his faults says fanny and bring the good alone if any poor brother tom he would grow so light the wind might rob us of him quite of habits he may well get clear ill humors

he would bite my sisters head off tween him and jenny what a clatter about a fig a mighty matter i could recount a thousand more but scandals what i most abhor molly who long had patient sat and heard in silence all their chat observing how they spoke with rancour took up my cause for which i thank her what eloquence was then displayed the charming things that molly said perhaps it suits not me to tell but faith she spoke extremely well she first with much ado put on a prudish face then thus begun heyday quoth she you let your tongue run on most strangely right or wrong it is what i never can connive at besides consider whom you drive at a person of established credit nobody better though i say it in all that is good so tried and known why girls he is quite a proverb grown his worth no

very hour he strays a lonely wretch through desert ways or shipwrecked on a foreign strand he falls beneath some ruffians hand or on the naked rock he lies and pinched by famine wastes and dies can you this hated brother see floating the sport of wind and sea can you his feeble accents hear though but in thought nor drop a tear he faintly strives his hopes are fled the billows booming over his head he mounts upon the waves again he calls on us but calls in vain to death preserves his friendship true and mutters out a kind adieu see now he rises to our sight now sinks in everlasting night here fannys color rose and fell and harriots throat began to swell one sidled to the window quite pretending some unusual sight the other left the room outright while molly laughed her ends obtained to think how artfully she feigned  the history of porsenna king of russia in two books by the same arva beata petamus arma divites et insulas hor epod    book i in russias frozen clime some ages since there dwelt historians say a worthy prince who to his peoples good confined his care and fixed the basis of his empire there enlarged their trade the liberal arts improved made nations happy and himself beloved to all the neighboring states a terror grown the dear delight and glory of his own not like those kings who vainly seek renown from countries ruined and from battles won those mighty nimrods who mean laws despise call murder but a princely exercise and if one bloodless sun should steal away cry out with titus they have lost a day who to be more than men themselves debase beneath the brute their makers form deface raising their titles by their gods disgrace like fame to bold erostratus we give who scorned by less than sacrilege to live on holy ruins raised a lasting name and in the temples fire diffused his shame far different praises and a brighter fame the virtues of the young porsenna claim for by that name the russian king was known and sure a nobler never adorned the throne in war he knew the deathful sword to wield and sought the thickest dangers of the field a bold commander but the storm oerblown he seemed as he were made for peace alone then was the golden age again restored nor less his justice honored than his sword all needless pomp and outward grandeur spared the deeds that graced him were his only guard no private views beneath a borrowed name his and the public interest were the same in wealth and pleasure let the subject live but virtue is the kings prerogative porsenna there without a rival stood and would maintain his right of doing good nor did his person less attraction wear such majesty and sweetness mingled there heaven with uncommon art the clay refined a proper mansion for so fair a mind each look each action bore peculiar grace and love itself was painted on his face in peaceful time he suffered not his mind to rust in sloth though much to peace inclined nor wanton in the lap of pleasure lay and lost to glory loiterd life away but active rising ere the prime of day through woods and lonely deserts loved to stray with hounds and horns to wake the furious bear or rouse the tawny lion from his laire to rid the forest of the savage brood and whet his courage for his countrys good one day as he pursued the dangerous sport attended by the nobles of his court it chanced a beast of more than common speed sprang from the brake and through the desert fled the ardent prince impetuous as the wind rushed on and left his lagging train behind fired with the chase and full of youthful blood over plains and vales and woodland wilds he rode urging his coursers speed nor thought the day how wasted nor how intricate the way nor till the night in dusky clouds came on restrained his pace or found himself alone missing his train he strove to measure back the road he came but could not find the track still turning to the place he left before and only laboring to be lost the more the bugle horn which over his shoulders hung so loud he winded that the forest rung in vain no voice but echo from the ground and vocal woods make mockry of the sound and now the gathering clouds began to spread over the dun face of night a deeper shade and the hoarse thunder growling from afar with herald voice proclaimed the approaching war silence awhile ensued  then by degrees a hollow wind came muttring through the trees sudden the fullfraught sky discharged its store of rain and rattling hail a mingled shower the active lightning ran along the ground the fiery bolts by fits were hurled around and the wide forests trembled at the sound amazement seized the prince  where could he fly no guide to lead no friendly cottage nigh pensive and unresolved awhile he stood beneath the scanty covert of the wood but drove from thence soon sallied forth again as chance directed on the dreary plain constrained his melancholy way to take through many a loathsome bog and thorny brake caught in the thicket floundring in the lake wet with the storm and wearied with the way by hunger pinched himself to beasts a prey nor wine to cheer his heart nor fire to burn nor place to rest nor prospect to return drooping and spiritless at lifes despair he bade it pass not worth his farther care when suddenly he spied a distant light that faintly twinkled through the gloom of night and his heart leaped for joy and blessed the welcome sight ofttimes he doubted it appeared so far and hung so high twas nothing but a star or kindled vapor wandering through the sky but still pressed on his steed still kept it in his eye till much fatigue and many dangers past at a huge mountain he arrived at last there lighting from his horse on hands and knees gropd out the darksome road by slow degrees crawling or clambring over the rugged way the thunder rolls above the flames around him play joyful at length he gained the steepy height and found the rift whence sprang the friendly light and here he stopped to rest his wearied feet and weigh the perils he had still to meet unsheathed his trusty sword and dealt his eyes with caution round him to prevent surprise then summoned all the forces of his mind and entering boldly cast his fears behind resolved to push his way whatever withstood or perish bravely as a monarch should while he the wonders of the place surveyed and through the various cells at random strayed in a dark corner of the cave he viewed somewhat that in the shape of woman stood but more deformed than dreams can represent the midnight hag or poets fancy paint the lapland witch when she her broom bestrides and scatters storms and tempests as she rides she looked as nature made her to disgrace her kind and cast a blot on all the race her shriveld skin with yellow spots besmeared like moldy records seemed her eyes were bleard her feeble limbs with age and palsy shook bent was her body haggard was her look from the dark nook outcrept the filthy crone and proppd upon her crutch came tottering on the prince in civil guise approached the dame told her his piteous case and whence he came and till aurora should the shades expel implored a lodging in her friendly cell mortal whoever thou art the fiend began and as she spoke a deadly horror ran through all his frame his cheeks the blood forsook chatterd his teeth his knees together struck whoever thou art that with presumption rude dare on our sacred privacy intrude and without license in our court appear know you are the first that ever entered here but since thou pleadst excuse you are hither brought more by thy fortune than thy own default thy crime though great an easy pardon finds for mercy ever dwells in royal minds and would you learn from whose indulgent hand you live and in whose aweful presence stand know farther through yon wide extended plains great eolus the king of tempeus reigns and in this lofty palace makes abode well suited to his state and worthy of the god the various elements his empire own and pay their humble homage at his throne and hither all the storms and clouds resort proud to increase the splendour of his court his queen am i from whom the beauteous race of winds arose sweet fruit of our embrace she scarce had ended when with wild uproar and horrid din her sons impetuous pour around the cave came rushing in amain lybs eurus boreas all the boisterous train and close behind them on a whirlwind rode in clouded majesty the blustering god their locks a thousand ways were blown about their cheeks like fullblown bladders strutted out their boasting talk was of the feats the had done of trees uprooted and of towns overthrown and when they kindly turned them to accost the prince they almost pierced him with their frost the gaping hag in fixed attention stood and at the close of every tale cried  good blessing with outstretchd arms each darling son in due proportion to the mischief done and where said she does little zephyr stray know ye my sons your brothers rout today in what bold deeds does he his hours employ grant heaven no evil has befallen my boy never was he known to linger thus before scarce had she spoke when at the cavern door came lightly tripping in a form more fair than the young poets fond ideas are when fired with love he tries his utmost art to paint the beauteous tyrant of his heart a satin vest his slender shape confined embroidered over with flowers of every kind floras own work when first the goddess strove to win the little wanderer to her love of burnished silver were his sandals made silver his buskins and with gems oerlaid a saffroncolourd robe behind him flowed and added grace and grandeur as he trod his wings than lilies whiter to behold sprinkled with azure spots and streaked with gold so thin their form and of so light a kind that they for ever danced and fluttered in the wind around his temples with becoming air in wanton ringlets curled his auburn hair and over his shoulders negligently spread a wreath of fragrant roses crowned his head such his attire but o no pen can trace no words can show the beauties of his face so kind so winning so divinely fair eternal youth and pleasure flourish there there all the little loves and graces meet and every thing that is soft and every thing that is sweet thou vagrant cried the dame in angry tone where could thou loiter thus so long alone little thou carst what anxious thoughts molest what pangs are laboring in a mothers breast well do you show your duty by your haste for thou of all my sons art always last a child less fondled would have fled more fast sure it is a curse on mothers doomed to mourn where best they love the least and worst return my dear mama the gentle youth replied and made a low obeisance cease to chide nor wound me with your words for well you know your zephyr bears a part in all your woe how great must be his sorrow then to learn that he himselfs the cause of your concern nor had i loiterd thus had i been free but the fair princess of felicity entreated me to make some short delay and asked by her who could refuse to stay surrounded by the damsels of her court she sought the shady grove her loved resort fresh rose the grass the flowers were mixed between like rich embroidry on a ground of green and in the midst protected by the shade a crystal stream in wild meanders played while in its banks the trembling leaves among a thousand little birds in concert sung close by a mount with fragrant shrubs oergrown on a cool mossy couch she laid her down her air her posture all conspired to please her head upon her snowy arm at ease reclined a studied carelessness expressed loose lay her robe and naked heaved her breast eager i slew to that delightful place and poured a shower of kisses on her face now hovered over her neck her breast her arms like bees over flowers and tasted all her charms and then her lips and then her cheeks i tried and fanned and wantoned round on every side o zephyr cried the fair thou charming boy thy presence only can create me joy to me thou art beyond expression dear nor can i quit the place while thou art here excuse my weakness madam when i swear such gentle words joined with so soft an air pronounced so sweetly from a mouth so fair quite ravished all my sense nor did i know how long i staid or when or where to go meanwhile the damsels debonnair and gay prattled around and laughed the time away these in soft notes addressed the ravished ear and warbled out so sweet twas heaven to hear and those in rings beneath the greenwood shade danced to the melody their fellows made some studious of themselves employed their care in weaving flowery wreaths to deck their hair while others to some favorite plant conveyed refreshing showers and cheered its drooping head a joy so general spread through all the place such satisfaction dwelt on every face the nymphs so kind so lovely looked the queen that never eye beheld a sweeter scene porsenna like a statue fixed appeared and wrapped in silent wonder gazed and heard much he admired the speech the speaker more and dwelt on every word and grieved to find it over o gentle youth he cried proceed to tell in what fair country does this princess dwell what regions unexplord what hidden coast can so much goodness so much beauty boast to whom the winged god with gracious look numberless sweets diffusing while he spoke thus answered kind  these happy gardens lie far hence removed beneath a milder sky their name  the kingdom of felicity sweet scenes of endless bliss enchanted ground a soil for ever sought but seldom found though in the search all human kind in vain weary their wits and waste their lives in pain in different parties different paths they tread as reason guides them or as follies lead these wrangling for the place they never shall see debating those if such a place there be but not the wisest nor the best can say where lies the point or mark the certain way some few by fortune favored for her sport have sailed in sight of this delightful port in thought already seized the blessed abodes and in their fond delirium ranked with gods fruitless attempt all avenues are kept by dreadful foes sentry that never slept here fell detraction darts her poisonous breath fraught with a thousand stings and scatters death sharpsighted envy there maintains her post and shakes her flaming brand and stalks around the coast these on the helpless bark their fury pour plunge in the waves or dash against the shore teach wretched mortals they were doomed to mourn and never must rest but in the silent urn but say young monarch for what name you bear your mien your dress your person all declare and though i seldom fan the frozen north yet i have heard of brave porsennas worth my brother boreas through the world has flown swelling his breath to spread forth your renown say would you choose to visit this retreat and view the world where all these wonders meet wish you some friend over that tempestuous sea to bear you safe behold that friend in me my active wings shall all their force employ and nimbly waft you to the realms of joy as once to gratify the god of love i bore fair psyche to the cyprian grove or as joves bird descending from on high snatched the young trojan trembling to the sky there perfect bliss thou may for ever share scapd from the busy world and all its care there in the lovely princess thou shall find a mistress ever blooming ever kind all ecstacy on air porsenna trod and to his bosom strained the little god with grateful sentiments his heart oerflowd and in the warmest words millions of thanks bestowed when eolus in surly humor broke their strict embrace and thus abruptly spoke enough of compliment i hate the sport of meanless words this is no human court where plain and honest are discarded quite for the more modish title of polite where in soft speeches hypocrites impart the venomed ills that lurk beneath the heart in friendships holy guise their guilt improve and kindly kill with specious show of love for us  my subjects are not used to wait and waste their hours to hear a mortal prate they must abroad before the rising sun and hie em to the seas there is mischief to be done excuse my plainness sir but business stands and we have storms and shipwrecks on our hands he ended frowning and the noisy rout each to his several cell went puffing out but zephyr far more courteous than the rest to his own bower conveyed the royal guest there on a bed of roses neatly laid beneath the fragrance of a myrtle shade his limbs to needful rest the prince applied his sweet companion slumbering by his side book ii no sooner in her silver chariot rose the ruddy morn than sated with repose the prince addressed his host the god awoke and leaping from his couch thus kindly spoke this early call my lord that chides my stay requires my thanks and i with joy obey like you i long to reach the blissful coast hate the slow night and mourn the moments lost the bright rosinda loveliest of the fair that crowd the princess court demands my care even now with fears and jealousies oerborn upbraids and calls me cruel and forsworn what sweet rewards on all my toils attend serving at once my mistress and my friend just to my love and to my duty too well paid in her well pleased in pleasing you this said he led him to the cavern gate and clasped him in his arms and poised his weight then balancing his body here and there stretched forth his agile wings and launched in air swift as the fiery meteor from on high shoots to its goal and gleams athwart the sky here with quick fan his laboring pinions play there glide at ease along the liquid way now lightly skim the plain with even flight now proudly soar above the mountains height spiteful detraction whose envenomed hate sports with the sufferings of the good and great spares not our prince but with opprobrious sneer arraigns him of the heinous sin of fear that he so tried in arms whose very name infused a secret panic where it came even he as high above the clouds he flew and spied the mountains lessening to the view naught round him but the wide expanded air helpless abandoned to a striplings care struck with the rapid whirl and dreadful height confessed some faint alarm some little fright the friendly god who instantly divined the terrors that possessed his fellows mind to calm his troubled thoughts and cheat the way described the nations that beneath them lay the name the climate and the soils increase their arms in war their government in peace showed their domestic arts their foreign trade what interest they pursued what leagues they made the sweet discourse so charmed porsennas ear that lost in joy he had no time for fear from scandinavias cold inclement waste over wide germanias various realms they past and now on albions fields suspend their toil and hover for a while and bless the soil over the gay scene the prince delighted hung and gazed in rapture and forgot his tongue till bursting forth at length behold cried he the promised isle the land i longed to see those plains those vales and fruitful hills declare my queen my charmer must inhabit there thus raved the monarch and the gentle guide pleased with his error thus in smiles replied i must applaud my lord the lucky thought even i who know the original am caught and doubt my senses when i view the draught the slowascending hill the lofty wood that mantles over its brow the silver flood wandering in mazes through the flowery mead the herd that in the plenteous pastures feed and every object every scene excites fresh wonder in my soul and fills with new delights dwells cheerful plenty there and learned ease and art with nature seems at strife to please there liberty delightful goddess reigns gladdens each heart and gilds the fertile plains there firmly seated may she ever smile and shower her blessings over her favorite isle but see the rising sun reproves our stay he said and to the ocean winged his way stretching his course to climates then unknown nations that swelter in the burning zone there in peruvian vales a moment staid and smoothed his wings beneath the citron shade then swift his oary pinions plied again crossed the new world and sought the southern main where many a wet and weary league oerpast the wished for paradise appeared at last with force abated now they gently sweep over the smooth surface of the shining deep the dryads hailed them from the distant shore the nereids played around the tritons swam before while soft favonius their arrival greets and breathes his welcome in a thousand sweets nor pale disease nor healthconsuming care nor wrath nor foul revenge can enter there no vapourd foggy gloom imbrowns the sky no tempests rage no angry lightnings fly but dews and soft refreshing airs are found and pure aetherial azure shines around whatever the sweet sabaean soil can boast or meccas plains or indias spicy coast what hyblas hills or rich oebalias fields or flowery vale of famed hymettus yields or what of old the hesperian orchard graced all that was ever delicious to the taste sweet to the smell or lovely to the view collected there with added beauty grew hightowring to the heavens the trees are seen their bulk immense their leaf for ever green so closely interwove the telltale sun can never descry the deeds beneath them done but where by sits the sportive gales divide their tender tops and fan the leaves aside like a smooth carpet at their feet lies spread the matted grass by bubbling fountains fed and on each bough the feathered choir employ their melting notes and naught is heard but joy the painted flowers exhale a rich perfume the fruits are mingled with eternal bloom and spring and autumn hand in hand appear lead on the merry months and join to cloth the year here over the mountains shaggy summit poured from rock to rock the tumbling torrent roared while beauteons iris in the vale below paints on the rising fumes her radiant bow now through the meads the mazy current strayed now hid its wandrings in the myrtle shade or in a thousand veins divides its store visits each plant refreshes every flower over gems and golden sands ha murmurs flows and sweetly soothes the soul and lulls to soft repose if hunger call no sooner can the mind express her will to needful food inclined but in some cool recess or opening glade the seats are placed the tables neatly laid and instantly conveyed by magic hand in comely rows the costly dishes stand meats of all kinds that nature can impart prepared in all the nicest forms of art a troop of sprightly nymphs arrayed in green with flowery chaplets crowned come scudding in with fragrant blossoms these adorn the feast those with officious zeal attend the guest beneath his feet the silken carpet spread or sprinkle liquid odours over his head others in ruby cups with roses bound delightful deal the sparkling nectar round or weave the dance or tune the vocal lay the lyres resound the merry minstrels play gay health and youthful joys overspread the place and swell each heart and triumph in each face so when emboldened by the vernal air the busy bees to blooming fields repair for various use employ their chymic power one culls the snowy pounce one sucks the flower again to different works returning home some or stive stipant steeve the honey some erect the comb all for the general good in concert strive and ever souls in motion every limbs alive and now descending from his flight the god on the green turf released his precious load there after mutual salutations past and endless friendship vowed they part in haste zephyr impatient to behold his love the prince in raptures wandering through the grove now skipping on and singing as he went now stopping short to give his transports vent with sudden gusts of happiness oppressed or stands entranced or raves like one possessed his mind afloat his wandering senses quite overcome with charms and frantic with delight from scene to scene by random steps conveyed admires the distant views explores the secret shade dwells on each spot with eager eye devours the woods the lawns the buildings and the bowers new sweets new joys at every glance arise and every turn creates a fresh surprise close by the borders of a rising wood in a green vale a crystal grotto stood and over its side beneath a beechen shade in broken falls a silver fountain played hither attracted by the murmuring stream and cool recess the pleased porsenna came and on the tender grass reclining chose to wave his joys awhile and take a short repose the scene invites him and the wanton breeze that whispers through the vale the dancing trees the warbling birds and rills that gently creep all join their music to prolong his sleep the princess for her morning walk prepared the female troops attend a beauteous guard arrayed in all her charms appeared the fair tall was her stature unconfined her air proportion decked her limbs and in her face lay love inshrind lay sweet attractive grace tempring the aweful beams her eyes conveyed and like a lambent flame around her played no foreign aids by mortal ladies worn from shells and rocks her artless charms adorn for grant that beauty were by gems increased it is rendered more suspected at the least and foul defects that would escape the sight start from the piece and take a stronger light her chestnut hair in careless rings around her temples waved with pinks and jesmine crowned and gathered in a silken cord behind curled to the waist and floated in the wind over these a veil of yellow gauze she wore with amaranths and gold embroidered over her snowy neck half naked to the view gracefully fell a robe of purple hue hung loosely over her slender shape and tried to shade those beauties that it could not hide the damsels of her train with mirth and song frolic behind and laugh and sport along the birds proclaim their queen from every tree the beasts run frisking through the groves to see the loves the pleasures and the graces meet in antic rounds and dance before her feet by whatever fancy led it chanced that day they through the secret valley took their way and to the crystal grot advancing spied the prince extended by the fountains side he looked as by some skilful hand expressed apollos youthful form retired to rest when with the chase fatigued he quits the wood for pindus vale and aganippes flood there sleeps secure his careless limbs displayed at ease encircled by the laurel shade beneath his head his sheaf of arrows lie his bow unbent hangs negligently by the slumbering prince might boast an equal grace so turned his limbs so beautiful his face waking he started from the ground in haste and saw the beauteous choir around him placed then summoning his senses ran to meet the queen and laid him humbly at her feet deign lovely princess to behold said he one who has traversed all the world to see those charms and worship thy divinity accept thy slave and with a gracious smile excuse his rashness and reward his toil stood motionless the fair with mute surprise and read him over with admiring eyes and while she steadfast gazed a pleasing smart ran thrilling through her veins and reached her heart each limb she scanned considered every grace and sagely judged him of the phoenix race an animal like this she never had known and thence concluded there could be but one the creature too had all the phoenix air none but the phoenix could appear so fair the more she looked the more she thought it true and called him by that name to show she knew o handsome phoenix for that such you are we know your beauty does your breed declare and i with sorrow own through all my coast no other bird can such perfection boast for nature formed you single and alone alas what pity it is there is but one were there a queen so fortunate to show an aviary of charming birds like you what envy would her happiness create in all who saw the glories of her state the prince laughed inwardly surpised to find so strange a speech so innocent a mind the compliment indeed did some offense to reason and a little wronged her sense he could not let it pass but told his name and what he was and whence and why he came and hinted other things of high concern for him to mention and for her to learn and she ad a piercing wit of wondrous reach to comprehend whatever he could teach thus hand in hand they to the palace walk pleased and instructed with each others talk here should i tell the furnitures expense and all the structures vast magnificence describe the walls of shining sapphire made with emerald and pearl the floors inlaid and how the vaulted canopies unfold a mimic heaven and flame with gems and gold or how felicity regales her guest the wit the mirth the music and the feast and on each part bestow the praises due twould tire the writer and the render too my amorous tale a softer path pursues love and the happy pair demand my muse o could her art in equal terms express the lives they lead the pleasures they possess fortune had never so plenteously before bestowed her gifts nor can she lavish more it is heaven itself it is ecstacy of bliss uninterrupted joy untird excess mirth following mirth the moments dance away love claims the night and friendship rules the day their tender care no cold indiffrence knows no jealousies disturb their sweet repose no sickness no decay but youthful grace and constant beauty shines in either face benumming age may mortal charms invade flowers of a day that do but bloom and fade far different here on them it only blows the lilys white and spreads the blushing rose no conquest over those radiant eyes can boast they like the stars shine brighter in its frost nor fear its rigor nor its rule obey all seasons are the same and every month is may alas how vain is happiness below man soon or late must have his share of woe slight are his joys and fleeting as the wind his griefs wound home and leave a sting behind his lot distinguished from the brute appears less certain by his laughter than his tears for ignorance too often our pleasure breeds but sorrow from the reasoning soul proceeds if man on earth in endless bliss could be the boon young prince had been bestowed on thee bright shone thy stars thy fortune flourished fair and seemed secure beyond the reach of care and so might still have been but anxious thought has dashed thy cup and thou must taste the draught it so befell as on a certain day this happy couple toyd their time away he asked how many charming hours were flown since on her slave her heaven of beauty shone should i consult my heart cried he the rate were small a week would be the utmost date but when my mind reflects on actions past and counts its joys time must have fled more fast perhaps i might have said three months are gone three months replied the fair three months alone know that three hundred years have rolled away since at my feet the lovely phoenix lay three hundred years reechoed back the prince a whole three hundred years completed since i landed here o whither then are flown my dearest friends my subjects and my throne how strange alas how altered shall i find each earthly thing each scene i left behind who knows me now on whom shall i depend to gain my rights where shall i find a friend my crown perhaps may grace a foreign line a race of kings that know not me nor mine who reigns may wish my death his subjects treat my claim with scorn and call their prince a cheat oh had my life been ended as begun my destined stage my race of glory run i should have died well pleased my honored name had lived had flourished in the list of fame reflecting now my mind with horror sees the sad survey a scene of shameful ease the odious blot the scandal of my race scarce known and only mentioned with disgrace the fair beheld him with impatient eye and red with anger made this warm reply ungrateful man is this the kind return my love deserves and can you thus with scorn reject what once you prized what once you swore surpassed all charms and made even glory poor what gifts have i bestowed what favors shown made you partaker of my bed and throne three centuries preserved in youthful prime safe from the rage of death and injuries of time weak arguments for glory reigns above the feeble ties of gratitude and love i urge them not nor would request your stay the phantom glory calls and i obey all other virtues are regardless quite sunk and absorbed in that superior light go then barbarian to thy realms return and show thyself unworthy my concern go tell the world your tender heart could give death to the princess by whose care you live at this a deadly pale her cheeks overspread cold trembling seized her limbs her spirits fled she sunk into his arms the prince was moved felt all her griefs for still he greatly loved he sighed he wished he could forget his throne confine his thoughts and live for her alone but glory shot him deep the venomed dart was fixed within and rankled at his heart he could not hide its wounds but pined away like a sick flower and languishd in decay an age no longer like a month appears but every month becomes a hundred years felicity was grieved and could not bear a scene so changed a sight of so much care she told him with a look of cold disdain and seeming ease as women well can feign he might depart at will a milder air would mend his health he was no prisoner there she kept him not and wished he never might find cause to regret the place he left behind which once he loved and where he still must own he had at least some little pleasure known if these prophetic words awhile destroy his peace the former balance it in joy he thanked her for her kind concern but chose to quit the place the rest let heaven dispose for fate on mischiefs bent perverts the will and first infatuates whom it means to kill aurora now not as she wont to rise in gay attire tinged with a thousand dies but sobersad in solemn state appears clad in a dusky veil bedewed with tears thick mantling clouds beneath her chariot spread a faded wreath hangs drooping from her head the sickening sun emits a feeble ray half drowned in fogs and struggling into day some black event the threatening skies foretell porsenna rose to take his last farewell a curious vest the mournful princess brought and armor by the lemnian artist wrought a shining lance with secret virtue stored and of resistless force a magic sword caparisons and gems of wondrous price and loaded him with gifts and good advice but chief she gave and what he most would need the fleetest of her stud a flying steed the swift grisippo said the afflicted fair such was the coursers name with speed shall bear and place you safely in your native air assist against the foe with matchless might ravage the field and turn the doubtful fight with care protect you till the danger cease your trust in war your ornament in peace but this i warn beware whatever shall lay to intercept your course or tempt your stay quit not your saddle nor your speed abate till safely landed at your palace gate on this alone depends your weal or woe such is the will of fate and so the gods foreshew he in the softest terms repaid her love and vowed nor age nor absence should remove his constant faith and sure she could not blame a short divorce due to his injured fame the debt discharged then should her soldier come gay from the field and flushed with conquest home with equal ardour her affection meet and lay his laurels at his mistress feet he ceased and sighing took a kind adieu then urged his steed the fierce grisippo flew with rapid force outstrippd the lagging wind and left the blissful shores and weeping fair behind now over the seas pursued his airy flight now scowerd the plains and climbed the mountains height thus driving on at speed the prince had run near half his course when with the setting sun as through a lonely lane he chanced to ride with rocks and bushes fenced on either side he spied a wagon full of wings that lay broke and oerturnd across the narrow way the helpless driver on the dirty road lay struggling crushed beneath the incumbent load never in human shape was seen before a wight so pale so feeble and so poor comparisons of age would do him wrong for nestors self if placed by him were young his limbs were naked all and worn so thin the bones seemed starting through the parchment skin his eyes half drowned in rheum his accents weak bald was his head and furrowed was his cheek the conscious steed stopped short in deadly fright and back recoiling stretched his wings for flight when thus the wretch with supplicating tone and rueful face began his piteous moan and as he spoke the tears ran trickling down o gentle youth if pity ever inclined thy soul to generous deeds if ever thy mind was touched with soft distress extend thy care to save an old mans life and ease the load i bear so may propitious heaven your journey speed prolong your days and all your vows succeed moved with the prayer the kind porsenna staid too noblyminded to refuse his aid and prudence yielding to superior grief leaped from his steed and ran to his relief removed the weight and gave the prisoner breath just choked and gasping on the verge of death then reached his hand when lightly with a bound the grizly spectre vaulting from the ground seized him with sudden gripe the astonished prince stood horrorstruck and thoughtless of defense o king of russia with a thundering sound bellowed the ghastly fiend at length you are found receive the ruler of mankind and know my name is time thy everdreaded foe these feet

morn with more than usual care she sped but oh what joy to find him there as just arrived and weary with the way retired to soft repose her hero lay now near approaching she began to creep with careful steps loath to disturb his sleep till quite overcome with tenderness she flew and round his neck her arms in transport threw but when she found him dead no tongue can tell the pangs she felt

the author of this dialogue and of the three subsequent poems was educated in westminster college and from thence elected to christ church in oxford where he took the degrees of m a march         and of b d dec      0  on his coming to the university he was very soon distinguished by dean aldrich he passed through the usual offices in his college to that of censor with considerable reputation and for some years had the principal noblemen and gentlemen belonging to the society committed to his care in this useful employment he continued until his merits recommended him to sir jonathan trelawny bishop of winchester who appointed him his chaplain and soon after gave him a prebend in his own cathedral together with the rectory of brightwell in the county of berks which afforded him ample provision for a learned retirement in which he remained to the end of his days and so well satisfied was he with a recluse life that he could not be drawn from it by the repeated solicitations of those who thought him qualified for a more public character and a higher station his death which happened june  0      was occasioned by his falling into a ditch that led to his garden door the path being narrow and part of it giving way under his feet  s cease chlorinda cease to chide me when my passion i relate why should kindness be denied me why should love be paid with hate if the fruit of all my wishes must be to be treated so what could you do more than this is to your most outrageous foe  c simple strephon cease complaining talk no more of foolish love think not ever my heart to reign in think not all you say can move did i take delight to fetter thrice ten thousand slaves a day thrice ten thousand times your betters gladly would my rule obey  s strive not fairest to unbind me let me keep my pleasing chain charms that first to love inclined me will for ever love maintain would you send my heart a roving first to love i must forbear would you have me cease from loving you must cease from being fair  c strephon leave to talk thus idly let me hear of love no more you mistake chlorinda widely thus to teize her over and over seek not her who still forbids you to some other tell your moan choose wherever your fancy leads you let chlorinda but alone  s if chlorinda still denies me that which none but she can give let the whole wide world despise me it is for her alone i live grant me yet this one poor favor with this one request comply let us each go on for ever i to ask and you deny  c since my strephon you so kind are all pretensions to resign trust chlorinda  you may find her less severe than you divine strephon struck with joy beholds her would have spoke but knew not how but he looked such things as told her more than all his speech could do  to chlorinda by the same see strephon what unhappy fate does on thy fruitless passion wait adding to flame fresh fuel rather than thou should favor find the kindest soul on earths unkind and the best nature cruel the goodness which chlorinda shows from mildness and good breeding flows but must not love be styled or else it is such as mothers try when wearied with incessant cry they still a froward child she with a graceful mien and air genteely civil yet severe bids thee all hopes give over friendship she offers pure and free and who with such a friend as she could want or wish for more the cur that swam along the flood his mouth well filled with morsel good too good for common cur by visionary hopes betrayed gaping to catch a fleeting shade lost what he held before mark strephon and apply this tale lest love and friendship both should fail where then would be thy hope of hope quoth strephon talk not friend and for applying  know the end of every curs a rope the fable of ixion to chlorinda by the same ixion as the poets tell us was one of those pragmatic fellows who claim a right to kiss the hand of the best lady in the land demonstrating by dint of reason that impudence in loves no treason he let his fancy soar much higher and ventured boldly to aspire to junos high and mighty grace and wooed the goddess face to face what mortal ever had whims so odd to think of cuckolding a god for she was both joves wife and sister and yet the rascal would have kissed her how he got up to heavens high palace not one of all the poets tell us it must be therefore understood that he got up which way he could nor is it that i know recorded how bows were made and speeches worded so leaving this to each ones guess i will only tell you the success but first i stop awhile to show what happened lately here below chlorinda who beyond compare of all the fairones is most fair chlorinda by the gods designed to be the pattern of her kind with every charm of face and mind glanced lightning from her eyes so blue and shot poor strephon through and through he over head and ears her lover tried all the ways he could to move her he sighed and vowed and prayed and cried and did a thousand things beside she let him sigh and pray and cry on  but now hear more about ixion the goddess proud as folks report her disdained that mortal wight should court her and yet she chose the fool to flatter to make him fancy some great matter and hope in time he might get at her graced him with now and then a smile but inly scorned him all the while resolved at last a trick to show him seeming to yield and so undo him now which way do you think she took for do it she would by hook or crook why thus i find it in my book she called a pretty painted cloud the brightest of the wandering crowd for she you know is queen of the air and all the clouds and vapors there governs at will by nod or summons as walpole does the house of commons this cloud which came to her starknaked she dressed as fine as hands could make it for her own wardrobe out she brought whatever was dainty wove or wrought a smock which pallas spun and gave her once on a time to gain her favor a gown that have not on earth its fellow of finest blue and lined with yellow fit for a goddess to appear in and not a pin the worse for wearing a quilted petticoat beside with whalebone hoop six fathom wide with these she decked the cloud do you see as like herself as like could be so like that could not i or you know which was the cloud and which was juno thus dressed she sent it to the villain to let him act his wicked will on then laughed at the poor fool aloud who for a goddess grasped a cloud this you will say was well done on her to expose the tempter of her honor  but more of him you need not hear only to strephon lend an ear he never entertained one thought with which a goddess could find fault his spotless love might be forgiven by every saint in earth and heaven juno herself though nice and haughty would not have judged his passion naughty all this chlorindas self confessed and owned his flame was pure and chaste read what his teeming muse brought forth and praised it far beyond its worth mildly received his fond address and only blamed his loves excess yet she so good so sweet so smiling so full of truth so unbeguiling one way or other still devised to let him see he was despised and when he plumed and grew most proud all was a vapor all a cloud a tale to chlorinda by the same dame venus a daughter of joves and amongst all his daughters most fair lost it seems tother day the two doves that wafted her car through the air the dame made a heavy sad rout ran about heaven and earth to condole em and sought high and low to find out where the biddyes were strayed or who stole em to the god who the stragglers should meet she promised most tempting fine pay six kisses than honey more sweet and a seventh far sweeter than they the proposal no sooner was made but it put all the gods in a flame for who would not give all he had to be kissed by so dainty a dame to cyprus to paphos they run where the goddess often used to retire some rode round the world with the sun and searched every country and shire but with all their hard running and riding not a god of em claimed the reward for no one could tell tale or tiding if the doves were alive or were starved at last the sly shooter of men young cupid i beg the gods pardon mamma your blue birds i have seen in a certain terrestrial garden where where my dear child quickly show quoth the dame almost out of her wits do but go to chlorindas says cu and you will find em in shape of pewits is it she that has done me this wrong full well i know her and her arts she has followed the thieving trade long but i thought she dealt only in hearts i shall soon make her know so i shall  and with that to joves palace she run and began like a bedlam to bawl i am cheated i am robbed i am undone chlorinda whom none can appproach without losing his heart or his senses has stolen the two doves from my coach and now flaunts it at venus expenses she has changed the poor things to pewits and keeps em like ordinary fowls so when she robs men of their wits she turns em to asses or owls i could tell you of many a hundred of figure high station and means whom she without mercy has plundered ever since she came into her teens but her thefts upon earth i would have borne or have let em all pass for mere fable but nothing will now serve her turn but the doves out of venuss stable is it fit let your mightyship say that i like some pityful flirt should tarry within doors all day or else trudge it afoot in the dirt is it fit that a mortal should trample on me who am styld queen of beauty o make her great jove an example and teach nimblefingers her

with your prattle the fair who has done you no wrong and scorns to purloin goods and chattel she needs neither gewgaw nor trinket to carry the world all before her her deserts i would have you to think it are enough to make all men adore her your doves are elopd i confess and choose with chlorinda to dwell but blame not the lady for this for sure it is no crime to excel as for them i applaud

rustic shed within this humble bed her twittering progeny contains the swallow sweeps the plains or lightly skims from level lakes the dew the ringdove ever true in plaintive accents tells of unrelenting fate far from the ravens croak and bird of night that shrieking wings her flight when at his muttered rite hid in the dusky desert vale with starting eye and visage pale the grimly wizard sees the specter rise unholy but haunts the woods that held her beauteous mate and wooes the echo soft with murmurs melancholy i   sublime alone the feathered monarch flies his nest dark mists upon

speaks each aged ear plays truant at his tales and younger hearings are quite ravished so voluble is his discourse  gentle as zephyr blowing underneath the violet not wagging its sweet head  yet as rough his noble blood enchaffd as the rude wind that by the top does take the mountain pine and make him stoop to the vale  it is wonderful that an invisible instinct should frame him to loyalty unlearned honor untaught civility not seen in other knowledge that wildly grows in him but yields a crop as if it had been sown what a piece of work how noble in faculty infinite in reason a

declares thy fate great as he was you see how small the gain a burial so obscure a muse so mean extempore verses upon a trial of skill between the two great masters of defense messieurs figg and sutton by dr byrom dr john byrom was a younger son of mr edward byrom of kersal in the county of lancaster linendraper he received his education at merchant taylors school from whence he went to trinity college cambridge where he became a pensioner july     0  having taken his degrees in arts he was chosen fellow of his college in      but not inclining to enter into holy orders he was obliged to quit his place in      and soon afterward married his cousin miss elizabeth byrom this union involved him in more expense than he was able to support and he was compelled to have recourse to teaching shorthand for the maintenance of his family after some years his elder brother died and the family estate devolved to him this occased him first to relax his attention to business and then to relinquish  he died at manchester september          i long was the great figg by the prizefighting swains sole monarch acknowledged of marybone plains to the towns far and near did his valor extend and swam down the river from them to gravesend where lived mr sutton pipemaker by trade who hearing that figg was thought such a stout blade resolved to put in for a share of his fame and so sent to challenge the champion of them ii with alternate advantage two trials had past when they fought out the rubbers on wednesday last to see such a contest the house was so full there hardly was room left to thrust in your skull with a prelude of cudgels we first were saluted and two or three shoulders most handsomely fluted till weary at last with inferior disasters all the company cried come the masters the masters iii whereupon the bold sutton first mounted the stage made his honors as usual and yearnd to engage then figg with a visage so fierce yet sedate came and entered the lists with his freshshaven pate their arms were encircled with armigers too with a red ribbon suttons and figgs with a blue thus adorned the two heroes twixt shoulder and elbow shook hands and went to it and the word it was bilboe iv sure such a concern in the eyes of spectators was never yet seen in our amphitheatres our commons and peers from their several places to half an inch distance all pointed their faces while the rays of old phoebus that shot through the skylight seemed to make on the stage a new kind of twilight and the gods without doubt if one could but have seen em were peeping there through to do justice between em v figg struck the first stroke and with such a vast fury that he broke his huge weapon in twain i assure you and if his brave rival this blow had not warded his head from his shoulders had quite been discarded figg armed him again and they took to other tilt and then suttons blade ran away from its hilt the weapons were frighted but as for the men in truth they never minded but at it again vi such a force in their blows you would have thought it a wonder every stroke they received did not cleave em asunder yet so great was their courage so equal their skill that they both seemed as safe as a thief in a mill while in doubtful attention dame victory stood and which side to take could not tell for her blood but remained like the ass twixt the bundles of hay without ever stirring an inch either way vii till jove to the gods signified his intention in a speech that he made em too tedious to mention but the upshot on it was that at that very bout from a wound in figgs side the hot blood spouted out her ladyship then seemed to think the case plain but figg stepping forth with a sullen disdain showed the gash and appealed to the company round if his own broken sword had not given him the wound viii that bruises and wounds a mans spirit should touch with danger so little with honor so much well they both took a dram and returned to the battle and with a fresh fury they made the swords rattle while suttons right arm was observed to bleed by a touch from his rival so jove had decreed just enough for to show that his blood was not ichor but made up like figgs of the common redliquor ix again they both rushed with as equal a fire on till the company cried hold enough of cold iron to the quarterstaff now lads so first having dramd it they took to their wood and in faith never shammd it the first bout they had was so fair and so handsome that to make a fair bargain was worth a kings ransom and sutton such bangs on his neighbor imparted would have made any fibers but figgs to have smarted x then after that bout they went on to another  but the matter must end on some fashion or other so jove told the gods he had made a decree that figg should hit sutton a stroke on the knee though sutton disabled as soon as he hit him would still have fought on but jove would not permit him twas his fate not his fault that constrained him to yield and thus the great figg became lord of the field a letter from cambridge to master henry archer a young gentleman at eton school by dr littleton dr edward littleton was educated upon the royal foundation at eton school from whence he was transplanted to kings college cambridge in the year      after four years residence at the university he was recalled to eton as an assistant in the school where he so greatly acquired the respect of the provost and fellows that in      they elected him into their society and presented him to the living of maple derham in oxfordshire on june the  th    0 he was appointed chaplain in ordinary to their majestys and in the same year took his doctor of laws degree at cambridge he died of a fever in the year      and was buried in his own parish church of maple derham  though plagued with algebraic lectures and astronomical conjectures weaned from the sweets of poetry to scraps of dry philosophy you see dear hal i have found a time to express my thoughts to you in rhyme for why my friend should distant parts or time disjoin united hearts since though by intervening space deprived of speaking face to face by faithful emissary letter we may converse as well or better and not to stretch a narrow fancy to show what pretty things i can say as some will strain at simile first work it fine and then apply add butlers rhymes to priors thoughts and choose to mimic all their faults by head and shoulders bring in a stick to show their knack at hudibrastic i will tell you as a friend and irony how here i spend my time and money for time and money go together as sure as weathercock and weather and thrifty guardians all allow this grave reflection to be true that whilst we pay so dear for learning those weighty truths we have no concern in the spark who squanders time away in vain pursuits and fruitless play not only proves an arrant blockhead but what is much worse as out of pocket whether my conduct bad or good is judge from the nature of my studies no more majestic virgils heights nor towering miltons loftier flights nor courtly horaces rebukes who banters vice with friendly jokes nor congreves life nor cowleys fire nor all the beauties that conspire to place the greenest bays upon the immortal brows of addison priors inimitable ease nor popes harmonious numbers please how can poetic flowers abound how spring in philosophic ground homer indeed if i would show it was both philosopher and poet but tedious philosophic chapters quite stifle my poetic raptures and i to phoebus bade adieu when first i took my leave of you now algebra geometry arithmetic astronomy optics chronology and statics all tiresome points of mathematics with twenty harder names than these disturb my brains and break my peace all seeming inconsistencies are nicely solved by as and bs our senses are disproved by prisms our arguments by syllogisms if i should confidently write this ink is black this paper white or to express myself yet fuller should say that black or whites a color they would contradict it and perplex one with motion light and its reflection and solve the apparent falsehood by the curious texture of the eye should i the poker want and take it when it looks as hot as fire can make it and burn my finger and my coat they would flatly tell me it is not hot the fire say they has in it it is true the power of causing heat in you but no more heats in fire that heats you than there is pain in stick that beats you thus too philosophers expound the names of odor taste and sound the salts and juices in all meat affect the tongues of them that eat and by some secret poignant power give them the taste of sweet and sour carnations violets and roses cause a sensation in our noses but then there is none of us can tell the things themselves have taste or smell so when melodious mason sings or gething tunes the trembling strings or when the trumpets brisk alarms call forth the cheerful youth to arms conveyed through undulating air the musics only in the air we are told how planets roll on high how large their orbits and how nigh i hope in little time to know whether the moons a cheese or no whether the man in it as some tell ye with beef and carrots fills his belly why like a lunatic confined he lives at distance from mankind when he at one good hearty shake might whirl his prison off his back or like a maggot in a nut full bravely eat his passage out who knows what vast discoveries from such inquiries might arise but feuds and tumults in the nation disturb such curious speculation cambridge from

his friendship cracks his brains sure is a madman if he feigns the indolent what selfsufficiency and false content denumb the senses of the indolent dead to all purposes of good or ill alive alone in an unactive will his only vice in no good action lies and his sole virtue is his want of vice business he deems too hard trifles too easy and doing nothing finds himself too busy silence he cannot bear noise is distraction noise kills with bustle silence with reflection no want he feels  what has he to pursue to him it is less suffer than to do the busy worlds a fool the learned a sot and his sole hope to be by all forgot wealth is procured with toil and kept with fear knowledge by labor purchased costs too dear friendships a clog and family a jest a wife but a bad bargain at the best honor a bubble subject to a breath and all engagements vain since nulled by death thus all the wise esteem he can despise and caring not it is he alone is wise yet all his wish possessing finds no

found with bodies how to cloth ideas taught and how to draw the picture of a thought who taught the hand to speak the eye to hear a silent language roving far and near whose softest noise outstrips loud thunders sound and spreads her accents through the worlds vast round a voice heard by the deaf spoke by the dumb whose echo reaches long long time to come which dead men speak as well as those alive  tell me what genius did this art contrive the answer the noble art to cadmus owes its rise of painting words and speaking to the eyes he first in wondrous magic fetters bound the airy voice and stopped the flying sound the various figures by his pencil wrought gave color form and body to the thought on wit true wit is like the brilliant stone dug from the indian mine which boasts two various

he feels and indolently hangs his rapid wing while gentle sleep his closing eyelid seals and over his heaving limbs in loose array to every balmy gale the ruffling feathers play here if we except the second line we find no imagery or expression of the lyrical cast the rest are loaded with unnecessary epithets and would better suit the tamers tones of elegy m   perching on the sceptered hand of jove thy magic lulls the feathered king with ruffled plumes and flagging wing quenched in dark clouds of slumber lie the terror of his beak and lightnings of his eye i   power of harmony to produce

pleasures frisking light in frolic measures now pursuing now retreating now in circling troops they meet to brisk notes in cadence beating imitation  homers od th g glance their manytwinkling feet slow this and the five following lines which follow are sweetly introduced by the short and unequal measures that precede them the whole stanza is indeed a masterpiece of rhythm and charms the ear by its wellvaried cadence as much as the imagery which it contains ravishes the fancy there is says our author in one of his manuscript papers a toute ensemble of sound as well as of sense in poetical composition always necessary to its perfection what is gone before still dwells upon the ear and insensibly harmonizes with the present line as in that succession of fleeting notes which is called melody nothing can better exemplify the truth of this fine observation than his own poetry m melting strains their queens approach declare wherever she turns the graces homage pay with arms sublime

feathercinctured chiefs and dusky loves her tract wherever the goddess roves glory pursue and generous shame the unconquerable mind and freedoms holy flame ii   progress of poetry from greece to italy and from italy to england chaucer was not unacquainted with the writings of dante or of petrarch the earl of surrey and sir thomas wyatt had traveled in italy and formed their taste there spenser imitated the italian writers milton improved on them but this school expired soon after the restoration and a new one arose on the french model which has subsisted ever since g woods that wave over delphis steep isles that crown the egaean deep fields that cool illissus laves or where maeanders amber waves in lingering labrinths creep how do your tuneful echos languish mute but to the voice of anguish where each old poetic mountain inspiration breathed around every shade and hallowed fountain murmured deep a solemn sound till the sad nine in greeces evil hour left their parnassus for the latian plains alike they scorn the pomp of tyrantpower and coward vice that revels in her chains when latium had her lofty spirit lost they sought oh albion next thy seaencircled coast iii   an ingenious person who sent mr gray his remarks anonymously on this and the following ode soon after they were published gives this stanza and the following a very just and wellexpressed eulogy a poet is perhaps never more conciliating than when he praises favorite predecessors in his art milton is not more the pride than shakspeare the love of their country it is therefore equally judicious to diffuse a tenderness and a grace through the praise of shakspeare as to extol in a strain more elevated and sonorous the boundless soarings of miltons epic imagination the critic has here well noted the beauty of contrast which results from the two descriptions yet it is further to be observed to the honor of our poets judgment that the tenderness and grace in the former does not prevent it from strongly characterizing the three capital persections of shakspeares genius and when he describes his power of exciting terror a species of the sublime he ceases to be diffuse and becomes as he ought to be concise and energetical m far from the sun and summergale in thy green lap was natures darling shakspeare g laid what time where lucid avon strayed to him the mighty mother did unveil her aweful face the dauntless child stretched forth his little arms and smiled this pencil take she said whose colors dear richly paint the vernal year thine too these golden keys immortal boy this can unlock the gates of joy or horror that and thrilling fears or open the sacred source of sympathetic tears iii   nor second he milton g  that rode sublime upon the seraphwings of ecstasy the secrets of the abyss to spy imitation  flammantia moenia mundi lucretius he passed the flaming bounds of place and time imitation for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels and above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne as the appearance of a sapphirestone  this was the appearance of the glory of the lord ezekiel i  0     the living throne the sapphireblaze where angels tremble while they gaze he saw but blasted with excess of light imitation  homer od g this has been condemned as a false thought and more worthy of an italian poet than of mr gray count algarotti we have found in his letter to mr how praises it highly but as he was an italian critic his judgment in this point will not perhaps by many be thought to overbalance the objection the truth is that this fiction of the cause of miltons blindness is not beyond the bounds of poetical credibility any more than the fiction which precedes it concerning the birth of shakspeare and therefore would be equally admissible had it not the peculiar misfortune to encounter a fact too well known on this account the judgment revolts against it milton himself has told us in a strain of heartfelt exultation see his sonnet to cyriac skynner that he lost his eyesight  overplyd in libertys defense his noble task whereof all europe rings from side to side   and when we know this to have been the true cause we cannot admit a fictitious one however sublimely conceived or happily expressed if therefore so lofty and unrivalled a description will not atone for this acknowledged defect in relation to matter of fact all that the impartial critic can do is to point out the reason and to apologize for the poet who was necessitated by his subject to consider milton only in his poetical capacity  since the above note was published mr brand of eastdearham in norfolk has favored me with a letter in which he informs me of a very similar hyperbole extant in a ms commentary upon platos phaedon written by hermias a christian philosopher of the second century and which is printed in bayles dictionary art achilles it contains the following anecdote of homer  that keeping some sheep near the tomb of achilles he obtained by his offerings and supplications a sight of that hero who appeared to him surrounded with so much glory that homer could not bear the splendour of it and that he was not only dazzled but blinded by the sight the ingenious gentleman makes no doubt but mr gray took his thought from this passage and applauds him for the manner in which he has improved upon it he also thinks in general that a deviation from historical truth though it may cast a shade over the middling beauties of poetry produces no bad effect where the magnificence and brilliancy of the images entirely fill the imagination and with regard to this passage in prticular he intimates that as the cause of miltons blindness is not so well known as the thing itself the license of poetical invention may allow him to assign a cause different from the real fact however this may be the very exact resemblance which the two thoughts bear to one another will i hope vindicate mr grays from being a modern concetto in the taste of the italian school as it has been deemed to be by some critics but this resemblance will do more and it is on this account chiefly that i produce and thank the gentleman for communicating it it will prove the extreme uncertainty of decding upon poetical imitations for i am fully persuaded that mr gray had never seen or at least attended to this greek fragment how scrupulus he was in borrowing even an epithet from another poet many of his notes on this very ode fully prove and as to the passage in question he would certainly have cited it for the sake of vindicating his own taste by classical authority especially when the thought had been so much controverted   closed his eyes in endless night behold where drydens less presumptuous car wide

the first when he completed the conquest of that country ordered all the bards that fell into his hands to be put to death  i    on this noble exordium the anonymous critic beforementioned thus eloquently expresses his admiration this abrupt execration plunges the reader into that sudden fearful perplexity which is designed to predominate through the whole the irresistible violence of the prophets passions bears him away who as he is unprepared by a formal ushering in of the speaker is unfortified against the impressions of his poetical phrenzy and overpowered by them as sudden

two of these paintings both believed to be originals one at florence the other in the duke of orleans collection at paris g  mr gray never saw the large cartoon done by the same divine hand in the possession of the duke of montagu at his seat at boughton in northamptonshire else i am persuaded he would have mentioned it in his note the two finished pictures abroad which i believe are closetpieces can hardly have so much spirit in them as this wonderful drawing it gave me the sublimest idea i ever received from painting moses breaking the tables of the law by parmegiano was a figure which mr gray used to say came still nearer to his meaning than the picture of raphael m   loose his beard and hoary hair streamed like a meteor to the troubled air and with a masters hand and

expression and cadence are admirably adapted to the character and situation of the speaker and of the bloody specter his assistants it is not indeed peculiar to it alone but a beauty that runs throughout the whole composition that the historical events are briefly sketched out by a few striking circumstances in which the poets office of rather exciting and directing than satisfying the readers imagination is perfectly observed such abrupt hints resembling the several fragments of a vast ruin suffer not the mind to be raised to the utmost pitch by one image of horror but that instantaneously a second and a third are presented to it and the affection is still uniformly supported anon critic m weave the warp and weave the woof the winding sheet of edwards race give ample

and sometimes useful to be informed how a writer frequently improves on his original thoughts on this account i have occasionally set down the few variations which mr gray made in his lyrical composition the six lines before us convey perhaps the most beautiful piece of imagery in the whole ode and were a wonderful improvement on those which he first wrote which though they would appear fine in an inferior poet are infinitely below those which supplanted them i find them in one of his corrected manuscripts as follow variation mirrors of saxon truth and loyalty your helpless old

pathetic address which from the sentiments and also from the numbers has all the melancholy flow and breathes all the plaintive softness of elegy again the scene changes again the bard rises into an

distinguishing their merits endeavored to select and preserve the best the favorable reception which the former volumes have met with demands my warmest acknowledgments and calls for all my care in completing the collection and in this respect if it appear that i have not been altogether negligent i shall hope to be allowed the merit which is all i claim of having furnished to the public an
