new discoveries and improvements in the most considerable branches of anatomy and surgery  wherein four of the most dangerous operations are prevented viz  i the great use of the curvecatheter in a suppression of urine and easing the racking pain of the stone in the bladder ii ruptures of all kinds cured without cutting iii the diveded tendon cured without stitching iv the whiteswelling cured without dismembering v the best method for the reduction of fractures and dislocations vi the nature of gunshot and other wounds and of the errors committed in bleeding vii the true seat of the gonorrhaea demonstrated and cure of the venereal disease viii of the circulation of the blood in the foetus and the nourishment thereof ix of the parts of generation in women etc the whole proposed by

in search of things laudable and praiseworthy ambition is a virtue prior to other men those of our profession are required to pursue their progressive improvement in this case but we must climb the hill virtue sits of top care is painful the charge of men and womens lives and limbs revolves the surgeons breast to retain his tranquillity he is to proceed in his business according to the received maxims and approved method of the best practitioners learning gives tranquillity of mind it points the road to reputation and riches  it is a maxim among infidels to speak well of all men as far as virtue will permit slander is base and does recriminate it is far from me to derogate from the masters of your hospital st tho  s but who among such folks imparts his knowledge and if they do ought not young men to proceed in their research reputation lost is hardly retrievable we are not to risk this rashly on the other hand the world is apt to form a great idea of a surgeon of an enterprizing genius they presume that his knowledge is well founded so they may being attended with success temerity puts a man off his guard this is subject to great danger  the reduction of fractures and dislocations is a great and necessary article in a surgeons business to decline this is inconsistent with his character see himself postponed to a country fellow in all other respects inferior to him granting that many of those people set bones at random you will not easily be believed in saying so even when they miscarry there is reason to retort that good surgeons fail in this case though men are required to speak truth it would be a hardship on surgeons to tell all which they know or believe they would confess that sometimes the swelling confounds them in distinguishing the species of fractures particularly luxations this reflection ought to put young surgeons under an indispensible obligation to distinguish the great variety also of sub luxations and be familiarly conversant with the her rules of art to arm against cngencies when you have n instructed in the osteology the myology and the angiology the history of the bones the muscles and the blood vessels you will cut without danger by the dis and replace of the head of the bone see how and where the muscles and ligaments are banded and relaxed then from the intense pain the privation of motion and the position judge where the distortion is made notwithstanding the swelling this rule will direct you in adjusting the extension and in moderating the violence  when the femur the thigh is dislocated backward i mean when the head of the bone is under the gluti or fleshchi the three extensor muscles of the femur all authors as well as other surgeons agree few contradict that the reduction is impractible by reason that the head of the bone cannot be removed especially in that the ligament tarsor being broke the bone will not keep in it is place i will demonstrate how this luxation may be reduced and by what means the ligament restored  rules will be given respecting fractures particularly the oblique and transversefracture of the femur the thigh bone which cannot be felt by reason aforesaid  excellent directions will be given to keep the compoundfracture free from pain and without the exfoliating the bone cure the wound with facility and promptitude in departing from these rules the menacing accidents rising high the life of the diseased is cast away or hangs in doubt  you will be apprized of an error in a reputed great author wiseman this for many years has been a stumbling block to his practisingsuccessors and sometimes fatal to the subject if he escaped with his life he underwent a long weakness and not seldom a deformity in his limb i am acquainted with a gentleman a shameful example of this error in two great surgeons in concert one of them a grandee of the first class the afflicted deplores the remembrance of his sorrow and the loss of the use of his elbow these in a great measure might have been prevented with no danger of his life or lameness little pain loss of time or expense comparative  by the indication of the pulse and of the urine you may betimes animate your digestive then by change of dressing turn gradually the redundant discharge to incarn the wound and generate and confirm the callous this practice must needs be just seeing that by certain tokens in the matter or discharge this is known to be the chyle and indeed the native balm of the blood which cures all wounds in this case old people seldom recover their strength the spirit and balsam of the blood is evaporated this is become cadaverous  if i do not take upon me to determine the controverted hypotheses in theory it is not improbable but in this i shall make a pleasing advance  in this sentiment you will find yourself in condition to distinguish books was i to speak my opinion of them i must own that there are not many worth reading it is not hard to comprize in a sheet or two of paper what is material in some of the best of them particularly those of the practice of surgery  with a copious and beautiful variety of topics you shall have the occasional method of internal prescription to digest wounds of the brain and wounds of the viscera of all other gunshot wounds in the joints are formidable to nature application of actuating fortifying and resolutive medecines of various kinds not generally known are to be made according to the exigency of the wound the surgeon is to steer his course as it were between charybdis and scylla a rock and a sand as they term it without adding fuel to the burning fever he is to cherish the genus nervosam from thence the interessing soul sends continually succors of animal spirits in aid of nature in the unequal war with her united cruel enemies pain fever thirst burning watching delirium in failure of these spirits to rarify and animate the condensing blood to digest the wound alleviate the pain and support or strengthen the heart laboring under the redoubling pulse the mortal symptoms prevailing the noble organs ceasing to perform their vital and animal functions the soul deprived of her power is forced to depart  you should learn to despamate secern and transfer the dangerous rellux of purulent matter oppressing the blood and animal spirits with restlessness fever delirium the hickok lethargy apoplexy convulsions etc the harbinger of death  upon a sudden suppression of sweat sometimes this becomes a hetorene humor and with pungent pain vellicats the intestines the missentory the pleura the mediastinum the pericranium and other parts greatly subject to resentment of all cases this embarasses the surgeon secretion being the work of nature he cannot appoint the time nor till this is accomplished hardly obtain a respite or cessation of the violence this seems to have been the late case of a great king which for what we could perceive his physicians and surgeons knew yet like a starrost with his hand on his sabre in senate they were for defending their argument in the antichamber  laudanum is our great anodyne this we are forbid it restrains the transfusion of the animal spirits on which depends the function and formality of the parts also the energy of the secerning blood a continued use of this medicine may render the disease incurable or of a long duration purging and bleeding interrupt nature she has chose to deliver herself by the denographical or culicular glands and will not be controuled perspirating alexipharmic and volatile medicines are of a little effect till toward the crisis nature alone maintains the conflict hence it happens that sometimes she does not overcome till from a vernal solstice chiefly the blood has received an accession of warmth to ferment and discharge in the surface  some years ago i tended a gentleman who upon drinking cold water when hot and sweating was seized with a violent pain in the nervous tunicle of his bowels after a tedious indisposition a large abscess was formed in his groin though i opened the swelling as soon as it fluctuated the blood and spirits were so tainted and charged with this foreign humor that he had an accelerated a low and an irregular pulse was delirious had cold clam sweatings an hickok a diarrhea and a gangarene round the border of the wound also an advanced mortification on the inside of that knee in five or six days the wound discharged so many quarts of a lixive ganger lymph when the mortification was stopped and a separation made one might turn his hand in the wound quite to the peritoneum in sight now the mortal symptoms began to remit in less than five weeks the wound was sicatrized you will agree that the cure depended on proper internals had there been a defect in the dressings he must have perished so he would had i fatigued him with pain  between two and three years ago one mrs gyles had for year before a continual diarrhea or lienterria the chyle or nourishment ran off the greatest part of it before it entered the lacteals in the spring of the year a large cold white fluctuating swelling grew on her right hypondria below the ribs from the beginning she had an aching pain shooting deep into the liver the seat or source of her indisposition a suppressed sweat transferred a considerable surgeon in town told her to be well advised in whom she trusted and that he did not open the swelling too soon in about a week i stopped the looseness in eight or nine days more the swelling became warm and reddish but frightfully increased in bigness i told her now was the time she yielding i opened the swelling with a lancet there was a basin of a quart and half a pint of formed matter caught here and there streaked with blood toward the end she and others who saw the shifted cloths and bedding did believe that in    hours the wound did run a gallon and in four nights two quarts more in all six quarts the return of the diarrhea was what i apprehended most this happened the first night attended with cold clam sweating a trembling pulse and fainting so again the second night and were as often taken off in few days more she mended daily and in three weeks was quite well then she grew fat healthful and strong she is lately married to james tailor a whitesmith in hatfieldstreet  in five weeks i cured a gentlewoman of a large mortification in her loins extending on the os sacrum and the coxis to affect the sphinctures of the anus and the bladder cut off the course of the spirits that she rendered her excrements involuntary in the beginning she had a fever of the spirits a delirium cold sweatings and a syncopa  these cures well understood and the medicines given will with variations be a precedent in many grand cases nor are the internal things mentioned in any book on such occasions yet which no phycisian or surgeon speaking without prejudice can disavow they will and must needs own that if any one ever was these people all of them by medicine were brought back from the gates of the grave  what deserves remark there was no ruburb or astringent no opiate or theriaca given in the diarrhea the cortex suspends or restrains secretion so does laudanum this shuts the avenues of the nerves binding or centering the animal spirits it leavens the blood and opposes digestion and reunion i shall occasionally speak farther of these medicines and how they may be given safely here they would have been mortal by reason of the nervous fever  in case of a collection in the mediastinum de verney says we may trepan the sternum he was professor of anatomy in the royal garden at paris and probably the greatest that ever lived taken throughout he illustrated his demonstrations of all parts of the body with his comparative anatomy of horses calves dogs cats fowl fish frogs eggs including his public lectures and course of operations his course of anatomy lasted from the beginning of september till the end of march all the week sundays and holidays excepted from morning till night an hour at noon allowed he was forty years royalprofessor had read all valuable books was thought to be one of the greatest orators in france being of easy access his scholars had a fair opportunity of improvement his papers would have made a volume little less than a churchbible but they never were published few can judge of the loss yet this may easily be perceived in the defects and impertinencies in mens discourse and writings on this subject some who hold their heads high  you shall see the several intentions practiced to restrain the affluence of suppuration which procrastinates and defeats the cure of wounds and renders ulcers sinous callous and fistulous then by exalting and displaying rebating and correcting the blood render this subservant to your purpose  you will be entertained with an essay on the hernia of the parts will learn to disengage the intestine ilion strangled in the tendous perforation of the great oblique the external muscle of the abdomen and how to prevent the return of the ilion into the inguin or groin such is the force of a few external medicines that they effect the cure of the rupture in people advanced in years if i do not say without help of a truss this i have done upon considering them well and how they are adapted to several purposes cooperating you will perceive that they bear the greatest congruity to reason and probability of success should they fail or fall short in what is promised others are appointed to sustain the effort strike off the symptoms as they arrive in fine you shall have a system of prescriptions to traverse the train of appearances and anticipate the dangerous operation of the bubonocele or strangled rupture even when the vermicular the peristaltic or natural motion of the intestines is inverted and they vomit their excrements as in the micere or iliac passion  ask at mr baker a cooper in nottinghamstreet i cured his wife of a strangling of the bowels attended with violent pain and sickness when without passage downwards she for eight days vomited every thing that she took  when on this occasion and probably in this manner you have had the good fortune to redeem or ransom men from death you should fence them with strength brace the unbended muscles and the expanded tendons restore the resort of the relaxed ring to withstand the protrusion of the intestine and of the epiploon into the ain or inguin and the scrotum the seat of the bubonocele and of the complete hernia  i have a sheet of paper wrote throughout on the cause and cure of the rupture  from the long and oftentimes repeated experience which i have had of my method of cure of the rupture i will and do engage to take only twenty shillings for things nor will i ask more if i do not cure the diseased absolutely if through neglect or otherwise they do not profane the use of my medicines i will put them to no pain trouble or inconveniency farther than to wear a cottontruss  0 or    days till my medicines do take place  you will take notice that this promise is to be understood with some exceptions or restrictions respecting great age and weakness  mr mitchell colourman over against haberdashers hospital in hoxton had his eldest son born with a complete rupture i cured him at ten years old  a scholar at the latin boarding school at edmonton was lately cured by me of a complete rupture on both sides the intestine or bowel quite down in the scrotum send to mr harrow master of the boarding school  you shall learn to supercede successfully the stitch or suture of the tendon cure the wound and recover the use of the part sooner and with far less pain than by the operation  the cure of the painful anchylose or white swelling in the joint is a consideration of no little import and known but to a few you shall see how to give a present judgment of this and cure all curable kinds this will go far i have wrought miracles of this sort so may you with help of my thesis on this subject  i have an essay on the circulation of the blood in the foetus and on the nourishment of the foetus  what is alluring to the ear you shall hear a discourse on the parts of generation in women and on the law of formation the preexistence of lineaments in the ovum  i will annex an essay on the passions and affections accounting for them from the near and familiar consent of the various plexus of nerves and the intimate correspondence of the animal spirits reciprocating in them  you shall be convinced of the certainty of extracting the stone in the urethra without danger of having the wound remain fistulous  to many opposite digressions on the other great and necessary heads of anatomy and surgery i will give a process on the bronchocele the glairous swelling of the glands thyroides threatening a suffocation from the pressure of the swelling on the flexible part of the annular cartilages of the aspera arteria  about a year ago i opened an ulcer in the roof of captain hughess mouth i exfoliated and took out the bone of the pallat inquire at mrs starkys in deanstreet by redlyon square the captain will show the bone and that the wound stands sound nor can you perceive any alteration in his speech  three years ago i opened and cured a scrofolous or kings evil swelling in a gentlewomans neck inquire at mr kitchens baker in bucklestreet by red lyonstreet goodman fields  an eminent surgeon in town will witness that when with three bolusses of fourteen grains of my panacea i fluxed a man thirty days i opened the ulcerated skin of his nose i cauterized the carious bones several times i took out the bridge the ossa nasalia both of them and without sinking the spungy bone underneath to make a blemish i cured him also of an ulcer in his throat large enough to receive a small apple an exostosis on his wrist and one on the second joint of his great toe of all which he held well several years till he died of another distemper i recovered a woman brought to bed in the height of her flux under all the dengerous circumstances of a great effusion other surgeons give   0 grains of mercurius dulcis or more consequently my method of cure of the venerel disease is much safer nor is it less effectual than a flux raised by unction whereas their method of salivation comes far short in certainty  i saw a great surgeon in town give fourteen grains of mercurius dulcis and seven grains of turbith mineral or yellow mercury for one dose in a gonorrhaea a running of the reins as they call it he told me that the brotherhood speak as they please but this is what they give and even in greater quantity whereas i do not exceed ten grains of my panacea and that castrated of its vitriolic corrosive points in which is the danger it is by this means that so small a quantity of my panacea raises a salivation it is true that i mix another powder but you shall be satisfied that this has no relation to mercury of any kind nor is it subject to ill consequence  turbith mineral causes worse effects of this i give none it weakens and relaxes the medul spinalis or back bone marrow the root of the nerves of the inferior parts that they cannot receive the animal spirits nor indeed the impression of the imagination to push them thus defrauded of spirits the stamen of sense and motion the muscles of the loins lose their action and strength more or less  old gleets proceed from what the french call a debility or laxness of the vessels the emunctory of the prostates purging makes the case worse astringents are dangerous i stop gleetings of a long standing by tempering the heat and ferment of the humor by a medicine absolutely safe and pleasant to take  you will expect that i should give my opinion of the seat or source of the gonorrhaea we are commanded to strive for truth this obliges me to speak affirmatively in contradiction to a book on the hypothesis of the lacunae and the patrons of this theory of dr cockburn   monsieur de verney the gentleman already mentioned showed an ulcer in the prostates of a man who had this distemper when he died i heard him also say that from thence came the matter or discharge in this case  the prostates lie on the depending part of the bladder near the sphincter and the erector muscles of the penis the inflammation and swelling of the ulcer is soon communicated to those parts through the porous tunicles of the bladder from this it is easy to account for the heat the stoppage and strangury of the urine also for the pain and cordee in the time of erection  what i am going to say will cast the balance and determine the controversy on my side absolutely  it is manifest that a discharge of matter must come from a wound consistent with this demonstrative proposition it is found that the excoriation or ulcer of the prostatesglands is always antecedent to the gonorrhaea whereas that of the lucanae does not happen of some time after sooner or later according to the heat and sharpness of the urine and of the running from the prostates so the excoriation or ulcer of the lacunae can be only an effect or consequence of those symptoms i mean that the heat and sharpness of the urine and of the vitiated discharge of the ulcer in the prostates passing often through the urethra does chafe and fret the thin and tender membrane of the lacunae so occasions an ulcer or excoriation in this part  in a long and great discharge the prostates are found to waste and in the end to shrink and shrivel to almost nothing while the excoriation of the lacunae remains without alteration these reasons rise to a demonstration of my assertion the experiment may soon be made in the hospitals  the succus or juice of the prostates is the vehicle which conveys the volatile semen into the uterus when this is spent and the prostates withered men become incapable of procreation but fertile nature recovers some as by a miracle  as in the prostates a long and great discharge of matter or nutritious juice from the lacunae would run sinous the cavernous body of the penis and give as little trouble to cure it  we should find it impractible to restore the masculine proportion of the penis  but these accidents do not happen therefore the seat of the gonorrhaea is not in the lacunae  i was bred in st thomass hospital under mr william coatesworth after this i was two years under the celebrated de verney at paris and in the hospitals there  a great man in town was my pupil now he is a physician he does not scruple to own that he formed himself chiefly on the anatomy etc which i taught him his father was a surgeon of good account he chose me to educate his son preferable to any man in town so he used to say i have bred several other surgeons some of them are much sought to in setting bones  dr james keill was a gentleman no less valued for his integrity than his knowledge in anatomy i have inserted a certificate from him  take down in writing three or four remarkable cases in cure in your hospital according to the number and order of your queries i will account for the appearances from the fabric the function and situation of the parts  have you a mind to hear something previous inquire out a professor of anatomy i will meet him at his appointed time and place to answer and question him on this subject if he thinks fit the controverted points shall be submitted to the wardens of surgeons hall or to two other professors or physicians and a third to adjudge  sir the swelling in your ladys throat is what surgeons call the bronchocele or hernia gutterii but to speak in particular i say it is a distention of the glands thyroides they are two in number situated on the opposite sides of the larynx and the superior part of the aspira arteria sinking to the flexible part of the anular cartilages the use of these glands is to strain from the blood a vicous glairous liquor to lubrify the cartilages of the larynx to facilitate their motion they as well as other glands are greatly subject to cold defluxions they are the principal fountains and recervatories of the lympha thus we may believe that this cold humor is also sent thither from the salivary sources and other glands adjacent it is easy to think that as the thyroides glands swell and take up a greater space they press the flexible part of the anular cartilages aforesaid obliging them to yield they straiten the trachia arteria this occasions the great difficulty of breathing and threatening of suffocation  on this principle we render reason for the loss of her voice the recrurent nerves suffers a compression animal spirits are wanting in the muscles to play the cartilages of the larynx to form the voice she is worse when with child on account that the blood and humors are more determined to the superior parts especially in that as the abdomen grows big it presses the diaphragma against the lungs so lessens the capacity of the thorax and hinders respiration parallel to this is the case of dropsical people always oppressed with shortness of breath i mean in the true ascites when the lower belly is filled with water  the great swelling gives reason to believe that the whole substance of these glands is sapped and distended with this cold humor like a sponge in water the sojourn of which has rendered their texture so extremely lax that they will not recover their resort consequently not admit of cure hence it is hard to promise more than to prevent an extremity for which if purging bleeding espesially sweating fortifying discussing drying and corrugating spirits with the emplastrum divinum diasulpharis de ranis and saponis spread and embrocated frequently with os succini redificati should not prove effectual one may venture to apply a caustic on each side the aspira arteria thereby procuring a plentiful suppuration the humor may bedrained and the swelling sunk but remembering that digestion depends on the sweet influence of the warm blood and spirits in the parts of which in some sort this swelling being deprived it may be feared that the wound will languish and ulcerate   on the circulation of the blood in the foetus and on the nourishment of the foetus waving the exploded opinion of the ancients concerning the manner of nourishment of the foetus the foetus is nourished by the blood without doubt this depends principally on the blood or rather on the assimulating chyle  the epigastric artery of the mother transfuses incessantly into the placenta the blood brought into the placenta the secundine or afterbirth a determined quantity of blood this is received by the vena umbilicalis the navel string the navelstring receives the blood from the mother and carried in the porta through the liver thence in the conduit venae to the vena cava which empties in the right ventricle of the heart of the foetus the blood circulated in the foetus this machine put into contraction sends what blood can pass through the foramen ovale and the remainder into the arteria pulmonaris but nature to favor the feeble pulse of the heart as wanting the succor of respiration shortens also the course of this remaining blood she pushes it through the famous canal of communication called also the canal botel which joins the artery and vein of the lungs there is no more blood sent into the substance of the lungs than is necessary for their nourishment  without making the circuit of the lungs this second portion of blood is also sent into the left ventricle of the heart this engine armed with strong musculous fibers throws the blood through the aorta and it is productions to all parts of the body  as the blood returns to the placenta in the umbilicalartery it is absorbed by the epigastric vein and brought back to the heart of the mother in this manner the reciprocating circulation is continually carried it is by means of the forementioned canal of communication that some diverse having it still open can abide so long under water such people cannot easily be hanged the blood which upon straitening the aspera arteria to hinder respiration would regorge and extravase in the lungs retires to the heart by this abandoned passage to keep up a regular sistole and diastole in alternate contraction and relaxation of the ventricles of the heart by which the blood measured by the auricles is received and cast abroad to all parts of the body on this depends the natural life in losing the animal spirits and warmth of our blood we lose our lives gradually  death is an univeasal repose or cessation of motion  the second way of nourishment of the foetus we are not to omit that the inside of the uterus to which the placenta adheres is clothed with abundance of glands they continually strain from the blood a lacteous liquor this mixing again with the blood in the secundine is sucked up or pushed into the umbilicalvein so goes to the foetus  the third source of nourishment of the foetus the third source of nourishment of the foetus is remarkable it is the great quantity of nutritious juice in which the foetus floats in the chorion and amnios the tunicles or membranes our clothing in the womb this juice has a milky chylous taste it passes or is drawn through the nostrils down into the stomach and lessens in quantity as the foetus grows in bigness so that a the birth there is little or none left as to the objection that such a liquor has been found in the stomach of monsters who had no nose or mouth perhaps this might be only the salivo or sm th less considerable to sheath the menstrum of the stomach and the supposed meconio the mucus of the rectum where it is well known that the faeces receive their smell their color and consistence but i submit the solution of these preternatural cases to the judgment of the college  the raynoides or third membrane is not found in the human foetus for this does not urine we do not urine in the womb  the glandula renalis performs the office of the kidneys as this has no excretory or third canal doubtless the serum or urine is brought back with the blood in the emulgent vein  an essay on the parts of generation in women and on the law of formation the preexistence of the lineaments in the ovum the preexistence of lineaments in the ovum is the only hypothesis on this subject reducible to the mechanical or geometrical principle in which alone is certainty though this is new yet being highly curious and instructive the greatest physicians and anatomists receive it readily i shall with a parallel example describe it in terms so easy and familiar chaste or seemly that without offense this with a little attention or instruction may in general be understood by the fair sex they will see with pleasure that this concerns them in a high degree childbearing women particularly  those of our profession who know most scruple not to conclude and report that all the generations of men were lodged in the loins of eve the name signifies mother and is meant the common mother  god made of one blood all nations of men  they compare the ovarium of a woman to a bunch of grapes twelve sixteen twenty or more in number in each of these ova or eggs the lines or lineaments of a male or female all of them according to the great fiat are already ready there in their turn as they become the nearest to what they call the trump the head or extremity of the tuba falopiani an apendage of the uterus the matrix or womb the eggs become receptive of the impression of the semen of the male in the amorous congress  in the height of the caress the transporting the rapturous influence of the spirits and of the ardent semen darting through the tuba dresses or distends the trump now like a hand this does embrace the ovun so that the volatile the essential or spiritous part of the semen penetrates warms fecunds enlivens and determines the egg to receive progressive nourishment from the circulating blood of the destinated mother  thus the conception claothed with it is proper membranes the chorion and the amnios our vesture in the womb and with the placenta or secundine all of them of the first formation growing too big to hang upon the ovarium wanting also sufficient nourishment does loosen and separate now the impregnated ovum is received by the trump and brought down through the pipe the second or counter use of this tube excepting one this is the most admirable piece of mechanism in anatomy   the inner orifice being shut the placenta cleaves to the uterus and becomes a new and greater source of nourishment from the blood of the epigastric artery of the mother   bilicalvein the navel string and goes to the conception thus by the recurrent vessels the blood does alternate to the mother  now the lines or lineaments of the conception begin to unfold and range by the increasing blood pushing  in this manner the conception becomes an embryo and this a foetus which by degrees growing to maturity and straitened for want of room the placenta also separating falling away like ripe fruit or leaves from a tree the infant seeks to dislodge bearing on the neck of the womb the weight raises the throws of labor  to prove what they here advance anatomists husk or skin the seed of a pine tree apple then holding it before the sun they show the top the trunk and the root of the tree which it was to produce  this they take as a demonstration of their hypothesis of the preexistence of lineaments in the ovum on the plea that the law of formation is general  whiston believes that generation is nothing but nutrition or augmentation of the parts so it is the ovum being impregnated as aforesaid becomes susceptible of nutrition and growth  this subject will be improved in relation to the double conception and the parted ovarium  in the two foregoing essays women will see with singular satisfaction the time and manner of their conception and all the alterations and accidents which do or may happen to them till their delivery seeing that by means of the placenta the child does only stick or cling to the womb this may separate or part by a fall or other violence perceiving the danger ladies will naturally form to themselves a regimen or manner of living to prevent abortion or miscarriage  they will no longer believe the imposed absurdity of bringing a son or a daughter at their wish or desire  these things will be easily understood and give no little pleasure in reading them  of bleeding from the observation which i have made on many peoples arms and the great accidents which happen often it is evident that the danger in bleeding is little understood few know how to shun it you shall learn to bleed easy and be made absolutely safe in all cases  was the use of the curvecatheter generally known and practiced it would in a great measure set aside the cruel operation of cutting for the stone having recourse to this instrument few would expose to so doubtful an event  the reverend mr john richardson preceptor to baptist noel earl of gainsborough was for many years almost incessantly tormented with a suppression of urine and strangury from a stone in the bladder sometimes he has staggered about the room with convulsive pain  the first time that i introducted my curvecatheter he urined through this instrument and the pain did remit next day i turned a second time the ragged stone on the smooth part and his pain and provocation went off excepting some short fits of pain and strangury he urined regularly for three months
