men who have left monuments of their martial glory in every country your grace it is hoped will with pleasure here recognize the noble ardour your example lately tended to revive by raising and commanding in person a military force in defense of your country at a period when her natives had not discernment to perceive nor spirit to assume the privileges of british subjects  the second volume

tradition of poetry and on the tragic ballad dissertation i on the oral tradition of poetry it has long been a subject of regret that the inventors of the fine arts have by oblivion been deprived of the reputation due to their memory of the many realms which lay claim to their birth egypt seems to possess the preference yet like the nile which animates that country while they have diffused pleasure and utility over kingdoms their origin remains hid in the most profound obscurity  that poetry holds a distinguished superiority over all these sciences is allowed yet the first practiser of this enchanting art has lost the renown it was designed to confer we must either allow the contested claim of the osiris of the egyptians and apollo of the greeks or be content to withhold from any the fame which indeed seems due to as many inventors as there are distinct nations in the world for poetry appears not to require the labor of disquisition or aid of chance to invent but is rather the original language of men in an infant state of society in all countries it is the effusion of fancy actuated by the passions and that these are always strongest when uncontrouled by custom and the manners which in an advanced community are termed polite is evident but the peculiar advantages which a certain situation of extrinsic objects confers on this art have already been so well illustrated by eminent critics particularly dr blackwell in his enquiry into the life and writings of homer and dr blair in his elegant dissertation on the poems of ossian  that it is unnecessary here to remember them i have besides noted a few such as immediately concern the compositions now under view in the subsequent dissertation and only propose here to give a brief account of the utility of the oral tradition of poetry in that barbarous state of society which necessarily precedes the invention of letters and of the circumstances that conspired to render it easy and safe  among the egyptians probably the most ancient authors of the elegant as well as useful sciences we find that verses were originally used solely to preserve the laws of their princes and sayings of their wise men from oblivion herodot diodor sicul etc  these were sometimes inscribed in their temples in their hieroglyphic character but more frequently only committed to the memory of the expounders of their law or disciples of their sages pythagoras who was initiated in their secret science conveyed in like manner his dictates to his disciples as appears from the moral verses which pass under his name at this day and though the authenticity of these may be questioned yet that he followed this mode of bequeathing his knowledge to his followers is proved from the consent of all antiquity jamblichus de vita pythag passim and particularly lib i cap    and     nay before him thales composed in like manner his system of natural philosophy and even so late as the time of aristotle the laws of the agathyrsi a nation in sarmatia were all delivered in verse not to mention the known laws of the twelve tables which from the fragments still remaining of them appear to have consisted of short rythmic sentences  from laws and religion poetry made an easy progress to the celebration of the gods and heroes who were their founders verses in their praise were sung on solemn occasions by the composers or bards themselves we meet with many before homer who distinguished themselves by such productions fabricius in bibliotheca graeca tom i has enumerated near seventy whose names have reached our times that immortal author had the advantage of hearing their poems repeated and was certainly indebted to his predecessors for many beauties which we admire as original that he was himself an aoidos or minstrel and sung his own verses to the lyre is shown by the admirable author of the enquiry into his life and writings sect viii  nor were his poems rescued from the uncertain fame of tradition and committed to writing till some time after his death aelian var hist lib xiii c      such was the utility of the poetic tradition among the more polished nations of antiquity and with those they denominated barbarians we find it no less practiced the reader who would desire more intelligence on this head may consult a curious dissertation on the monuments which supplied the defect of writing among the first historians by the abbe ansesm in les memoires de lacademie des inscriptions etc  the persians had their magi who preserved as would seem in this way the remarkable events of former times and in war went before the army singing the praises of their illustrious men whom the extraordinary gratitude and admiration of their countrymen had exalted into deities if they gained the victory the song of triumph recorded the deeds of those who had fallen and by their praises animated the ambition of those who enjoyed the conquest to farther acts of valor the latter custom was in use still more anciently among the jews as appears from the songs of moses exodus xv and deborah judges v preserved in sacred writ  the druids of gaul and britain afford a noted instance et bardi quidem fortia

verse the brave actions of their ancestors were always sung as an incentive to their imitation before they entered into combat the like we read of the ancient goths jornand see wartons hist of english poetry  those destroyers of all literature who yet possessed greater skill in the fine arts than is commonly ascribed to them from them this custom passed to their descendants the inhabitants of the northern regions many animated specimens of whose traditional poetry have been preserved to our times see the histories of saxo grammat jo magnus torfaeus etc passim and dr percys five pieces of runic poetry and quoted by their modern historians as uncontrollable vouchers as the arabian historians refer for the truth of many events to the spanish romanzes saved in like manner by tradition for many

poems of voiture the spanish word romanze seems now applied to any short lyric tale on whatever subject we find in gongora their most eminent poet romances amorosos y burlescos  traditional verses are

spirit and character of their effusions like them they composed amorous verses with delicacy and nature but when they attempted the sublimer walk of the heroic song their imagination was often bewildered and they wandered into the contiguous regions of the incredible and absurd huet ubi supra p lxx ermengarde vicomtesse de narbonne  laccueil favorable quelle fit aux poets provenceaux a fait

oral tradition disappeared the venerable british bards were in time succeeded by the welsh beirdh history of wales by caradoc of lhancarvan etc   0  p      whose principal occupation seems to have been to preserve the genealogy of their patrons or at times to amuse them with some fabulous story of their predecessors sung to the harp or crowd this is the instrument meant in the following verses

an instrument which griffith ap conan king of wales is said to have brought from ireland about the beginning of the twelfth century  in like manner among the caledonians as an ingenious writer mr macpherson in his dissertation on the era of ossian p     ed      acquaints us every chief in process of time had a bard in his family and the office became hereditary by the succession of these bards the poems concerning the ancestors of the family were handed down from generation to generation they were repeated to the whole clan on solemn occasions and always alluded to in the new compositions of the bards the successors of ossian were at length employed chiefly in the mean office of preserving fabulous genealogies and flattering the pride of their chieftains at the expense of truth without even fancy sufficient to render their inventions either pleasing or plausible that order of men i believe is now altogether extinct yet they have left a spirit of poetry in the country where they flourished see martins and other descriptions of the western isles passim  and ossians harp still yields a dying sound among the wilds of morven  having thus given a faint view of the progress of the oral tradition of poetry to these times for an account of the more modern minstrels see dr percys dissertation which is so complete that it leaves nothing to add  i proceed to show what arts the ancient bards employed to make their verses take such hold of the memory of their countrymen as to be transmitted safe and entire without the aid of writing for many ages these may be considered as affecting the passions and the ear their mode of expression was simple and genuine they of consequence touched the passions truly and effectively and when the passions are engaged we listen with avidity to the tale that so agreeably affects them and remember it again with the most prompt facility this may be observed in children who will forget no circumstance of an interesting story more especially if striking or dreadful to the fancy when they cannot remember a short maxim which only occupies the judgment the passions of men have been and will be the same through all ages poetry is the sovereign of the passions and will reign while they exist we may laugh at sir isaac newton as we have at descartes but we shall always admire a homer an ossian or a shakspere  as the subjects of these genuine painters of nature deeply interested the heart and by that means were so agreeable and affecting that every hearer wished to remember them so their mode of constructing their verse was such that the remembrance was easy and expeditious a few of their many arts to aid the memory i shall here enumerate  i most of these oral poems were set to music as would appear by the original authors themselves that this was the custom so early as the days of homer may be seen in the excellent author formerly adduced enquiry etc sect viii  how should we have been affected by hearing a composition of homer or ossian ung and played by these immortal masters themselves with the poem the air seems to have passed from one age to another but as no musical compositions of the greeks exist we are quite in the dark as to the nature of these i suppose that ossians poetry is still recited to its original cadence and to appropriated tunes we find in an excellent modern writer mr warton in his history of english poetry  that this mode of singing poetry to the harp was reckoned an accomplishment so late as among the saxon ecclesiastics the ancient music was confessedly infinitely superior to ours in the command of the passions nay the music of the most barbarous countries has had effects that not all the sublime pathos of corelli or animated strains of handel could produce have not the welsh irish and scottish tunes greater influence over the most informed mind at this day than the best italian concerto what modern refined music could have the powers of the rance de vaches see rousseau dict de music sur cette article though the swiss are a brave nation yet their dance which corresponds to the rance des vaches is like their others rather expressive of an

melancholy sound of the indian bansha see graingers prosopoetic account of the culture of the sugarcane book iv  is not the warmusic of the rudest inhabitants of the wilds of america or scotland more terrible to the ear than that of the best band in the british army or what is still more surprising will not the softer passions be more inflamed by a turkish air than by the most exquisite effort of a polite composer as we learn from an elegant writer letters of lady m w montague xxxiii  whom concurring circumstances rendered the best judge that could be imagined of that subject the harmony therefore of the old traditional songs possessing such influence over the passions at the same time that it rendered every expression necessary to the ear must have greatly recommended them to the remembrance  ii besides musical cadence many arts were used in the versification to facilitate the rehearsal such were    the frequent returns of the same sentences and descriptions expressed in the very same words as for instance the delivery of messages the description of battles etc of which we meet with infinite examples in homer and some if i mistake not in ossian good ones may be found in hardyknute part i v     etc compared with part ii v  0  etc and in child maurice v    with v    and innumerable such in the ancient traditional poetry of all nations these served as land marks in the view of which the memory traveled secure over the intervening spaces on this head falls likewise to be mentioned what we call the burden that is the unvaried repetition of one or more lines fixing the tone of the poem throughout the whole that this is very ancient among the barbaric nations may be gathered from the known song of regner lodbrog to be found in olaus wormius regner lodbrog king of denmark flourished in the ninth century  every stanza of which begins with one and the same line so many of our ballads both ancient and modern have this aid to the memory that it is unnecessary to condescend on any in particular    alliteration was before the invention of rhyme greatly used chiefly by the nations of northern original to assist the remembrance of their traditional poetry most of the runic methods of versification consisted in this practice it was the only one among the saxon poets from whom it passed to the english and scottish see hickes ling vet sept these c    from the saxons he observes that the author of pierce plowman drew this practice c    this poem was written about    0 there is a remarkable similarity in its style and manner with those very curious pieces of ancient scottish poetry styled the prophecies of thomas rymer mavelous merling beid berlington waldhave eltraine banister and sybilla printed at edinburgh in      and reprinted from that edition       vo it is very surprising that the respectable editor of ancient scottish poems from the ms of george bannatyne      edin    0 seems to regard these as not more ancient than the time of queen mary his reasons are only founded on the modern appearance of some particular passages that they have been modernized and corrupted i will readily allow but that they are on the main nearly as ancient as rymers time who died about the beginning of the   th century i believe the learned must confess from intrinsic evidence in such cases the surest of all not to mention that sir david lindsay who wrote in the reign of james v is an undoubted witness that they must be more ancient than this eminent antiquary would infer for in enumerating the methods he took to divert that prince while under his care in his infancy after condescending on some risible circumstances as when thou wast young i bare thee in my arm full tenderly till thou began to gang and in thy bed often happed thee full warm with lute in hand than sweetly to thee sang sometime in dancing fiercefully i flang and sometimes playing fairses on the flure and sometimes of mine office taking cure and sometimes like a feind transfigurate and sometimes like a greesy ghost of gay in diverse forms often times disfigurate etc   he adds the prophesies of rymer bid and merlin and many other pleasant history of the red erin and gyre carlin comforting thee when that i saw thee sorry episile to the king prefixed to his dream  they begin thus merling says in his book who will read right althouch his sayings be uncouth they shall be true found in the seventh chapter read who so will one thousand and more after christs birth then the chalnalider of cornwall is called and the wolf out of wales is vanquished for aye then many ferlies shall fall and many folk shall die   this exordium is evidently retouched by a modern hand  but very many of the passages seem to stand in their original form as the following lines which are all in the saxon manner will testify and derfly dung down without any doom  a proud prince in the preis lordly shall light with bold barons in bushment to battle shall wend  there shall a galyart goat with a golden horn    and many similar that prophecy which bears the name of thomas rymer is not destitute of poetic graces it opens with the following lines still on my ways as i went out throuch a land beside a lee i met a bairn upon the bent modernized way though against the rhyme  methought him seemly for to see i asked him wholly his intent good sir if your will be since that ye bide upon the bent some uncouth tidings tell you me when shall all these wars be gone that leil men may live in lee or when shall fasehude go from home and lawtie blow his horn on hie i looked from me not a mile and saw two knights upon a lee etc   i imagine however they are all the composures of one hand and if i may use a conjecture were written immediately after the visions of pierce plowman every english poem of note in those days being soon succeeded by an imitation in scotland    when rhyme became common this which was before thought to constitute the sole difference between prose and verse was still regarded as an accessory grace and was carried to a ludicrous length by some poets of no mean rank in both nations so late as the reign of queen elizabeth we find the following lines in a court poet princes puffed barons blustered lords began lowr knights stormed squires startled like steeds in a stowr pages and yeomen yelled out in the hall king ryences challenge in the relics of ancient english poetry vol iii p       and william dunbar the chief of the old scottish poets begins a copy of verses to the king thus sanct salvator send silver sorrow bannatynes scottish poems p     i asked him wholly his intent good sir if your will be since that ye bide upon the bent some uncouth tidings tell you me when shall all these wars be gone that leil men may live in lee or when shall fasehude go from home and lawtie blow his horn on hie i looked from me not a mile and saw two knights upon a lee etc   i imagine however they are all the composures of one hand and if i may use a conjecture were written immediately after the visions of pierce plowman every english poem of note in those days being soon succeeded by an imitation in scotland  iii but the greatest assistance that could be found to the tradition of poetry was derived from the invention of rhyme which is far more ancient than is commonly believed one of the most learned men this age has produced le clerc biolioth universelle tom ix  has shown that it is common in scripture all the psalms consist of riming verses and many other passages which he names they were used among the greeks so early as the time of gorgias the sicilian who taught the athenians this practice and though the spirit of the greek and latin languages did not always admit of them in poetry yet they were used as occasional beauties by their most celebrated writers homer hesiod and virgil have a few though apparently more from chance than design the ancient saturnine verses were all rimes as an old commentator servius ad georg ii ver     informs us and it is more than probable they were so constructed merely that the memory might the more easily preserve them their license forbidding their being committed to writing those who would wish to know more particularly the universality of this mode of versifying among the other ancient nations may consult the huetiana of the most learned and respectable bishop of avranches sect     the eastern poetry consists altogether if i mistake not of riming lines as may be observed in the specimens of hafiz their most illustrious writer lately published jones comment poeseos asiaticae  richardsons specimen of persian poetry  it appears however that alliteration supplied the place of rhyme with the northern nations till within a recent period ol worm lit run p     and      ossians poetry i suppose is in stanzas something like our ballad measure though it were to be wished the translator had favored us with some information on this head evidenced by specimens of the original he indeed acquaints us that each verse was so connected with those which preceded or followed it that if one line had been remembered in a stanza it was almost impossible to forget the rest dissert on the era of ossian p     ed       but this stands greatly in need of explanation  the common ballad stanza is so simple that it has been used by most nations as the first mode of constructing rimes the spanish romanzes bear a great resemblance in this as in other respects to the scottish ballads in both every alternate line ends with similar vowels though the consonants are not so strictly attended to as for instance in the former we have bana espada mala palabra vega cueva rompan volcanos for rimes and in the later mdale girdle keep bleed buleighan tak him etc the english even in the ruder pieces of their first minstrels seem to have paid more attention to the correspondence of their consonants as may be observed in the curious collection published by dr percy  as the simplicity of this stanza rendered it easy to the composer and likewise more natural to express the passions so it added to the facility of recollection it is tone is sedate and slow the rimes occur seldom and at equal distances though when a more violent passion is to be painted by doubling the rimes they at once expressed the mind better and diversified the harmony of this the reader will observe many instances in this collection as here maun i lie here maun i die like beacon bricht at deid of nicht na river heir my dame  deir etc and to give a very solemn movement to the cadence they sometimes tripled the rhyme an instance of which may be observed in the first stanza of child maurice  when all the circumstances here hinted at are considered we shall be less apt to wonder that by the concurrence of musical air retentive arts in the composition and chiefly of rhyme the most noble productions of former periods have been preserved in the memory of a succession of admirers and have had the good fortune to arrive at our times pure and uncorrupted  dissertation ii on the tragic ballad that species of poetry which we denominate ballad is peculiar to a barbarous period in an advanced state of arts the comic ballad assumes the form of the song or sonnet and the tragic or heroic ballad that of the higher ode  the cause of our pleasure in seeing a mournful event represented or hearing it described has been attempted to be explained by many critics aristotle scaliger dubos trapp in his praelections hume essay on tragedy but above all mr burke in his enquiry into the sublime and beautiful  it seems to arise from the mingled passions of admiration of the art of the author curiosity to attend the termination delight arising from a reflection on our own security and the sympathetic spirit  in giving this pleasure perhaps the tragic ballad yields to no effort of human genius when we peruse a polished tragedy or ode we admire the art of the author and are led to praise the invention but when we read an unartful description of a melancholy event our passions are more intensely moved the labored productions of the informed composer resemble a greek or roman temple when we enter it we admire the art of the builder the rude effusions of the gothic muse are like the monuments of their architecture we are filled with a religious reverence and forgetting our praise of the contriver adore the present deity  i believe no tragic ballad of renowned antiquity has reached our times if we deny the beautiful and pathetic carmen de aty in catullus a title to this class which as a modern critic of note has observed essay on the writings and genius of pope p      d ed  seems a translation from some greek dithyrambic the dithyrambics were heroic songs written with the highest glow of poetic fancy in honor of the ancient deities aristotle informs us that the greek tragedy originated from them as their comedy did from their pastoral love songs  far more ancient than the times of that poet his translation of sapphos ode might show that he took a delight in the ancient greek compositions from which indeed he seems to have derived in a great measure his peculiarly delicate vein  but it was with the nations in a state of barbarity that this effusion of the heart flourished as in it is proper soil their societies rude and irregular were full of vicissitudes and every hour subject to the most dreadful accidents the ministrels who only knew and were inspired by the present manners caught the tale of mortality and recorded it for the instruction and entertainment of others it pleased by moving the passions and at the same time afforded caution to their auditors to guard against similar misadventures  it is amusing to observe how expressive the poetry of every country is of its real manners that of the northern nations is ferocious to the highest degree nor need we wonder that those whose laws obliged them to decide the most trifling debate with the sword frotho etiam iii danorum rex quemadmodum saxo lib v refert de qualibet controversia far decerni sanxit speciosius viribus quam verbis confligendum existimans schedius de diis ger sing ii c     delighted in a vein of poetry which only painted deeds of blood and objects horrible to the imagination the ballad poetry of the spaniards is tinged with the romantic gallantry of the nation the hero is all complaisance and takes off his helmet in the heat of combat when he thinks on his mistress that of the english is generous and brave in their most noble ballad percy laments over the death of his mortal foe that of the scots is perhaps like the face of their country more various than the rest we find in it the bravery of the english the gallantry of the spanish and i am afraid in some instances the ferocity of the northern  a late writer miscellanies by john armstrong md vol ii p     has remarked that the scottish tunes whether melancholy or gay whether amorous martial or pastoral are in a style highly original and most feelingly expressive of all the passions from the sweetest to the most terrible he proceeds who was it that threw out those dreadful wild expressions of distraction and melancholy in lady culrosss dream an old composition now i am afraid lost perhaps because it was almost too terrible for the ear  this composition is neither lost nor is it too terrible for the ear on the contrary a child might hear it repeated in a winter night without the smallest emotion a copy it is entitled a godly dream compiled by elizabeth melvil lady culross younger at the request of a friend edinburgh        mo p  0 it is either reprinted from some former edition or from a ms it was written i conjecture about the end of the sixteenth century but in this edition i suspect several expressions are modernized and altered to accommodate it to the common capacity  the lady culross here meant was elizabeth daughter of sir james melvil of halhill and wife of john colvil commendator of culross she is believed to have been the mother of samuel colvil the satirical poet author of the scots hudibras etc   of it now lies before me and as some curiosity may have been raised by the above remark i shall here give an account of it the dreadful and melancholy of this production are solely of the religious kind and may have been deeply affecting to the enthusiastic at the period in which it was written it begins thus upon a day as i did mourn full sore for sundry things wherewith my soul was grieved my grief increased and grew more and more i comfort fled and could not be relieved with heaviness my heart was sore mischieved i loathed my life i could not eat nor drink i might not speak nor look to none that lived but mused alone and diverse things did think this wretched world did so molest my mind i thought upon this false and iron age and how our hearts are so to vice inclined that satan seems most fearfully to rage nothing on earth my sorrow could aswage i felt my sin so strongly to increase i grieved the spirit was wont to be my pledge my soul was plunged into most deep distress   her savior is then supposed to appear in a dream and lead her through many hairbreadth scapes into heaven through dreadful dens which made my heart aghast he bare me up when i began to tire sometimes we clamb oer cragie mountains high and sometimes stayed on ugly braes of sand they were so stay that wonder was to see but when i feared he held me by the hand  through great deserts we wandered on our way  forward we past on narrow bridge of tree oer waters great which hideously did roar and   the most terrible passage to a superstitious ear is that in which she supposes herself suspended over the gulf of perdition ere i was ware one gripped me at last and held me high above a flaming fire the fire was great the heat did pierce me sore my faith grew weak my grip was very small i trembled fast my fear grew more and more my hands did shake that i held him withal at length they loosed then i began to fall etc   at length she arrives in view of the heavenly mansions in a stanza which to alter a little her own expression glisters with tinsel  i looked up unto that castle fair glistering with gold and shining silver bright the stately towers did mount above the air they blinded me they cast so great a light my heart was glad to see that joyful sight my voyage then i thought it not in vain i him besought to guide me there aright with many vows never to tire again and the whole concludes with an exhortation to a pious life  but what has the christian religion to do with poetry in the true poetic terrible i believe some passages in hardyknute yield to no attempt of a strong and dark fancy the ballad styled edward may i fear be rather adduced as an evidence that this displeases when it rises to a degree of the horrible which that singular piece certainly partakes of  the pathetic is the other principal walk of the tragic muse and in this the scottish ballads yield to no compositions whatever what can be imagined more moving than the catastrophes of ossians darthula the most pathetic of all poems or of hardyknute child maurice and indeed most of the pieces now collected were ever the feelings of a fond mother expressed in a language equal in simplicity and pathos to that of lady bothwell  this leads me to remark that the dialect in which the scottish ballads are written gives them a great advantage in point of touching the passions their language is rough and unpolished and seems to flow immediately from the heart   we meet with no concettos or farfetched thoughts in them they possess the pathetic power in the highest degree because they do not affect it and are striking because they do not meditate to strike  most of the compositions now offered to the public have already received approbation the mutilated fragment of hardyknute formerly in print was admired and celebrated by the best critics as it is now i am inclined to think given in it is original perfection it is certainly the most noble production in this style that ever appeared in the world the manners and characters are strongly marked and well preserved the incidents deeply interesting and the catastrophe new and affecting i am indebted for most of the stanzas now recovered to the memory of a lady in lanarkshire  a modern lyric poet of the first class mr gray see his letters published by mr mason sect iv let xxv has pronounced child maurice a divine ballad aristotles best rules says he are observed in it in a manner that shows the author had never read aristotle indeed if any one will peruse aristotles art of poetry with daciers elucidations and afterward compare their most approved rules with this simple ballad he will find that they are better illustrated by this rude effort of the gothic muse than by the most exquisite tragedy of ancient or modern times the oedipus tyrannus of sophocles the athalie of racine the merope of maffei and even the very excellent drama which seems immediately founded on it not excepted there being many delicate strokes in this original which the plot adopted by that author forbade his making proper use of this does honor at once to the unknown composer of this ballad and to the first of critics in the former the reader will admire a genius that probably untracked by erudition could produce a story corresponding to the intricate though natural rules of the greek author to the latter will be readily confirmed the applause of an ancient apud suidam  that he was the secretary of nature and his pen was ever dipped in good sense  these and the other monuments of ancient scottish poetry which have already appeared are in this edition given much more correct and a few are now first published from tradition the editor imagined they possessed some small beauties else they would not have been added to this selection their seeming antiquity was only regarded as it enhanced their real graces  mdcclxxvi  these dissertations etc were written of this date but slight additions have been made to them from time to time as the reader will observe from references to books published since that period   having in the first of the foregoing dissertations mentioned with applause the spanish ballads or romanzes contained in the historia de las guerras civiles de granada and that book being seldom to be met with and written in a language of no wide study the editor has been induced to give a few translations from that work the two which dr percy has published having rather excited than gratified curiosity  before producing these translations it may be proper to give some short account of the work whence they are taken the history of the civil wars of granada is a wellwritten narration of those dissentions which tore that kingdom in pieces for some years before the period that ferdinand and isabella king and queen of christian spain conquered it down to the time of conquest the chief sources of those dissentions were the two great vandos or factions of the zegris and the abencerrages whose exploits and adventures with those of their adherents are here displayed with a minute detail that savours very strongly of romance though the great outlines of the work are evidently founded on historical truth which if the reader pleases is indeed only another name for a certain species of romance  this history as we learn from the work itself toward the close is a translation from the arabic of an anonymous moor who fled to africa with many of his countrymen when granada was yielded to the arms of ferdinand his grandson by name argutaafa found this work among his grandfathers papers and presented it to a jew called rabbi santo who translated it into hebrew and gave the arabic original to don rodrigo ponce de leon conde de baylen that lord being interested by it as his ancestors had been concerned in the wars there related ordered the jew to translate it into castillan spanish and afterward gave the translation to the spanish editor whose name from the first edition barcelona printed by seb matevad    0 appears to be ginez perez  on almost every occasion the author produces some romanze as the voucher of his incidents translations of a few of which shall now be produced it must however be premised that the first translation is merely meant to convey to the reader an idea of the verse in which most of the originals are written for which purpose one of the feeblest was chosen as had strength of thought or incident been attempted in this way the spirit would have totally evaporated in the midst of attention to the double rimes of which the english language is remarkably penurious  romanze i i at the pleasant dawn of

the graceful knight so strongly threw it was anciently the custom for the spanish gentry to amuse themselves while on horseback with throwing small rods or canes into the air on darting of which with

hill the morn in rosy radiance shines iii swift from his steed the warrior lights and kneels upon the ground as struck with awe such power has love the valiant to confound o fair he cries with trembling voice this day must fame be mine what chance can hurt me now that i have seen thy charms divine iv yet of thy favor i beseech some badge to bear along it was the custom for ladies to present their lovers with the penon or fireamer they were to wear on their lance in combat or turney the penon was commonly richly inwoven with the ladys cipher see stanza xiii  that with it graced my haughty

nights nor joy thy days adorn xiii at zambra a moresque dance  nor at festival may never knight appear thy cipher on embroidered sleeve or silken badge to bear may jealousy even of his age thy peace still violate may he live long thy fiercest foe can wish no worse a fate xiv thus as he spoke the gradual night descended all around and as he near the mansion drew of mirth he heard the sound sudden

stood the priest to fix the sacred band this cruel sight when gazul saw his madness found new flame a while he rested till at hand the brilliant troop now came xvi then spurred his steed into the

though used in the latter sense by the english yet the scots still take it in its first acceptance the names in cunningham says sir david dalrymple are all saxon as is the name of the country itself annals of scotland an    0 note the danish and saxon are both derived from the old gothic and were so similar that a person of the one nation might understand one of the other speaking in his proper tongue from the names and whole tenor of this poem i am inclined to think the chief scene is laid in cunninghamshire where likewise the battle of largs supposed to be that so nobly described in the first part was fought  ver   britons this was the common name which the scots gave the english anciently as may be observed in their old poets and particularly blind harry whose testimony indeed can only be relied on as to the common language and manners of his time his life of wallace being a tissue of the most absurd fables ever mingled  v   hie on a bill etc this necessary caution in those times when strength was the only protection from violence is well painted by a contemporary french bard un chasteau scay sur roche espouvantable en lieu venteux la rive perilleuse la vy tyrant seant a haute table en grand palais en sal plantureuse etc d alliac eveque de cambray  v    knicht these knights were only military officers attending the earls barons etc as appears from the histories of the middle ages see seldom tit hon p ii c   the name is of saxon origin and of remote antiquity as is proved by the following fragment of a poem on the spanish expedition of charles the great written at

catholic and christian religion presently professed at all my power  i shall be loyal and true to my sovereign lord the king his majesty and do honor and reverence to all orders of chevalrie and to the uoble office of arms  i shall fortify and defend justice to the uttermost of my power but feid or favor  i shall never fly from the kings majesty my lord and master or his lieutenant in time of

orphans and maids of good fame  i shall do diligence wherever i hear tell there are any traitors murderers rievers and masterful thieves and outlaws that suppress the poor to bring them to the law at all my power  i shall maintain aed defend the noble and gallant state of chevalrie with horses harneses and other knichtly apparel to my power  i shall be diligent to enquire and seek to have the knowledge of all points and articles touching or concerning my duty contained in the book of chevalry  all and sundry the premises i oblige me to keep and fulfill so help me god by my own hand and by god himself  a curious account of the rise and progress of knighthood and its influence on society may be found in a learned and ingenious work lately published by dr stuart entitled a view of society in europe or enquiries concerning the history of law government and manners  v    emergard in the common copies it is elenor and indeed in all the recitals i have heard but in a late edition published with other scottish songs at edinburgh      it is rightly read as here emergard or ermengarde was daughter of the viscount of beaumont and wife of william the lion she died in      as the name was uncommon and of difficult pronunciation the rehearsers seem to have altered it to elenor which has none of these defects  the battle of largs supposed to be that meant in this poem was fought on the first of august      so that queen emergard was dead thirty years before yet this can amount to no error in chronology as the verses evidently imply that the lady of hardyknute had no equal in the kingdom for beauty save the queen in the prime of the youth and beauty of both which might well be forty years or more before the period of action in the poem  v    fairly this name seems likewise of saxon origin there is a small island and a rivulet in cunningham still called fairly isle and fairly burn  v    twenty thousand glittering speirs etc this agrees with buchanans account acho  viginti millia militum exposuit lib   torfaeus asserts this number of the norwegians was left dead on the field but upon what authority i know not as the ancient relations of the battle of largs support not his testimony see johnstones translation of hacos expedition to scotland in the year      from the plateyan and frisian mss printed at copenhagen       v    page the pages in the periods of chivalry

westmorelands ferce heir heir in the old scottish acceptance seems derived from the latin herus and signifies not apparent successor but present lord as in the following lines of blind harry of southampton he hecht both heir and lord b   c   of gloucester the huge lord and heir b    c   and in this of dunbar befoir mahoun the heir of hell  v  0       this minute description might lead us to suspect that a female hand had some part in this composition but before our minstrel homer has shown himself an adept in the ladys dress to the curious remarks on the variation of the british habit given us by mr walpole in his anecdotes of painting and mr granger in his biographical history might be added the following notice from a reverend minister of the church of scotland about school the women got a custom of wearing few garments i myself have seen the young brisk ladies walking on the streets with masks on their faces and with one only thin petticoat and their smoke so thin that one would make a conscience of sweiring they were not naked miscellanies by mr john bell minister at gladsmuir ms pen edit title apparel  v     save that of fairly fair working at the needle etc was reckoned an honorable employment by the greatest ladies of those times margaret the queen of malcolm iii as we learn from her life written by turgot her confessor employed the leisure hours of her ladies in this manner see lord hales annals of scotland an  0    v     sir knicht the addition sir to the names of knights was in use before the age of edward i and is from sire which in old french signifies seignieur or lord though applicable to all knights it served properly to distinguish those of the order who were not barons dr stuart view of society etc notes on sect   chap ii p      v          the custom of the ladies tending the wounded knights was common in those romantic ages lydgate whose story is ancient but whose manners are those of his own times has an instance in the story of

by dr percy in the first volume of his relics when the king is informed that knight is sick he says fetch me down my daughter dear she is a leeche fulle fine v     0  v          this stanza is now first printed it is surprising it is omission was not marked in the fragment formerly published as without it the circumstance of the knights complaint is altogether foreign and vague the loss was attempted to be glossed over by many variations of the preceding four lines but the defect was palpable to the most inattentive peruser  v     lord chattan this is a very ancient and honorable scottish surname some genealogists derive them from the chatti an ancient german tribe but others with more probability from the gilchattan of ireland st chattan was one of the first scottish confessors to whom was dedicated the priory of ardchattan in lorn founded in    0 and some others through the kingdom the chief of the clan chattan dying in the reign of david i without male issue the clan assumed the ancestor of the mphersons for superior by which means the name appears to have been lost in that of mpherson see buchanans brief enquiry into the genealogy and present state of ancient scottish surnames glasgow        to p     we however find the clan chattan mentioned as late as    0 in the history of the feuds and conflicts of the clans published from a ms of the reign of james vi glasgow      where a macintosh is called their chief  v     though we learn from buchanans equiry etc that the clan chattan are said to have come into scotland long before the expulsion of the picts yet i do not find this pretty anecdote which is much in the spirit of homer has any foundation in history the empire of the picts was demolished by kenneth about four centuries before the apparent date of the events narrated in this poem  v     make orisons etc this is perfectly in the style of knighthood before they entered into combat they solemly invoked the aid of god their savior

playand pibrochs of the pibroch i cannot give a better account than in the words of an excellent author a pibroch is a species of tune peculiar i think to the highlands and western isles of scotland it is performed on a bagpipe and differs totally from all other music its rythm is so irregular and its notes especially in the quick movement so mixed and huddled together that a stranger finds it almost impossible to reconcile his ear to it so as to perceive its modulation some of these pibrochs being intended to represent a battle begin with a grave motion resembling a march then gradually

former editions many such are corrected in this impression from comparing different rehearsals and still more from conjecture when an ignorant person is desired to repeat a ballad and is at a loss for the original expression he naturally supplies it with whatever absurdity first occurs to him that will form a rhyme these the editor made not the smallest scruple to correct as he always imagined that common sense might have its use even in emendatory criticism  v  0  but on his forehead etc the circumstances in this description seem borrowed from those of different battles betwixt the kings of

such compositions ye dames of denmark even for you i feel who sadly sitting on the seabeat shore long look for lords that never shall return douglas act iii  i cannot conclude my observations upon the description here given of the battle without adding that though perhaps not the most sublime it is the most animated and interesting to be found in any poet it yields not to any in ossian for lively painting nor to any in homer for those little anecdotes and strokes of nature which are so deservedly admired in that master poetry and rhetoric says the author of an enquiry into the origin of our ideas of the sublime and beautiful do not succeed in exact description so well as painting does their business is to affect rather by sympathy than imitation to display rather the effect of things on the mind of the speaker or of others than to present a clear idea of the things themselves this is their most extensive province and that in which they succeed the best will he forgive me if i offer this rude scottish poem as an example sufficiently illustrative of this fine remark  v     loud and chill blew the westlin wind etc this storm is artfully raised by the magic of poetry to heighten the terrible which is soon carried to a degree not surpassed in any production ancient or modern it will recall to the reader the like artifice employed in the most sublime passage of tassos gierusalemme end of canto   and of homers iliad viii ver     of mr popes translation  v     seimd now as black as moruning weid it was anciently the custom on any mournful event to hang the castle gates with black

reached his castle gate his gate was hung with black relics vol iii p      hardyknute part ii i have given the stanzas now added the title of a second part though i had no authority from the recital the break formerly made here by accident seemed to call for this pause to the reader  v     penants these were small banners charged with the arms of the owner and sometimes borne over the helm of the ancient knight by his squire and as would seem even that of the prince earl or chief baron by his baneret see ver     the english word is penon and by his banner borne is his penon of gold full rich

people there say it was built by the pechts which is their common way of expressing the picts  v     his halbrik this term for a coat of mail occurs in blind harry it was properly used for one composed of small rings of steel which yielded to every motion of the warrior and was the same with the lorica hamata of the romans so picturesquely described by claudian conjuncta per artem flexilis

et non senza ragione i moderni padrini fanno spogliare i cavallieri che hanno da entrare in battaglia et iscuotere et diligentemente essaminare i loro panni etc many instances occur in the accounts of the civil wars of france and of the netherlands and more particularly in the very curious story of gowries conspiracy published by james vi at edinburgh   00  to his majesty having before his parting out of that town caused to search the said earl of gowries pockets in case any letters that might further the discovery of that conspiracy might be found therein but nothing was found in them but a little close parchment bag full of magical characters and words of enchantment wherein it seemed that he had put his confidence thinking himself never safe without them and therefore ever carried them about with him being also observed that while they were upon him his wound whereof he died bled not but incontinent after the taking of them away the blood gushed out in great abundance to the great admiration of all the beholders see likewise memoirs of the affairs of scotland by david moses edin      where this piece is reprinted verbatim master william rynd a servant of lord gowries deposition in the same volume p     has singular anecdotes with regard to these characters  v     fairy charm the word fairy seems to have been accepted by the ancient english and scottish poets for supernatural or enchanted so chaucer speaking of cambuscans horse it was of fairie as the people seemed squires tale p    v     it was the privilege of the knights to hide their faces with armor so that it was impossible to distinguish any one from another except by his blazon which seems at first to have been displayed over them but came at length to be painted on their shields whence coats of arms a villein was obliged to have his countenance uncovered in battle this circumstance attended to will save our wonder at hardyknutes not knowing draffan in the first part and draffans not perceiving malcolm here till his spear tore off his visor though rothiay knows draffan either from his wearing a blazon on his armor or from his face being uncovered in order to breathe from the combat  v     cheir ye my mirrie men etc it should have been remarked on the first appearance of this word p i v     that mirrie was anciently used in a very different sense from its present it signified honest true faithful but no where jovial king james vi in his daemonologie ms pen edit surely the difference vulgaire put betwixt them is verrie mirrie and in a manner true p  0 and again in p    many honest and mirrie men in like manner merlins prophecies are styled  mirrie words in that of beid proph of rymer etc  v     oh king of hevin this is a common appellation of the deity with the more ancient scottish poets by hevins king is the familiar oath of blind harries heroes  v     by my forberes saul swearing by the souls of their ancestors was another used mode in those times the greatest thought this oath most strong and honorable probably because it implied the souls of their forefathers were in heaven and as was then believed might lend them a supernatural aid if the intention of their oath was just and unblameable  v      now mind your aith etc this passage is obscure the meaning i apprehend is that draffan had before the combat exacted an oath of allan his baneret that he would slay him should the necessity of his affairs demand this sacrifice more willing to lose his own life than possibly to take that of his great antagonist he commands allan to fulfill his engagement which with all the heroic faith of those times he does without a pause the particular expression the shynand blade might lead us to imagine that it was thought impossible to pierce the supposed enchanted armor but with one particular weapon likeways perhaps charmed  v     icolm the nunnery at icolm or icolmkill was one of the most noted in scotland the nuns were of the order of augustine and wore a white gown and above it a rocket of fine linen spotiswoods account of the religious houses in scotland p  0  the ruins of this nunnery are still to be seen with many tombs of the princesses one of which bears the year  000 martins western islands p      i cannot conclude my remarks on this poem without wasting one on the story of mrs wardlaw that this lady may have indeed received a ms of it as mentioned in dr percys introductory note is highly probable many valuable mss prepared for the press have had a worse fate but that she was the author of this capital composition so fraught with science of ancient manners as the above notes testify i will no more credit than that the common people in lanarkshire who can repeat scraps of both the parts are the authors of the passages they rehearse that she did not refuse the name of being the original composer is a strange argument would not the first poet in europe think it added to his reputation if conjecture may be allowed where proof must ever be wanting i suspect if we assign the end of the fifteenth century as the date of the antique parts of this noble production we shall not greatly err though at the same time the language must convince us that many strokes have been bestowed by modern hands  since the first publication of this volume sir david dalrymple lord hales whose abilities have been so often and so successfully exerted in illustrating the antiquities of his country to the law and the literature of which he is so great an ornament has communicated to the editor some notices with regard to this poem of hardyknute which shall here be laid before the reader almost in his own words  the following are extracts of a letter written by sir john bruce of kinross to lord binning about the year       to perform my promise i send you a true copy of the manuscript i found some weeks ago in a vault at dumferline it is written on vellum in a fair gothic character but so much defaced by time as you will find that the tenth part is not legible  sir john transcribes some stanzas which he calls verses after l     p i he says here are four verses defaced and then he transcribes l      at l     he adds hiatus in ms and then he transcribes l     at l   0 he says here are ten verses stanzas so spoilt that i can only guess by the many proper names that they contain the order of battle of the scots army as they stood ranged under their different chieftains  in conclusion sir john says there is a vast deal more of it but all defaced  the reader is left to judge whether this story of the manuscript on vellum etc has most the appearance of a true narrative or of a jeu d esprit addressed to a familiar friend  lord hales has a copy of the original edition of hardyknute with ms alterations in the hand writing of dr john clerk physician in edinburgh at l    it has  brade thomas sir john bruce has bred malcolm at l    sir john bruces ms has walter instead of malcolm at l  0

this incomparable ballad though corrupted into gil morris by the nurses and old women from whose mouths it was originally published child seems to have been of equal importance with damoiseau see note on p i v    of hardyknute and applicable to a young nobleman when about the age of fifteen it occurs in shakspeares lear in the following line probably borrowed from some old romance or ballad child roland to the dark tower came act iii s    and in chaucers rhyme of sir topas child is evidently used to denote a young and noble knight many instances might likewise be brought from spenser for this signification  gil morris is only the northern pronunciation of the true name of this ballad gil about aberdeen etc still signifies child as it does in galic witness the name gilchrist the child of christ etc  v    he bent his bow archery was enjoined the scottish warrior at a very early age as appears from many special laws to that effect and particularly the following one of james i item that all men busk them to be archeres fra they be twelfe yeir of age and that in ilk ten pundis worth of land their be maid bowmarkis and specially neir to paroche kirkis quhairin upon haly days men may

such happy tenuity of phrase this exquisite composition is only rivalled by the merope of maffei the most finished tragedy in the world some lines fancifully interpolated by a modern and very inferior hand are here omitted  v     and slaided owr the strae the meaning is he went bastily over the rank grass  v     as the hip is o the stean this would appear the corruption of some nurse but taking it as it stands the simile though none of the most delicate has a parallel in the father of english poetry but he was chaste and no lechoure and sweet as is the bramble flower that bearethe the red hip chaucer sir topas  adam o gordon the genuine subject of this ballad has long remained in obscurity though it must have been noted to every peruser of crawfords memoirs  but to return to gordon viz sir adam gordon of auchindown brother to the earl of huntly as these two actions against forbes or to speak more properly against the rebels gained him a vast reputation  his next exploit was attended with an equal portion of infamy and he was as much decryed for this unlucky action though at the same time he had no immediate hand in the matter as for his former ones he had been applauded he had sent one captain ker with a party of foot to summon the castle of towie in the queens name the owner alexander forbes was not then at home and his lady confiding too much in her sex not only refused to surrender but gave ker very injurious language upon which unreasonably transported with fury he ordered his men to fire the castle and barbarously burnt the unfortunate gentlewoman with her whole family amounting to thirtyseven persons nor was he ever so much as cashiered for this inhuman action which made gordon share both in the scandal and the guilt an      p   0 edit   0   in this narrative is immediately perceived every leading circumstance in the ballad the captain car by which name it was distinguished in dr percys manuscript is evidently the ker of crawford the house of rodes i have corrected according to the truth of story towie of which name i find in gordon of stralochs map of aberdeenshire there were two gentlemens seats or castles in his time one upon the don and another upon the ythan the nearest seat to the latter is that of rothy which from wrong information may have originally stood in the ballad the mistake rising naturally from the vicinity of their situation and from this have been corrupted to rodes the courage of this lady as represented in the ballad was equalled by that of the famous countess of salisbury at the siege of roxborough and of ladies arundel and banks in the last civil wars of england see particularly the mercurius rusticus etc land      sections v and xi  v     freits this word signifies ill omens and sometimes as here

digest of such scottish tragic ballads as deserve preservation could not have been called complete  vi john faw was king of the gypsies in scotland in the reign of james iv who about the year

the lieges that none of them molest vex unquiet or trouble the said faw and his company in doing their lawful business within the realm and in their passing remaining or going forth of the same under

lament shall still thy chief contentment be to see me malcontent shall i narcissus like a flying shadow chase or like pygmalion love a stone crowned with a winning face no know my blind love now shall follow reasons eyes and as thy fairness made me fond thy temper make me wise my loyalty disdains to love a loveless dame the spirit still of cupids fire consists in mutual flame had thou but given one look or had thou given one smile or had thou lent but one poor sigh my sorrows to beguile my captive thoughts perchance had been redeemed from pain and these my mutinous discontents made friends with hope again but thou i know at length art careless of my good and would ambitiously embrew thy beauty in my blood a great disgrace to thee to me a monstrous wrong which time may teach thee to repent ere happily it be long but to prevent thy shame and to abridge my woe because thou can not love thy friend i will cease to love my foe song what means this strangeness now of late since time must truth approve this distance may consist with state it cannot stand with love it is either cunning or distrust that may such ways allow the first is base the last unjust let neither blemish you for if you mean to draw me on there needs not half this art and if you mean to have me gone you overact your part if kindness cross your wished content dismiss me with a frown i will give you all the love
