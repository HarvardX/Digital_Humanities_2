from no   little turnstile       price  twopence  preface the rights of infants was wrote in the latter end of the year      but paines agrarian justice coming to hand before it was published the following strictures by way of preface and appendix were added  at last mr pain has thought fit to own with the psalmist and with mr lock that god has given the earth to the children of men given it to mankind in common  this is a truth so indisputable and which i always thought of such vast importance for mankind universally to understand and acknowledge that i have indefatigably embraced every opportunity from my youth up to publish it together with the most consistent plan that i could form thereon  i am glad that mr pain has even though late made this acknowledgement because his celebrity will procure him many readers and greatly add both to the investigation of this great fundamental truth and of such philosophical superstructures as may be built on the same but as to the plan that lie has laid down in his agrarian justice where he first acknowledges this principle it does not appear to me to be in any measure just or satisfactory the principle is without doubt incomparably grand and the very first maxim in the law of nature and in the science of right and wrong and is fraught with all the blessings that can render mankind happy on earth but o dire disappointment behold mr pain instead of erecting on this rock of ages an everlasting temple of justice has erected an execrable fabric of compromissory expediency as if in good earnest intended for a swinish multitude  the poor beggarly slipends which he would have us to accept of in lieu of our lordly and just pretensions to the soil of our birth are so contemptible and insulting that i shall leave them to the scorn of every person conscious of the dignity of his nature not detaining the reader from the perusal of the following little tract on the rights of infants where men who dare contemplate their rights may see them pourtrayed boldly at full length  the more i contemplate human affairs the more i am convinced that a landed interest is incompatible with the happiness and independence of the world for as all the rivers run into the sea and yet the sea is not full so let there be ever so many sources of wealth let trade foreign and domestic open all their fluices yet will no other but the landed interest he ultimately the better  in whatever line of business or in whatever situation the public observe men thrive thither every one presses and in competition bid over each others head for the houses and shops on the lucky spo thereby raising the rents till the landlord gets the whole fat of their labors it is the same in respect to the farms for if a profitable market foreign or domestic spring up for the produce of the earth then farming will be the rage and every one will over bid another for farms till they can hardly live by them nay even abolish the tithes and the rents of the farms will immediately so advance that the whole advantage shall center in the landlords  thus all things work togethe for good to those who love god which seems to be fully accomplished in the landed interest who are the visible elect yes for theirs are all things whether the sta the government or the dignities the principalities or the powers all dominion is rooted and grounded in land and thence spring every kind of lordship which overtops and choaks all the shrubs and flowers of the forest but take away those tall those overbearing ariflocratic trees and then the lowly plants of the soil will have air will thrive and grow robust nevertheless take care you leave not any roots of those lordly plants in the earth for though cut down to the slump like nebuchaduezzar yet if any vestage of the system remain any fiber of the accursed roots though ever so small lie concealed in the soil they would sprout again and soon recover their pristine vigor to the overshadowing and destruction of all the undergrowth thus do philosophy and the purest philanthropy compel us to cradicate this baneful order from human society  whether my plan of enjoying mans rights which i have been publishing in different ways for more than twenty years be objectionable or no it is certain it has never been answered neither have i seen or heard of any arguments on the subject but what have only more effectually convinced me that no system can be more universally just even to those it seems most to militate against more easily established because it is the interest of every one not to oppose it nor of course more likely afterward to be more peaceful and permanent  if i am wrong let me be confuted and if i am not let mankind for their own sakes pay attention to what i say they ought at least to give me credit for my disinterestedness in this scheme for according to it i can have no private landed estate no tenants to work for me nor claim any privilege above my fellowcitizens wherefore before any be so ungenerous as to condemn me as presumptuous i hope they will heartily weigh my several arguments which they will find in the various little things i have published which are neither many nor dear and in the following rights of infants  tho spence london march   th      the rights of infants written in the latter end of the year      open thy mouth for the dumb prove xxxi   and pray what are the rights of infants cry the haughty aristocracy sneering and tossing up their noses  woman ask the shebears and every shemonster and they will tell you what the rights of every species of young are  they will tell you in resolute language and actions too that their rights extend to a full participation of the fruits of the earth they will tell you and vindicate it likewise by deeds that mothers have a right at the peril of all opposers to provide from the elements the proper nourishments of their young and seeing this shall we be asked what the rights of infants are as if they had no rights as if they were excrescences and abortions of nature as if they had not a right to the milk of our breasts nor we a right to any food to make milk of as if they had not a right to good nursing to cleanliness to comfortable clothing and lodging villains why do you ask that aggravating question have not the soxes holes and the birds of the air nests and shall the children of men have not where to lay their heads have brutemothers a right to eat grass and the food they like best to engender milk in their dugs for the nourishment of their young and shall the mothers of infants be denied such a right is not this earth our common also as well as it is the common of brutes may we not eat herbs berries or nuts as well as other creatures have we not a right to hunt and prowl for prey with shewolves and have we not a right to fish with sheotters or may we not dig coals or cut wood for fuel nay does nature provide a luxuriant and abundant feast for all her numerous tribes of animals except us as if sorrow were our portion alone and as if we and our helpless babes came into this world only to weep over each other   aristocracy sneering and is your sex also set up for pleaders of rights   woman yes molochs our sex were defenders of rights from the beginning and though men like other hebrutes sink calmly into apathy respecting their offspring you shall find nature as it never was so it never shall be extinguished in us you shall find that we not only know our rights but have spirit to assert them to the downfall of you and all tyrants and since it is so that the men like heasses suffer themselves to be laden with as many pair of panyers of rents tithes etc as your tender consciences please to lay upon them we even we the females will vindicate the rights of the species and throw you and all your panyers in the dirt   aristocracy so you wish to turn the cultivated world into a wilderness that you may eat wild fruits and game like indians   woman no sophists we do not want to be as indians but the natural fruits of the earth being the fruits of our undoubted common we have an indefensible right to and we will no longer be deprived of them without an equivalent   aristocracy do you not in lieu of those wild productions get bread and mutton and beef and garden stuff and all the refined productions and luxuries of art and labor what reason then have you to complain   woman are you serious would you really persuade us that we have no reason to complain would you make us believe that we receive these productions of art and culture as a fair compensation for the natural produce of our common which you deprive us of have we not to purchase these things before we enjoy them   aristocracy sure woman you do not expect the fruits of mens labors and ingenuity for nothing do not the farmers in the first place pay very high rents for their farms and in the next place are they not at great trouble and expense in tilling and manuring the ground and in breeding cattle and surely you cannot expect that there men will work and toil and lay out their money for you for nothing   woman and pray ladies and gentlemen who ever dreamt of hurting the farmers or taking their provisions for nothing except yourselves it is only the privileged orders and their humble imitators on the highway who have the impudence to deprive men of their labors for nothing no if it please your noblenesses and gentlenesses it is you and not the farmers that we have to reckon with and pray now your highnesses who is it that receive those rents which you speak of from the farmers   arist we to be sure we receive the rents   woman you to be sure who the dvl are you who gave you a right to receive the rents of our common   arist woman our fathers either sought for or purchased our estates   woman well confessed villains now out of your own mouths will i condemn you you wicked molocks and so you have the impudence to own yourselves the cursed brood of russians who by slaughter and oppression usurped the lordship and dominion of the earth to the exclusion and starvation of weeping infants and their poor mothers or at the best the purchasers of those illgot domains o worse than molochs now let the blood of the millions of innocent babes who have perished through your vile usurpations be upon your murderous heads you have deprived the mothers of natures gifts and farmed them out to farmers and pocketied the money as you audaciously confess yes villains you have treasured up the tears and groans of dumb helpless perishing dying infants o you bloody landed interest you band of robbers why do you call yourselves ladies and gentlemen why do you assume soft names you beasts of prey too well do your emblazoned arms and escutcheons witness the ferocity of your bloody and barbarous origin but soon shall those audacious gothic emblems of rapine cease to offend the eyes of an enlightened people and no more make an odious distinction between the spoilers and the spoiled but ladies and gentlemen is it necessary in order that we eat bread and mutton that the rents should be received by you might not the farmers as well pay their rents to us who are the natural and rightful proprietors if for the sake of cultivation we are content to give up to farmers our wild fruits our hunting grounds our fish and game our coalmines and our forests is it not equitable that we should have the rents in lieu thereof if not how can the farmers have the face to sell us again the produce of our own land  hear me ye oppressors ye who live sumptuously every day ye for whom the sun seems to shine and the seasons change ye for whom alone all human and brute creatures toil sighing but in vain for the crumbs which fall from your overcharged tables ye for whom alone the heavens drop fatness and the earth yields her increase hearken to me i say ye who are not satisfied with usurping all that nature can yield ye who are insatiable as the grave ye who would deprive every heart of joy but your own i say hearken to me your horrid tyranny your infanticide is at an end your grinding the faces of the poor and your drinking the blood of infants is at an end the groans of the prisons the groans of the camp and the groans of the cottage excited by your infernal policy are at an end and behold the whole earth breaks forth into singing at the new creation at the breaking of the iron rod of aristocratic sway and at the rising of the everlasting sun of righteousness  and did you really think my good gentlefolk that you were the pillars that upheld the universe did you think that we would never have the wit to do without you did you conceive that we should never be able to procure bread and beef and fuel without your agency ah my dear creatures the magic spell is broke your sorceries your witchcrafts your priestcrafts and all your juggling crafts are at an end and the meridian sun of liberty bursts forth upon the astonished world dispelling the accumulated mists of dreary ages and leaves us the glorious blue expanse of serene unclouded reason  well then since you have compelled since you have driven us through your cruel bondage to emancipate ourselves we will even try to do without you and deal with the honest farmers ourselves who will find no difference unless for the better between paying their rents to us and to you  and whereas we have found our husbands to their indelible shame woefully negligent and deficient about their own rights as well as those of their wives and infants we women mean to take up the business ourselves and let us see if any of our husbands dare hinder us wherefore you will find the business much more seriously and effectually managed in our hands than over it has been yet you may smile tyrants but you have juster cause to weep for as nature has implanted into the breasts of all mothers the most pure and unequivocal concern for their young which no bribes can buy nor threats annihilate be assured we will stand true to the interest of our babes and shame woe and destruction be to the pitiful varlet that dare obstruct us for their sakes we will no longer make brick without straw but will draw the produce of our estate if we deprive ourselves of our common in order that it may be cultivated we ourselves will have the price thereof that we may buy therewith as far as it will go the farmers produce and so far as our respective shares of the rent may be inadequate to the comfortable and elegant support of ourselves and infants so far will we cheerfully by our honest endeavors in our several callings make up the deficiency and tender life worth enjoying to labor for ourselves and infants we do not decline but we are sick of laboring for an insatiable aristocracy  to convince your highnesses that our plan is well digested i will lay it before you you will find it very simple but that is the sign of the greater perfection as i said before we women because the men are not to be depended on will appoint in every parish a committee of our own sex which we presume our gallant lockjawed spouses and paramours will at least for their own interest not oppose to receive the rents of the houses and lands already tenanted and also to let to the best bidders on seven years leases such farms and tenements as may from time to time become vacant out of those rents we can remit to government so much per pound according to the exigencies of the state in lieu of all taxes so that we may no longer have taxes nor taxgatherers out of these rents we shall rent pay all our builders and workmen that build or repair our houses pave cleanse or light our streets pay the salaries of our magistrates an other public officers and all this we women shall do quarterly without a bank or banknoter in ready money when the rents are  in that suffering neither state nor parish to run in debt and  to the overplus after ll public expenses are defrayed we shall  it farly and equally among all the living souls in the parish whether male or female married or single legitimate or illtmate from a day old to the extremest age making no distincon between the families of rich farmers and merchants who pay much rent for their extensive farms or premises and the families of poor laborers and mechanics who pay but little for their small apartments cottages and gardens but giving to the head of every family a full and equal share for every name under his roof  and whereas births and funerals and consequent sicknesses are attended with expense it seems requisite to allow at quarterday to the head of every family a full share for every child that may have been born in his house since the former quarterday though the infant may be then but a day old and also for every person who may have died since the former quarterday though the death should have happened but a day after it  this surplus which is to be dealt out again among the living souls in a parish every quarterday may be reasonably supposed to amount to full twothirds of the whole sum of rents collected but whatever it may amount to such share of the surplus rents is the imprescriptible right of every human being in civilized society as an equivalent for the natural materials of their common estate which by letting to rent for the sake of cultivation and improvement they are deprived of  wherefore now ladies and gentlemen you see the glorious work is done and the rights of the human species built on so broad and solid a basis that all your malice will not be able to prevail against them moreover when we begin with you we will make a full end of your power at once we will not impoliticly tamper with the lion and pluck out a ooth now and then as some propose to melt down your strength by degrees which would only irritate you to oppose us with all the power you had remaining no we will begin where we mean to end by depriving you instantaneously as by an elective shock of every species of revenue from lands which will universally and at once be given to the parishes to be disposed of by and for the use of the inhabitants as said before  but yet be not cast down my good ladies and gentlemen all this is done for the sake of system not revenge or retaliation for we wish not to reduce you to beggary as you do us for we will leave you all your moveable riches and wealth all your gold and silver your rich clothes and furniture your corn and cattle and every thing that does not appertain to the land as a fixture for these you know must come to the parish with our estates so that you see you will still be the richest part of the community and may by your cheerful acquiescence be much more happy then you are now under the existing unjust system of things but if by foolish and cked opposition you should compel us in our own defense to confiscate even your movables and perhaps also to cut you off then let your blood be upon your own heads for we shall he guiltless it will therefore be your interest and wisdom to submit peaceably and fraternize cheerfully with us as fellow  for instead of you then having the revenues of the counrty to carry on war against us as you have now the parishes will then have these revenues to carry on the war against you and as to your moveable property we are not afraid of it for it would soon melt away in supporting you in a state of hostility against the strength and standing revenues of the country unburthened with debis and pensions so prepare yourselves peaceably to acquiesce in the new system of things which is fast approaching and when you shall hear of the blessed decree being passed by the people that the laud is from that day forth parochial property join chorus with your glad fellow creatures and joyfully partake in the universal happiness   the golden age so famed by men of yore shall now be counted fabulous no more the tyrant lion like an ox shall feed and lisping infants shall tamed tigers lead with deadly asps shall sportive sucklings play nor ought obnoxious blight the blithesome day yes all that prophets ever of bliss foretold and all that poets ever feigned of old as yielding joy to man shall now be seen and ever flourish like an evergreen then mortals join to hail great natures plan that fully gives to babes those rights it gives to man chorus  to the tune of sally in our alley then let as all join heart in hand through country town and city of every sex and every age young men and maidens pretty to baste this golden ages reign on every hill and valley then paradise shall greet our eyes through every street and alley appendix a contrast between paines agranian justice and spences end of oppression both being built on the same indisputable principle viz that the land is the common property of mankind under the system of agraian justice the people will as it were sell their birthright for a mess of porridge by accepting of a paltry consideration in lien of their rights under the system of the end of oppression the people will receive without deduction the whole produce of their common inheritance under the first the people will become supine and careless in respect of public affairs knowing the utmost they can receive of the public money under the second the people will be vigilant and watchful over the public expenditure knowing that the more there is saved their dividends will be the larger under the first the people will be more like pensioned emigrants and french priests than interested natives under the second the people will be all intent upon the improvement of their respective parishes for the sake of the increased shares of the revenues which on that account they will receive under the first the people cannot derive right of suffrage in national affairs from their compromisory stipends under the second universal suffrage will be inseparably attached to the people both in parochial and national affairs because the revenues both parochial and national will be derived immediately from their common landed property under the first the government may be either absolute monarchy ariftocracy democracy or mixed under the second the government must of necessity be democratic under the first all the complexities of the present public establishments which support such hosts of placemen will not only still continue but also the evils of them will be greatly enhanced by the very system of agrarian justice under the second there can be but two descriptions of public officers parochial and national and those but few in number and on moderate salaries under the first there will exist two spirits incompatible in a free state the insolent and overbearing spirit of aristocracy and the sneaking unmanly spirit of conscious dependence under the second there will exist only the robust spirit of independence mellowed and tempered by the presence and checks of equally independent fellowcitizens under the first the destructive profligacy of the great and the wretched degencracy of the poor will still continue and will increase to the pitiable unhappiness of both parties under the second all the virtues being the natural offspring of a general and happy mediocrity will at once step forth into use and progressively increase their blessed influence among men under the first taxes both directly and indirectly will not only be demanded but will be increased to the utmost the people can possibly bear let trade and seasons be ever so prosperous under the second there can be no taxes nor expenses of collecting them because the government would be supported by a poundage from the rents which each parish would send quarterly to the national treasury free of all expense thus leaving the price of all commodities unencumbered with any addition but the price of labor under the first the poor would ill continue through desr unambitious under the second the lowest and most prostigate having such frequent opportunities to arise out of their hopeless state of abject wretchedness and vulgarity by the aid of their quarterly dividends of starting into industrious and decent modes of life could not always resist the influence of the general virtue every where displayed without some time or other following the example under the first children will still be considered as grievous burdens in poor families under the second as both young and old share equally alike of the parish revenues children and aged relations living in a family will especially in rich parishes where the dividends are large through high rents or the productions of mines etc be accounted as blessings under the first if the aristocratic assistance afforded by charityschools in the education of poor children be withdrawn the laboring classes must inevitably degenerate into barbarous ignorance under the second if the people are not generally learned it must be their own fault as their inexhaustible means of comfortable subsistence must furnish also the means of education under the first the poor must still look up for aristocratic benefactions of rotten potatoes and spoiled rice and other substitutes for bread in the times of scarcity to preserve their wretched existence under the second what with the annihilation of taxes and the dividends of the parochial rents together with the honest guardianship of their popular government we may reasonably suppose that the people will rarely be driven to the dire necessity of using a substitute for bread under the first after admitting that the earth belongs to the people the people must nevertherless compromise the matter with their conquerors and oppressors and still suffer them to remain as a distinct and separate body under the second after insisting that the land is public property the peoples oppressors must either submit to become undistinguishable in the general mass of citizens of fly the country among them in full possession of their country under the first in foreign or domestic trade increase the productions of the land will increase in price of which the landed interest will reap the advantage by raising the rents in due proportion until the whole benefit thereof centers in them under the second if foreign or domestic trade increase the price of commodities will in proportion also increase and the rens of course will rise but this increase will revert back to the body of the people by increasing their quarterly dividends under the first all the aristocratic monopolies in ade in privileges and government will continue under the second there can be o monopolies but a fair salutary and democratic competition will pervade every thing under the first a timid and acquiescing spirit must be promoted among the people as now lest they should discover the disumularity between their natural rights and enjoyments under the second the justness and consistency of affairs will invite nay challenge the most rigorous and logical enquiries and will draw forth uncramped the utmost powers of the mind under the first domestic trade will be far from its natural height because multitudes of the people will be poor and beggarly d unable to purchase numberless articles of use and luxury that their wants and inclinations would prompt them to wish for under the second domestic trade would be at an amazing pitch because there would be no poor none but would be well clothed lodged and sed and the whole mass of rents except a triste to the government being circulated at home in every parish every quarter would cause such universal prosperity as would enable every body to purchase not only the necessaries of life but many elegancies and luxuries under the first the fund proposed by palne will require a great number of placemen of various descriptions to manage it and who being chosen as they must under the second the government can have very little influence by places because the parish officers will be chosen by the parishioners and all the complex machinery be by the ministry and their friends will very much increase the already enormous influence of governments of financiering and stockjobbing all the privileged trading companies and corporate towns which are the nests of influence and corruption would be abolished under the first the rich would abolish all hospitals charitable funds and parochial provision for the poor telling them that they now have all that their great advocate pain demands as their rights and what he exultingly deems as amply sufficient to ameliorate their condition and render them happy by which the latter end of our reformation will be worse than the beginning under the second the quarterly dividends together with the abolishment of all taxes would destroy the necessity of public charities but if any should be thought necessary whether to promote learning or for any other purpose the parochial and national funds would be found at all times more than sufficient  conclusion but stop dont let us reckon without our host for mr pain will object to such and equal distribution of the rents for says he in his agrarian justice the public can claim but a tentk part of the value of the landed property as it now exists with its vast improvements of cultivation and building but why are we to be put off now with but a tenth share because says mr pain it has so improved in the hands of private proprietors as to be of ten times the value it was of in its natural state but may we not ask who improved the land did the proprietors alone work and toll at this improvement and did we laborers and our forefathers stand like indians and hottentots idle spectators of so much publicspirited industry i suppose not nay on the contrary it is evident to the most superficial enquirer that the laboring classes ought principally to be thanked for every improvement  indeed if there had never any slave any vassals or any daylabourers employed in building and tillage then the proprietors might have boasted of having themselves created all this gay scene of things but the case alters amazingly when we consider that the earth has been cultivated either by slaves compelled like beasts to labor of by the indigent objects whom they first exclude from a share in the soil that want may compel them to sell their labor for daily bread in short the great may as well boast of fighting their battles as of cultivating the earth  the toil of the laboring classes first produces provisions and they the demand of their families creates a market for them therefore it will be found that it is the markets made by the laboring and mechanical tribes that have improved the earth and once take away these markets order all the laboring people like the israelites leave the country in a body and you would immediately see from what cause the country had been cultivated and so many goodly towns and villages built  you may suppose that after the emigration of all these beggarly people every thing would go on as well as before that the farmer would continue to plough and the town landlord to build as formerly i tell you nay for the farmer could neither proceed without laborers or d purchasers for his corn and cattle it would be just the same with the building landlord for he could neither procure workmen to build nor tenants to pay him rent  behold then your grand voluptuous nobility and gentry the arch cultivators of the earth obliged for lack of servants again to turn gothic hunters like their lavage forefathers behold their palaces temples and towns mouldering into dust and affording shelter only to wild beasts and their boasted cultivated fields and garden degenerated into a howling wilderness  thus we see that the consumption created by the mouths and the backs of the poor despised multitude contributes to the cultivation of the earth as well as their hands and it is also the rents that they pay that builds the towns and not the racking building landlord therefore let us not in weak commiseration be biassed by the pretended philanthropy of the great to the resignation of our dearest rights and if our estates have improved in their hands during their fficious guardianship the d  v  i thank them for it was done for their own sakes not for cuts and can be no just bar against us recovering our rights  finis
