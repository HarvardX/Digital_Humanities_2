athelstan a tragedy as it is acted at the theater royal in drury lane  london printed for lockyer davis and charles reymers against graysinngate holbourn and at lord bacons head in fleet street mdcclvi price one shilling and sixpence  il ne faut pourtant pas croire que les grecs manquent de feu tout sanime au contraire tout parle tout agit dans leurs ecrits mais cest plus laction and le spectacle que les paroles and plus la passion and le sentiment que le discourse au lieu que les francois ont souvent done dans le discourse and les paroles pour suppleer au spectacle ou a la passion combien de portraits de sentences and de lieux communs bien frappes ont arrache des applaudissemens qui devoient etre reserves a lemotion theatrale quon ne sentoit pas ce nest que le sang froid qui applaudit a la beauty des verse dans un spectacle  brumoy theat des grecs  to his grace the duke of devonshire lord lieutenant of ireland my lord it was the frequent practice of the ancient greek tragedians to make their compositions for the theater subservient to the welfare of the state the legislators wisdom was enforced by the poets art public guilt was stigmatized and public virtue applauded of this kind somewhat is or ought to be shadowed out in the following tragedy  but it may possibly be asked why this address from a writer who is and determines to remain unknown  my lord it comes from one who although he has not wanted opportunities has ever scorned to prostitute addresses of this kind to views of interest but if it has for once happened in his time that virtue and power are eminently united his honest disdain of offering incense to the one shall not intimidate him from avowing his reverence of the other  more especially the natural relation which the design of this tragedy bears to your graces conduct gives its author a kind of equitable title without leave to prefix your name thus while he delineates rebellion he contrasts it with true loyalty and to an example of sedition drawn from ancient days opposes a character from modern life who in the highest station and most perilous times has been the restorer of unity and concord  i am my lord with the highest esteem your graces most obedient servant the author  prologue written by the author of the tragedy spoken by mr holland in the character of the genius of britain to warn the sons of freedom to be wise

near london time from the evening till midnight  athelstan act   scene   the open camp harold gothmund a warrior by our gods of denmark i could have sacked ten cities since the morn the lingering sun goes down and yet beholds the danish sword hang powrless over the foe to him dunelm dunelm well met  what means this vile delay what have thou seen  dunelm from yonder eminence even now i saw proud london wrapped in fire harold behold yon dusky wreaths of smoke yon pitchy cloud is fraught with glorious ruin  harold indeed  dunelm i saw the flames besiege the tower which proudly had scorned the general assault of denmarks power soon spread the sulphurd fires mining it is base at length with horrid crash the pile fell headlong like a wreck of nature and as it fell a hollow murmur pierced mine ear that seemed an armys dying groan i saw the breach in the proud citys wall where our brave danes poured in while shouts of conquest dismayed the flying rear harold ere this the citys won  harold no more  i am sorry for it  dunelm what when our troops through ten long moons have toiled till siege and fell disease have thind our ranks before this capital this haughty london the mistress of the island when her towers are humbled in the dust even then to wear that clouded eye much it might suit a briton but ill becomes a dane  harold have i not cause to hate our general  dunelm grant it yet no cause to hate the victories his sword has gained for denmarks weal  harold dishonor blast his laurels ere since i won full glory from our wars he checks my valor lest it should oertop and shadow his  behold this very day when mighty london falls a prey to denmark i am pent within the circuit of a camp on an obscure and ignominious charge my sword inglorious sleeps within its scabbard deprived its prey yes well he knew this arm had led the storm as erst it did to him and his compeers when norways frozen cities sunk at my frown when through conflicting hosts i opened the dreadful track while far behind he loyterd in the breach and poorly reaped the gleanings of my faulcion  dunelm peace brave harold nor let dissension blot the general triumph  harold here dunelm here shall deep revenge lie pent mustring it is rage but soon the impatient flood shall burst the mound and overwhelm his pride yes may i never more win the wreath of conquest never fall triumphant in the field of fame but groan out life stretched on the unmanly couch if i repay not gothmunds uncausd hate with deadliest vengeance  dunelm let thy vengeance wait some darker hour  behold where goodwin comes his eye speaks victory and his glad step prevents the welcome tidings of his tongue  scene ii to them goodwin goodwin hail valiant harold this great day shall shine in denmarks annals gothmund sends thee greeting with the glad news of englands overthrow himself shall soon arrive  harold brave goodwin welcome more welcome for thy tidings london then englands chief boast is fallen   goodwin even now it burns see yon ascending clouds yon pillard smoke that hides the welkin is it is last remain the english powers have left the bleeding ramparts the wide breach choked with heaps of slain on which we mounted to the storm  harold how went the day where fought our general gothmund  goodwin on the thames soon as the signal of assault was given the danish fleet came on our standard then the raven hovering on his wing appeared with ominous glare and seemed to croak destruction then furious gothmund from the crowded decks followed by shouting thousands leapt to shore with ruinous assault  harold what no resistance  goodwin yes bloody was the fray the scale of war hung doubtful till the mighty athelstan mercias brave duke to denmarks aid came on spurred by a keen revenge more strong than glory led his revolted mercians up the breach and mingled in the storm  harold what next ensued  goodwin confusion and wild rout for englands power dreading the vengeful sword of athelstan shrunk from his rage then denmarks star prevailed the britons fled and now by right of war the citys wealth it is captive youth and virgins are fallen the soldiers plunder  harold it seems then gothmund owes full half his conquest to athelstans revenge  goodwin aye more than half never did such deadly valor sweep the field his hoary head clasped in a steel ribd helm he sprung to vengeance and forgot old age with such a headlong course he led the war that denmarks troops nay his own firey mercians lingered behind while he attended only by death and fate which at his right hand raged thind the retreating foe  harold thank we the gods who sow dissension in these british hearts else never had this fair city fallen our prey  dunelm know ye the cause why this proud duke of mercia revolted from his king  goodwin pride and revenge some suit denied him which the royal bounty unequal to the cravings of it is people granted his foe no more his firey spirit mounted to sudden rage with secret levy he mustered all his powers and joined with denmark to overwhelm his country  harold be it ours to nurse this useful treason thus invading while we divide we conquer  dunelm hark i hear the shouts of victory  goodwin gothmund approaches his troops come laden with the precious spoil of this imperial city captive maids the sweet reward of valor grace his triumph and infants doomed to drink the bitter draught of endless slavery in a foreign clime  scene iii to them gothmund in triumph a train of prisoners and egbert in chains as a prisoner harold hail valiant gothmund denmarks proudest boast whom mighty odin the dread god of war has crowned with englands conquest  gothmund faithful harold the citys won london whose haughty towers we shook so long with terrible assault at length is fallen and blazes to the sky twas pity harold on so great a day when the rich plunder of the war was seized thy valor lost it is prey but fair division of our acquired spoil of wealth and captives shall bring thee recompense  harold i thank thee general devoted to thy will i held my charge to guard our camp from the outsallying foe a charge less splendid than the post in battle yet as conducing to the general weal no whit less honorable  gothmund harold behold this train of captives to thy charge i give them but chiefly that stern youth whose arm opposed singly to mine long held the conflict doubtful no common ransom shall redeem him hence why do thou frown to egbert egbert because i dare to scorn my countrys foe  gothmund so haughty in thy chains what title bear thou  egbert it is enough for thee to know me still a briton thence to fear me  gothmund a conquror fear his captive by our gods speak but another word audacious christian i will plunge thee in the deep norwegian mine among these slaves the vassals of my sword to toil in darkness through the livelong year till baleful damps consume thee  egbert yes bury me in darkness in the depth where slavery drinks the pestilential vapor for that i have lived to see my countrys fall i dare thee to the deed rapacious dane but well i know thy hand expects the ransom nor aught but avarice chains thy cruelty  gothmund what shall i waste the hours in fruitless parle with an audacious slave  lo mercias duke comes with his warlike train retire ye slaves and at an awful distance bow to valor  they retire backwards this firey athelstan yes i could curse aside his sword victorious and wide wasting arm that blasted all my wreaths and won the praise of this eventful day  hence envious fame shall tarnish gothmunds glory while she whispers orhaply to the listening world proclaims that britain conquered britain  come fell hate pour all thy poison on my heart and turn friendship to enmity  should he revolt  the rebel dare not nor can ever repass the gulf which he has leapt and severs him for ever from his country  yet it is meet that prudence greet him with fair speech and smiles till some desired occasion yield pretense and spurn him off to shame  let denmarks raven wave his dreadful wing aloud to hail the glad approach of athelstan and sound in honor of our firm ally the instruments of war  scene iv to them athelstan with his train gothmund i greet thee athelstan thy mighty arm on this great day has shamed it is former doings through the red tracks of death i saw thee seek the king his troops stricken with coward guilt fled trembling at the sight of injured valor waked into wrath yes wondering denmark saw how terror stalked before thee through the streets while thy broad faulcion flamed and dread revenge frowned on thy helm like fate  athelstan no flattery gothmund balm to the fools it wounds the brave mans ear my sword has reaped sull vengeance on its foes and vanquished ethelred with tears and groans shall rue the wrongs he did me  gothmund valiant duke such vengeance well became such wrongs as thine  athelstan my wrongs were loud for vengeance pity wept but reason choked her voice  for awful justice must drop her sword unnerve her lifted arm unbridled power turn order into chaos should pity melt at proud oppressions fall  what youth is that who from the captive throng comes forth with haughty strides  gothmund an unknown briton yet fierce in battle for his sword was fatal to many a dane and midst the falling ranks raged like a whirlwind mark his fearless mien he wears the pride of conquest though in chains his eye devours thee athelstan   athelstan i reck not let him come on i will meet his pride unmoved egbert advancing who dares to frown on athelstan  egbert a briton  athelstan who art thou  egbert one who heedless of thy rage dares throw his scorn on guilt  athelstan audacious captive think thou i fear thy frown  egbert oh bleeding england behold thy fatal foe he bursts into tears athelstan weepst thou brave youth though i have poured destruction on thy king i wage no war with captives generous warrior my power shall shield thee and unbind thy chains  egbert stand off  i choose to wear them  athelstan why that choice  egbert lest these brave captive britons shackled there should brand me for a traitor  athelstan heed thee well think what thou art and where   egbert thank heaven i am not athelstan  athelstan nay i can frown too   egbert blush  rather blush the crimson hue of shame would better suit thy crimes  gothmund peace arrogant youth  athelstan who gave to thee this privilege of scorn this right of insult and bold accusation  egbert that power who gave me reason and humanity that awful power above who bids me dare to strip false treason of her mask of pride and show the hag in her own shape and hue the foulest fiend of hell  athelstan thy chains protect thee  gothmund goodwin lead forth these captives to the fleet and let the first fair breeze that fills the sail waft them to denmarks shore  harold bear hence and guard that insolent pointing to egbert egbert farewell brave friends my faithful countrymen i weep your fate doomed to the oppressions of a barbarous clime oh may some friendly storm in pity rise and bid the fury of devouring seas in mercy swallow you  accursed treason lo thy devoted train oh false false athelstan  ex egbert harold goodwin dunelm and captives athelstan go froward briton  gothmund valiant athelstan heed not a captives clamor denmark now boasts thee her friend and for undoubted proof of that esteem wherewith i note thy valor behold the precious spoils my arm has won amid the general plunder gold or captives lands palaces whatever inventive passion can fancy for enjoyment waits thy will command it for it is thine  athelstan of gold or lands the plunder of the war i reck not aught for to the noble mind a great revenge outweighs all other good this i have reaped fullmeasurd of my thankless countrys blood my sword has drank even to satiety no other boon it craves  gothmund brave athelstan even as thou will  has then no precious spoil enriched thy valor  athelstan yes one beauteous captive won in the citys storm and now consigned to siwards care a brave and faithful friend who leads her hitherward so winning sweet the surly troops gazed on her as she passed and silence spoke their wonder  gothmund such a fair may happily mourn in secret that her lot fell to thy aged arm some youthful warrior might better suit her wish  athelstan i mean to shield her from the rude will of insolent desire  gothmund indeed  athelstan indeed  it was her chaste request and mark me though my arm has quelled it is foes yet athelstan would blush to wreak his vengeance on a defenseless woman  gothmund by what chance did thou obtain this captive  athelstan while the storm raged in the streets fate led my conquering band where this fair captive mourned the lot of war i found her kneeling with uplifted eyes and majesty resigned imploring heaven roused by the shouts of war she rose her train filled all the place with female lamentation but she in grief superior checked their cries and graced her woes with regal dignity with such a noble mien she sud for mercy that vengeance stood subdued while nameless graces beauty and mildness and majestic grief like guardian powers which heaven had planted round her checked the rude access of unhallowed rage that even the sons of violence dropped the sword to gaze at awful distance  towered her tent this way she moves with her attendant train behold her here  scene v to them thyra edwina siward and female attendants gothmund indeed supremely fair  athelstan thyra be comforted nay dry these tears else shall i deem my too officious cares lost on a thankless heart  thyra oh athelstan whose mercy speaks thee brave forgive these tears for my dear lord to me than life more dear these sorrows flow  indeed my thankful heart melts in warm gratitude to thy kind care which saved me from the horrors of this day but oh  my husband  gothmund why these streaming tears what of her husband did he fall in battle  athelstan that is her fear though rumor yet speak doubtful of his fate  thyra too sure he is fallen  ye generous warriors hear  hear a poor captives prayer  oh let your guards conduct my faithful servants to the field or give me safeguard through the deathful scene i will divest me of my womans fear and with a scythian boldness tread in gore drag off the heaps of overwhelming foes till i have found my egberts dear remains to give them burial the last mournful duty i ever can pay his love  athelstan despond not fair one happily he yet may live  thyra oh flattering hope grant me but that  but that ye powers of heaven  gothmund now by our gods of denmark athelstan this is too bright a fair for age like thine idly to gaze on  athelstan beauty thus afflicted merits my powrs protection  gothmund is she not the captive of thy sword  athelstan true but the sword that won shall guard her  gothmund what if gothmunds will should raise this fair one from the captive throng to grace his bed  athelstan by law of war she is mine and i have sworn protection  gothmund from thy foe to shield thy captive were a task of praise worthy thy arm but when a true ally thy friend in war entreats so small a boon   athelstan gothmund the friend whose erring wish demands what honor cannot yield  i pray no more   gothmund if gothmunds friendship in thy thankless heart insensible to all my proffered bounty stands at so cheap a price  protect thy captive  let thy power shield her as it may  lead on   exit gothmund athelstan imperious dane would thou bend athelstan beneath thy pride  his parting words and looks darted contempt  this the reward of conquest this valors recompense  siward twas what i feared  why did revenge seduce thee from thy king bear witness heaven if ever i trod the field or barred my sword in seeming aid of denmark save in the honest hope to check thy vengeance  athelstan what to a thankless king a favored foe basking beneath the royal smile to yield with cowardlike submission  friend no more the dye of fate is thrown  siward did thou not see how passion kindled while with ardent gaze he eyed fair thyras charms his soul has caught a swift and deep infection mark the event  athelstan weak is thy fear though bold in violence he dare not wake my rage  thyra oh generous duke behold me at thy feet i see the storm fast gathering over my head redeem redeem me from this rapacious dane i dread not death whose image from my earliest age of woe has been the calm companion of my thoughts then let thy arm which on this fatal morn did shield me now complete it is generous care my forfeit life is thine in pity kill me ere yet dishonor blot my innocence  athelstan by my good sword which won thee in the storm again i swear not denmarks proudest threat shall wrest thee from me  siward are my mercians campd in their separate quarter  siward aye my lord westward a mile on a fair rising ground fast by the rivers brink  athelstan this night i meant to pass in council with the general gothmund on future enterprise but since his pride brooks no control  would heaven i had not come since it is thus  at least his pride shall seek me and if i find him bent on violence the morning sun shall see me quit his camp have thou prepared fair thyras tent by mine  siward i did command it so  athelstan retire we then  thyra i merit not thy care why should i live when my dear lord is lost and england fallen  athelstan touch not on that  for by this arm it fell yes i have washed my footsteps in the blood of my despairing foes  but oh for whom i will think no more  come thyra to thy tent  end of the first act act ii scene i the open camp gothmund harold dunelm gothmund have thou not seen her harold  harold much i have heard her beauty dwells on every soldiers tongue and half eclipses conquest  gothmund oh such beauty harold her eyes bright beam might thaw the cold norwegians breast or warm the frozen sons of lapland into love  oh earth and heaven my souls on fire  the glories of the war the wreaths of conquest sicken on her sight avaunt ambition yield thy throne to love harold she must be mine  harold what lets thee then what bar so strong to guard her from thy wish each cobweb hindrance to thy breath shall yield if thou but will her thine  gothmund may i never taste the warriors lot in death never quaff the rich mead in the infernal courts where mighty odin rules the glorious dead if i not seize her beauties  but brave harold this delicate captive is no common food like what we snatch in every citys plunder for gross desire to seed on i would win her souls consent would kindle mutual passion to meet my flame at least by fair persuasion would temper power that the effect might seem without all show of violence harold haste thee to the fair captives tent tell her the gods of denmark claim their wonted sacrifice of captive youths and thirst for englands gore but if her dear consent shall crown my wish our gods propitious will accept her smile in ransom for their blood paint forth the terrors of the dread sacrifice the victims bound the howling incantations of our priests invoking hell the glittering faulcion barred the streaming gore and horrors of the altar the mournful tale shall melt her into grief and pity plead consent  harold i wait thy will yet were my counsel worthy gothmunds ear   gothmund what would thou  say   harold some captive briton best would bend her pride  gothmund not so these stubborn britons unconquered even in chains defy our swords awful in ruin like their kindred oaks though blasted by the thunder of the war they proudly bear their scorched ribs aloft and brave the power that struck them therefore harold that hope is vain  harold persuasion sure would flow prompt and more powerful from some captives tongue to death or endless slavery doomed yet soothed with hope and promised freedom for the speech of mimic art is weak and sinewless to the strong workings of the laboring soul when passion glows within  gothmund it is well advised then lead some captive briton to her tent on this great purpose but over all i fear this haughty athelstan he claims her his by law of battle and has sworn protection  harold is gothmunds power so weak then that he dreads a traitors frown  gothmund nay by our gods i will seize her though he and all the witching powers of hell though the weird sisters and each horrible shape that haunts the midnight forest hemm her round with magic incantation  harold speed thee i will wait thee in my tent   exit gothmund scene ii harold now spirit of mischief rise welcome foul fiend that ridst the carr of night and scatterst plagues with unseen hand  dunelm he fears me not nor dreams what tempest soon shall blacken round did thou not mark that frowning captive egbert  dunelm i did  harold he best will bear the generals love to thyras tent  command him hither dunelm exit dunelm his generous heart shall burn with fierce disdain and strengthen thyras virtue into scorn which pity cannot bend  so black a purpofe known and proclaimed may happily rouse to rage the duke of mercia in whose fiery breast lies fury ripe to catch and blaze in flames oh for some swift occasion that my breath may kindle discord into deadly feud like angry clouds that sail on warring winds their sierce conflicting wrath shall meet in thunder and ruin close the fray   scene iii to him egbert harold welcome brave youth thy fame and known preeminence in valor have called thee to a generous task of duty for britains weal  thou know by doom of war full fifty captives to our gods must bleed  egbert so doom your fancied gods the vain creation of fear and cruelty but righteous heaven that sees your blindness with a pitying eye detests the sacrifice  harold prevent it then  egbert name but the means if my devoted blood can save my guiltless countrymen from death i yield it to the altar  harold valiant egbert a gentler task is thine a captive beauty brightens yon tent she has subdued our general the rage of love is on him if thy tongue can win her to his bed   egbert harold no more think thou because i drag the chain of war my soul must wear your shackles fallen a captive i bear a britons heart the coward only earns safety by dishonor  harold yet many a briton would deem it service worth a brave mans care to save devoted innocence from death at this cheap price weighed with the blood of man what is this unknown womans weal or woe this captive thyras honor  egbert thyra  thyra what thyra  harold athelstans fair captive thyra what terrors in that name what wonder moves thee  egbert ye powers of heaven  harold if you are a man if ever brave compassion touched thy breast if ever the tender names of wife and husband the bleeding anguish of despairing virtue the love of worth or piety to heaven did sway thy heart to great and generous deeds or melted thee to pity hear me now that thyra is my wife  harold indeed thy wife  egbert so sure as infamy is hovering over her my wife devoted to this ruffians lust  harold egbert i love the valor of a foe and worth like thine turns enmity to praise how will thy bosom burn with honest rage when hissing scorn proclaims   egbert oh thou have shook my firmest fortitude i thought her dead when she was lost what more could egbert fear hence cold despair had gathered over my soul wrapped it in ice from every sense of ill and chained the struggling tear but her loved name has roused me from this lethargy of woe has thawed the frozen horrors of my heart and melted me to childhood grief and joy and fear and hope in tumult rise within me while through the moistened channels of mine eyes these sorrows flow  yes for thy sake thy egbert weeps his captivity  harold waste not in tears the precious minutes speed thee to her tent dishonor and pollution hover over it  egbert perdition seize the robber generous harold lead me to aid this helpless innocence hear me brave countrymen and witness heaven that to redeem your deathdevoted blood egbert would yield his own  but oh my wife what yield her to a russians lust  nay rather i will dash her beauties into wounds and horror for lust to start at  lead me to her tent my laboring heart will burst  harold the attending guard shall guide thee to her tent  exeunt scene iv changes to thyras tent thyra edwina sure it is some warning power that whispers here my beating heart forebodes the approach of fate and labors with the event  edwina come friend of my life dear partner of my woes teach me to combat these surrounding terrors that overwhelm my soul  edwina take comfort thyra all may be well  thyra oh

tents  egbert through the wide waste of mortal war i sought my virtuous thyra to save her from the foe but sought in vain then rushing on the thickest war my sword edged by despair i mowed my way to
