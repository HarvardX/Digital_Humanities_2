page        pamela a comedy  as it is performed gratis at the late theater in goodmansfields  london printed for h hubbard near the royal exchange      price six pence  to her royal highness princess amelia when addresses of this sort are made to persons of your royal highnesss elevated state it is i believe usual previously to supplicate leave for their reception  but here i presume it would have been as equally needless for the author to have implored your royal highnesss name for protectress in the cause of virtue as it would be for the master of the mint to petition in form your royal father for leave to stamp his name on our coin to give sanction to its currency  the inducements madam to throw this piece therefore under your royal highnesss protection were solely from considering it as an act of duty added to the pride of having the high honor to subscribe myself  may it please your royal highness your highnesss most obedient most devoted humble servant the author  prologue spoken by a gentleman as in the airy regions of romance the adventrous knight sets out with shield and lance strait his disinterested valor flies to helpless damsels and to beautys cries this only motive rising in his breast the godlike plea  of innocence distressed thus dares our authorerrant of tonight in virtues aid romantically fight sacred to her the champion pen he draws enough rewarded  to support her cause tonight his honest labor means to prove a lowborn virtue worth a great mans love an honest pride where conscious honor glows an artless innocence  whence truth still flows a sense proceeding but from natures light for little knowledge serves us to be right a merit greatly poor that far outshines the glare of titles or the wealth of mines such steadfast honesty should find success over the abandoned authors of distress over those who glory to betray a maid who welcome guilt and make deceit a trade yet some there are less liable to blame who only want reflection to reclaim who bend unthinking to the syrens voice the reprobates of custom not of choice who deaf to precept plead example still and think the mode indemnifies the ill to such our author offers this address not certain nor despairing of success amongst this cast of men he hopes to find some converts  for the honor of mankind on minds like these his morals may prevail and who escaped a sermon feel

harry why did not i tell thee some strange combustion would happen from my dream   isaac nay to be sure dreams dreams are great prognosticators   harry prognosticators  ay marry be they they never faird me yet   benj nor me  for ye all know the very next day after i dreamed i fell into the horsepond and arthur here took me out half drowned and brought me to the kitchen fire and methought being mortal weak i fell out of the chair and was scorched most fearfully and to be sure the next day  ay  the very next day  was i taken with the ague and fever   arth why my book of dreams gives mazing accounts of robbers being taken and murders brought to light seven years after they were done   isaac to be sure  to be sure  but prithee harry tell us thy dream   benj  ay let us hear it let us hear it   harry why last market day i came home as twere a little tipsy and laid me down in the stable on a truss of straw and fell fast asleep and there what should i dream but that our house was turned into a windmill   all merciful sirs   harry ay a windmill  and that mrs jewkes masters lincolnshire house keeper was the millers man and we four to be sure turned into asses  and  murrain take her  nothing would serve her turn but she would have us to draw in place of the horses  but methought we were plaguey resty  for to be sure never was the like heard of and jirk us about she did most cruelly    isaac ay they say she is a mortal cross woman  well well but so   harry so methought at a little distance from the mill was good mrs jervis our housekeeper here and pretty mrs pamela my late ladys waiting woman with each a bundle under their arms as if so be they were going to seek their fortunes  and is not all this now plainly made out  is not the whole house in a quandary and a terrible uproar is not the squire as it were turned to another sort of a man and mainly altered for the worse and are not mrs jervis and mrs pamela discharged out of their service and ordered to gather up their things and provide themselves    isaac ay and does not master longman the steward say the squire talks of sending for that same mrs jewkes   benj ay and then comes our share of this woeful dream    harry well but my lads i have some sweet  bitter too  i overheard master longman tell mrs jervis the squire was looking out for a wife and that will be a rare time for vails for to be sure we shall have more comers and goers than a beehive in a summers day   arth ay marry those would be joyful times indeed and i wish with all my heart the poor dear souls mrs jervis and mrs pamela were to stay and take part   benj what a murrain makes the squire in such a fluster with them though   harry why you must know mrs pamela they say has been a little too bold and given master untoward answers and you know he is deadly haughty and passionate but poor soul i wonder how it should chance so for to be sure i never heard her give any living soul in the house a wry word   isaac nor i  she is as gentle as a lamb   benj no more gall than a pidgeon   harry why so mrs jervis told master and talked a little roundly they say which made his honor in such a desperate passion that he ordered her to provide too  odsheart that same pamelas a dainty girl  but deadly shy i dont think a servant in the house durst ever give her so much as a civil salute   isaac well well no matter for that she is a precious goodnatured soul  odso here is the steward and mrs jervis  she is giving up her charge  and twont become us to be seen loitering here   omnes away away   exeunt scene ii enter mr longmrn and mrs jervis mrs jerv i hope mr longman you find every thing properly and justly accounted for   mr long so justly good mrs jervis that i am under great concern to find my masters warmth of temper so little consistent with his interest to discharge a person from his family who has many years with such prudence and justice so well acquitted her trust   mrs jerv your approbation of my conduct mr longman next to that of our masters is its best justification   mr long you have more than that good mrs jervis the approbation and good wishes of the whole family which seldom go hand in hand with a frugality like yours for the good opinion of the lower servants in a family is rarely obtained but by indulgencies hurtful to the interest of its master  and i could wish you would give me leave for the advantage and pleasure of ours to solicit mr belvile for your continuance   mrs jerv why mr longman there are many prevailing reasons to accept with pleasure your kind offer  and what i am apt to think may induce his honor not to reject it is the removal of the dear unhappy though innocent occasion of his resentment to me   mr long the lovely pamela you mean oh mrs jervis there is i fear another motive which your discretion and regard to my masters honor has concealed that renders his resentment as you call it inexcusable to both   mrs jerv but his complying with the good girls earnest request to be sent home to her father and mother is i think a sufficient proof of his resolution no longer to entertain such thoughts that might as you but too justly suspect prove hurtful to dear pamelas virtue and his own honor   mr long it is true  and i am heartily rejoiced to find the temptation will be removed from both for twoud be a hard task mrs jervis for poor pamela strong as she is in virtue to withstand the artful insinuating snares of a handsome wealthy man like our master and i fear a much harder for him to overcome his too warm desire for so tempting an object were they to have constant opportunities of seeing each other   mrs jerv i should have few fears of her side were i certain he would employ no other power than persuasion   mr long why i think the young creatures almost unequalled by any of her tender years in the principles of piety and virtue  and it warms my very heart that one so young should so earnestly prefer sharing the poverty of her good parents with the preservation of her honesty to all the enticing baits of finery and grandeur with the loss of it  but however it is better as it is  but it is now pretty near the time his honor ordered me to attend him in his closet with your accounts and then i will make bold to tell him my opinion in relation to you mrs jervis a good day to you   mrs jerv and to you worthy mr longman  exeunt scene iii belvile alone how weakly founded is the opinion that happiness is seated in large possessions though till lately i have had but little reason to dissent from that opinion and have ever made my fortune subservient to my pleasures  and shall i now suffer a peevish low born girl to interrupt their course and with the musty principles of virtue preach me from my purpose  no i am determined not to sacrifice my pursuits of pleasure and substantial joy to her wild imaginary notions of virtue and honor  it is certainly the first time they ever took such deep root in a cottage and i will yet try if i have not force enough to destroy these wondrous rural battlements and reduce the romantic governor to capitulate   scene iv belvile and longman belv well mr longman have you looked over this insolent housekeepers accounts   long yes sir and find them in every article just to a tittle  and i hope sir you will not be offended if i presume to say i fear twill be difficult for your honor to meet with a servant with less insolence and so much fidelity   belv why thou imaginest the chief merit of servants consists in their honesty   long i confess sir i think it is so in all mankind   belv it is a sign thou have conversed but little with the gay world  amongst them the strongest cement of regard is the mutual indulgence of each others pleasures  and morals make up no part of their friendships  but in servants it is an absolute duty to conform to their masters foibles and show an implicit obedience to all his commands    long may i take the liberty sir of giving my opinion on this head though it differs from yours   belv ay freely   long why then sir were it possible and i think it hardly so that your honor should impose any commands on me which my little portion of reason informed me would prove prejudicial to your morals character and reputation i should think myself as much bound in duty to reject such commands and use my weak endeavors to convince you of their consequence as i have thought myself bound to obey you in all you have hitherto been pleased to honor me with   belv sure this old fellow has no suspicion of my attempts on pamela aside but mr longman do you think me capable of imposing any commands on mrs jervis that might prove pernicious to my honor   long pardon me good sir  you were pleased to mention an implicit duty necessary in servants and that drew from me my opinion   belv perhaps i might  but as the sentiments of others not my own  and i am so well convinced of mrs jerviss regard both to my honor and interest that now passion has subsided were she to make a concession i would restore her   long sir she makes the humblest and by me entreats your goodness to replace her   belv did she employ you for that purpose   long she did sir and i hope not in vain   belv well she may continue  but i will be sworn you have no such commission from that obstinate baggage pamela   long no sir  the poor young creature is so much transported with the thoughts of returning and paying her duty to her good parents she seems little employed about any other concern yet often expresses the most grateful acknowledgments for the bountiful favors bestowed on her by you sir and my good lady your mother   belv you mistake her longman  she is quite insensible to all gratitude and looks upon em merely as due to her great merit   long merit sir with submission i have always observed in her the greatest meekness and humility and that is the character the whole family gives her   belv ay she is a very idol with you all  but no more of her  order robin my lincolnshire coachman to attend me an hour hence   long i shall sir  exit   scene v belvile alone i find in spite of all my pride and resolution this little gipsey is still fluttering round my heart  have her i must  yet i see but slender hopes of a compliance  and force is base and brutal  nor would i give sixpence for her person without her inclination  ah i am far gone that is plain  heretofore minds had no share in my amors  sdeath i shall turn an errant whining coxcomb  well  and perhaps that may sooner bring madam about than the haughty commanding airs i have given myself  for she has a gentle softness about her  that pride will sooner startle than engage the soothing traps the surest at her age exit scene vi john arnold booted with a letter in the name of ill luck how came the squire to pick me out for this untowardly job  a murrain on it to be sure he read in my face i was falsehearted  thof i cannot call to mind any foul play  save this  i ever did to the poorest mortal breathing  and this  more out of fear than any ill will toward the parties  for to be sure they never deserved it at my hands  for to say truth there is not a better wellnatured young body in this county or the next than mrs pamela  and twoud melt a heart of stone to see the good old folks her parents take on about her  and good notable folk they are adod the old man would have made a special parson well to be sure if any of em should do otherwise than well for want of these plaguey letters his honor has taken from me i shall never be able to sleep in a room by myself  hey day why what a dickens be all the wenches got together for i trow  i will step aside and hearken  retires   scene vii rachel jane hannah cicely and john arnold rach well to be sure this is joyful news    jane by my troth the best news we have had tyear   han i should not be more overjoyed at a new sweetheart   cicely sweetheart i fakins i dont think i should have been half so merry had i been married   rach may i never be married if i believe thee   jane nor i   rach for certain mrs jervis is a mighty good sort of a woman and we are all overjoyed she stays but there is no manner of comparison between a man and a woman   jane none at all none at all   john i cant make out what they are in this taking for  comes forward how now my lasses what is all this merriment about   cicely to be sure he has not heard it   jane why where have thou been moping  not to hear the happiest tidings that ever came to hall   john what tidings   all why mrs jewkes    john is dead i hope    all no no no no   john one at a time good lasses one at a time   cicely why then mrs jewkes  who put us all in such a dismal pucker about his honors sending for her thither is to stay where she is and mrs jervis holds her own and keeps her place   john why marry these are joyful tidings indeed for that same mrs jewkes would have made fearful work  for my part i would have looked out for a new service   all and i   cicely now if mrs pamela were but to stay too we should be as happy as the days long   jane ah she will never bring her proud heart down to ask   han why i wonder jane how it should fall out so but the poor young body never had half so good a word from thee as from all the rest of her fellow servants   john why because she is envious and cannot endure to hear all the servants praise the young woman her goodnature and her featly person   jane perhaps there are people who may think others as fearly as she   cicely and if there were poor soul i will be sworn she would bear em no malice   han ay but you know jane has a sneaking kindness for our harry and ever since he praised mrs pamela so hugely one night in the kitchen jane could never endure the sight of her   jane who told you forsooth i had a sneaking kindness for harry   han why the fortune tellers told us all so for she described harry to a hair and you reddend up to the eyes and was as shamefaced as if she had told you you were breeding   all ha ha ha ha   jane the father why youre all full of your jeers and may hap i could jeer upon others if i was minded to it   han say your worst of me i put you to the defiance   all and i   john come come lasses never wrangle who has a mind to fall too first  i will pass my word none of you design to lead apes in hell as they say  come let us go and take part of the bowl master jonathan the butler has prepared for us all to drink a good journey to mrs pamela and her wellbeing with her father and mother  and then well drink that every lad and lass be asked in the church before the summer pass exeunt end of the first act act ii scene i pamela discovered at a table folding up a letter well my dear father and mother thank heaven this will be the last scrowl you will be troubled with from your poor pamela and i have no fears about me but that i shall return to you innocent as your wishes and my own  though heaven has been pleased to put me upon the severest trials for its preservation  but let me not repine no my heart should rather overflow with thankfulness at my happy blessed deliverance and my masters resolution in permitting me to return to my dear parents with that blessing which will cheer their honest minds and make em shed tears of joy and gladness over their innocent child though almost beat down with poverty and old age wiping her eyes   scene ii enter mrs jervis jerv what still disconsolate my dear pamela i thought thy heart had now been easy and thou had done with tears   pam with all that gave me pain i hope i have but these mrs jervis fall from a quite different cause the reflecting on the comfortable joy i shall both give and receive in meeting my good old parents   jerv well thou art a miracle of innocence and duty i shall never be able to bear the house when thou art gone  twill break my heart  but let me hear from thee my dearest pamela and dont forget me   pam dear mrs jervis i should have little title to that goodness and merit you have often praised in me could i be capable of forgetting that tender and even motherly affection you have always shown me and be assured next the love and duty i owe my dear parents you have the largest share in the heart of poor pamela who can only testify her gratitude by words   jerv dearest child i want no other proofs but my good girl why do thou keep on these clothes still are you resolved to go in them   pam ay no doubt  they are the properest these i can wear without reproach from my poor neighbors or to myself at the fruit of innocence alone and honest industry   jerv why so you may many others my good old lady gave you   pam no they will all appear too fine and flaunting for my humble station nor when they are gone can the circumstances of my poor parents afford me any like em   jerv thou art a dear prudent soul  well pamela his honor has ordered the travellingchariot to carry you and lincolnshire robin to drive but he directed me to tell you he must see you before you go and that he has something particular to advise you about   pam what am i to undergo more persecution i hoped he would have suffered me to depart with that ease and quietness of mind into which i had composed myself   jerv dont be alarmed my dear  he seems quite changed and reflected with great concern upon the injuries he had offered you and i verily think you might even venture to stay which with a very serious grave look he ordered me to tell you you might if you thought fit without the least apprehensions of his renewing his attempts upon you   pam that may be true  and for his sake i hope it is but staying i am sure would be a strong inducement to the renewing his attempts since that would give him sufficient reason to conclude my resenting his treatment was what i have heard it called the little artifice and cunning of my sex  and not a determined resolution to preserve my innocence   jerv well thou art best able to distinguish and i will not pretend to give my advice where there is such prudence and understanding  but i think however twill be right to see him since he has requested it in such a manner   pam would he had not requested it for notwithstanding this alteration of behavior you describe my apprehensions of seeing him bring back to my remembrance all his pernicious plots and barbarous usage of me  and yet if i refuse it he will reproach me with insolence and ingratitude and a multitude of crimes my poor hearts a stranger to   jerv come come my dear pamela be comforted i am certain you may see him safely and that his repentance is sincere   pam heaven grant it may  but still my heart is torn with anxious pain and doubts his power his virtue to maintain exeunt scene iii belvile alone if i cannot prevail upon this little baggage to stay i shall have a rare ringing lecture from my outrageous sister she will conclude i have stormed the fort and not finding the plunder answer my expectation have just carried off what i thought most valuable and left the commanding officer to dispose of what remains in the best manner she can  but it is a question faith whether the lady will think fit to do me the honor of an interview  and to confess the truth i have given her pretty substantial reasons to be alarmed  o here comes mademoiselle la governante  enter mrs jervis well mrs jervis did you let mrs pamela know i desired to see her before she went   jerv yes sir and she attends without to wait your commands   belv bid her come in  stay  i will go myself exit   jerv would to heaven the poor creature were safe at home exit   scene iv belvile aad pamela belv prithee dear pamela what needs all this ceremony now you should no longer look upon yourself in the character of a servant   pam it would be the highest presumption sir to consider myself in any other character and the remembrance of it will always fill me with the most grateful pleasing thoughts   belv if the bare recollection can furnish such pleasing ideas i should conclude the continuance of the possession might be more desirable  and that  pamela wholly depends upon your own choice   pam persons in my humble state of life sir ought very seldom if at all to govern their actions by their choice nay sometimes even those of high condition are apt to make very fatal mistakes by a too blind obedience to their choice in the pursuit of what they call pleasures   belv ha well said my little remembrancer  i assure you canted forth with great solemnity  egad i fancy the good old lady my mother mistook both thy sex and genius and instead of teaching thee to raise paste and make cordials thou should have been instructed in administering spiritual comforts  and a smart pretty levite thou had been gods death you baggage what havoc you would have made among the maids   pam mrs jervis informed me sir you had something to say to me of a more serious sort   belv why you little wicked slut can any thing be more serious than turning parson but i have something very serious to say to thee it is upon matrimony and if that is not a serious subject i am at a loss to furnish one in short pamela i have been thinking to make thee some amends for all the rogues tricks i have played thee by getting thee a good husband i have a chaplain in lincolnshire i have promised to provide for one williams he is a likely young fellow if you will stay i will send for him directly the parson has taste and i am sure must be struck with all this youth and beauty kisses her  gods death i could almost marry thee myself   pam sir i beg you will give me leave to withdraw   bell you shall not stir by heaven   pam then i must take the liberty to insist sir upon a different behavior   bell well well it shall have its own humor but what say you to this parson child   pam i say sir i think the subject in general of too solemn a kind to be treated of in the light manner you are pleased to express yourself and as to my particular thoughts of it  i have never yet entertained any nor could i suppose you serious in what you say have i a right to entertain such thoughts without first receiving the approbation of those who have an undoubted power over my mind and person   belv well i will immediately send word to your father of my intention and if he concurs desire him to come hither directly   pam sir in an act of such importance it is certainly my duty first to make a personal application and twill be necessary i should myself have some longer time to reflect upon an act on which the future happiness or misery of my life depends therefore sir i hope i have leave to pursue my resolution of returning home   belv well madam since my friendship meets with so ungrateful a reception you are at liberty to pursue what resolutions you please   pam i humbly thank you sir but let me entreat you not to think so hardly of the unhappy pamela low as she is to interpret that ungrateful which was the effect of duty and a desire to enjoy that liberty which even slaves are allowed on such occasions   bell come come insolent i see plainly under all this mask of duty there lurks a base arrogant suspicion of my sincerity in the proposal  but be assured    enter harry har lady davers sir is just alighted   belv i will wait upon her exit harry the chariot madam is ready to wait upon you when you please   pam

impertinent visit has broke in upon your more agreeable amusements and a conversation so polite as that of your servants must necessarily afford  but i only just stepped up to convince you    bell that you are in a violent warmth without one jot of reason prithee dear child endeavor to subdue these boisterous passions and recollect the advice i have often given you ever to distinguish between the easy dispassionate behavior proper for a woman of quality and the clamorous turbulent outrages of the ladies who have received their education about covent garden   smatt i gad that is a stinger ha ha ha aside   l da by the company that just now left you sir and the extraordinary delicacy in expressing yourself one might reasonably conclude truly the creatures you mention had engrossed the

perish madam but it is extremely severe to construe the effects of wit and genius into an affront   belv upon my word my dear this resentment is most unreasonably founded  pamela who is returning to her father just before your coach stopped was come to pay her compliment of leave and i was only just giving her a short lesson of instruction for her future conduct and    l dav yes yes i make no doubt she has received very notable lessons of instruction which will shortly produce speaking instances of her tutors care   belv upon my honor you injure both the girl and me i think her sincerely virtuous and possessed of every other quality that should compose the amiable and good and more particularly so in her high sense of duty to her parents which so remarkably appears in giving up her advantageous situation in my family to return to their comfort and assistance who it seems are in a very advanced and declining age   nay i promise you i have a much better opinion of the girl than you and if she has preserved her innocence it is wholly owing to her conduct and prudence   belv well i will not dispute the point with you what think you of a turn in the garden before tea   l da no

leaving the family i am concerned at the occasion   pam it is an occasion madam that to me affords a double motive for concern the leaving a family where i have rather been indulged like child than treated as a servant and the unhappy melancholy cause that renders my leaving it unavoidable   l da why ay i am afraid it is an unhappy melancholy cause indeed  but child is it not rather of the latest to reflect upon that now   pam the latest heaven forbid   l da invoking heaven is presumptious while we are apparently under its resentment   pam surely madam it is no presumption in a child to supplicate heaven in the defense of its afflicted parents   l da ha she has her lesson thoroughly perfect why that is mighty pretty truly but child those little arts will not do with me i see through em   pam i am sorry madam you think me fallen so deep in wickedness to effect a sorrow where the strongest ties of duty and religion enforce the tenderest and most sincere   l da you would then really persuade me that you have no other motive for leaving this family but duty to your parents forsooth   pam your ladyship must think me guilty of the highest ingratitude and folly to be induced to leave it from any reasons that arise from want of countenance or indulgence   l da no no  i am only afraid you have had too much countenance and indulgence   pam i hope madam that has not appeared in any part of my behavior   l da then plainly  i imagine my brother and you    pam madam i must humbly take the liberty to interrupt your ladyship and prevent a charge which nothing but the guilt of could
