lud du guernier inv et sculp    the fair penitent a tragedy  written by n row esquire  quin morere ut merita es ferroque averte dolorem virg aen lib    london printed for jacob tonson at shakespeares head over against catherinestreet in the strand mdccxiv  to her grace the duchess of ormond madam the privilege of poetry or it may be the vanity of the pretenders to it has given em a kind of right to pretend at the same time to the favor of those whom their high birth and excellent qualities have placed in a very distinguishing manner above the rest of the world if this be not a received maxim yet i am sure i am to wish it were that i may have at least some kind of excuse for laying this tragedy at your graces feet i have too much reason to fear that it may prove but an indifferent entertainment to your grace since if i have any way succeeded in it it has been in describing those violent passions which have been always strangers to so happy a temper and so noble and so exalted a virtue as your grace is mistress of yet for all this i cannot but confess the vanity which i have to hope that there may be something so moving in the misfortunes and distress of the play as may be not altogether unworthy of your graces pity this is one of the main designs of tragedy and to excite this generous pity in the greatest minds may pass for some kind of success in this way of writing i am sensible of the presumption i am guilty of by this hope and how much it is that i pretend to in your graces approbation if it be my good fortune to meet with any little share of it i shall always look upon it as much more to me than the general applause of the theater or even the praise of a good critic your graces name is the best protection this play can hope for since the world illnatured as it is agrees in an universal respect and deference for your graces person and character in so censorious an age as this is where malice furnishes out all the public conversations where every body pulls and is pulled to pieces of course and where there is hardly such a thing as being merry but at anothers expense yet by a public and uncommon justice to the duchess of ormond her name has never been mentioned but as it ought though she has beauty enough to provoke detraction from the fairest of her own sex and virtue enough to make the loose and dissolute of the other a very formidable party her enemies instead of this they agree to say nothing of her but what she deserves that her spirit is worthy of her birth her sweetness of the love and respect of all the world her piety of her religion her service of her royal mistress and her beauty and truth of her lord that in short every part of her character is just and that she is the best reward for one of the greatest heros this age has produced this madam is what you must allow people every where to say those whom you shall leave behind you in england will have something further to add the loss we shall suffer by your graces journey to ireland the queens pleasure and the impatient wishes of that nation are about to deprive us of two of our public ornaments but there is no arguing against reasons so prevalent as these those who shall lament your graces absence will yet acquiesce in the wisdom and justice of her majestys choice among all whose royal favors none could be so agreeable upon a thousand accounts to that people as the duke of ormond with what joy what acclamations shall they meet a governor who beside their former obligations to his family has so lately ventured his life and fortune for their preservation what duty what submission shall they not pay to that authority which the queen has delegated to a person so dear to em and with what honor what respect shall they receive your grace when they look upon you as the noblest and best pattern her majesty could send em of her own royal goodness and personal virtues they shall behold your grace with the same pleasure the english shall take when ever it shall be their good fortune to see you return again to your native country in england your grace is become a public concern and as your going away will be attended with a general sorrow so your return shall give as general a joy and to none of those many more than to  madam your graces most obedient and most humble servant n row  prologue spoken by mr betterton long has the fate of kings and empires been the common business of the tragic scene as if misfortune made the throne her seat and none cou d be unhappy but the great dearly it is true each buys the crown he wears and many are the mighty monarchs cares by foreign foes and homebred factions pressed few are the joys he knows and short his hours of rest stories like these with wonder we may hear but far remote and in a higher sphere we never can pity what we never can share like distant battles of the pole and swede which frugal citizens over coffee read careless for who shall fail or who succeed therefore an humbler theme our author chose a melancholy tale of private woes no princes here lost royalty bemoan but you shall meet with sorrows like your own here see imperious love his vassals treat as hardly as ambition does the great see how succeeding passions rage by turns how fierce the youth with joy and rapture burns and how to death for beauty lost he mourns let no nice taste the poets art arraign if some frail vicious characters he feign who writes should still let nature be his care mix shades with lights and not paint all things fair but show you men and women as they are with deference to the fair he bad me say few to perfection ever found the way many in many parts are known to excel but twere too hard for one to act all well whom justly life should through each scene commend the maid

grave compleats its bounty and restores thy name to that high rank and luster which it boasted before ungrateful genoa had forgot the merit of thy godlike fathers arms before that country which he long had served in watchful councils and in winter camps had cast off his white age to want and wretchedness and made their court to faction by his ruin  alt oh great sciolto oh my more than father let me not live but at thy very name my eager heart springs up and leaps with joy when i forget the vast vast debt i owe thee forget but it is impossible then let me forget the use and privilege of

never tell how much  sci it is enough i know thee thou art honest goodness innate and worth hereditary are in thy mind thy noble fathers virtues spring freshly forth and blossom in thy youth  alt thus heaven from nothing raised his fair creation and then with wondrous joy beheld its beauty well pleased to see the excellence he gave  sci oh noble youth i swear since first i knew thee even from that day of sorrows when i saw thee adorned and lovely in thy filial tears the mourner and redeemer of thy father i set thee down and sealed thee for my own thou art my son even near me as calista horatio

thee as they pass thy waiting bride even chides thee for delaying and swears thou come not with a bridegrooms haste  alt oh could i hope there was one thought of altamont one kind remembrance in calistas breast the winds with all their wings would be too slow to bear me to her feet for oh my father amidst this stream of joy that bears me on blessed as i am and honored in your friendship there is one pain that hangs upon my heart  sci what means my son  alt when at your intercession last night calista yielded to my happiness just ere we parted as i sealed my vows with rapture on her lips i found her cold as a dead lovers statue on his tomb a rising storm of passion shook her breast her eyes a piteous shower of tears let fall and then she sighed as if her heart were breaking with all the tenderest eloquence of love i begged to be a sharer in her grief but she with looks averse and eyes that froze me sadly replied her sorrows were her own nor in a fathers power to dispose of  sci away it is the cosenage of their sex one of the common arts they practice on us to sigh and weep then when their hearts beat high with expectation of the coming joy thou have in camps and fighting fields been bred unknowing in the subtleties of women the virgin bride who swoons with deadly fear to see the end of all her wishes near when blushing from the light and public eyes to the kind covert of the night she flies with equal fires to meet the bridegroom moves melts in his arms and with a loose she loves exeunt enter lothario and rossano loath the father and the husband  ross let them pass they saw us not  loath i care not if they did ere long i mean to meet em face to face and gaul em with my triumph over calista  ross you loved her once  loath i liked her would have married her but that it pleased her father to refuse me to make this honorable fool her husband for which if i forget him may the shame i mean to brand his name with stick on mine  ross she gentle soul was kinder than her father  loath she was and often in private gave me hearing till by long listening to the soothing tale at length her easy heart was wholly mine  ross i have heard you often describe her haughty insolent and fierce with high disdain it moves my wonder that virtue thus defended should be yielded a prey to loose desires  loath hear then i will tell thee once in a lone and secret hour of night when every eye was closed and the pale moon and stars alone shone conscious of the theft hot with the tuscan grape and high in blood haply i stole unheeded to her chamber  ross that minute sure was lucky  loath oh twas great i found the fond believing lovesick maid loose unattird warm tender full of wishes fierceness and pride the guardians of her honor were charmed to rest and love alone was waking within her rising bosom all was calm as peaceful seas that know no storms and only are gently lifted up and down by tides i snatched the glorious golden opportunity and with prevailing youthful ardour pressed her till with short sighs and murmuring reluctance the yielding fair one gave me perfect happiness even all the livelong night we past in bliss in ecstasies too fierce to last for ever at length the morn and cold indifference came when fully sated with the luscious banquet i hastily took leave and left the nymph to think on what was past and sigh alone  ross you saw her soon again  loath too soon i saw her for oh that meeting was not like the former i found my heart no more beat high with transport no more i sighed and languishd for enjoyment twas past and reason took her turn to reign while every weakness fell before her throne  ross what of the lady  loath with uneasy fondness she hung upon me wept and sighed and swore she was undone talked of a priest and marriage of flying with me from her fathers power called every saint and blessed angel down to witness for her that she was my wife i started at that name  ross what answer made you  loath none but pretending sudden pain and illness escaped the persecution two nights since by message urged and frequent importunity again i saw her strait with tears and sighs with swelling breasts with swooning with distraction with all the subtleties and powerful arts of wilful woman laboring for her purpose again she told the same dull nauseous tale unmoved i begged her spare the ungrateful subject since i resolved that love and peace of mind might flourish long inviolate betwixt us never to load it with the marriage chain that i would still retain her in my heart my ever gentle mistress and my friend but for those other names of wise and husband they only meant ill nature cares and quarrels  ross how bore she this reply  loath even as the earth when winds pent up or eating fires beneath shaking the mass she labors with destruction at first her rage was dumb and wanted words but when the storm found way twas wild and loud mad as the priestess of the delphick god enthusiastic passion swelled her breast enlarged her voice and ruffled all her form proud and disdainful of the love i proffered she called me villain monster base betrayer at last in very bitterness of soul with deadly imprecations on her self she vowed severely never to see me more then bid me fly that minute i obeyed and bowing left her to grow cool at leisure  ross she has relented since else why this message to meet the keeper of her secrets here this morning  loath see the person whom you named enter lucilla well my embassadress what must we treat of come you to menace war and proud defiance or does the peaceful olive grace your message is your fair mistress calmer does she soften and must we love again perhaps she means to treat in juncture with her new ally and make her husband party to the agreement  lucil is this well done my lord have you put off all sense of human nature keep a little a little pity to distinguish manhood lest other men though cruel should disclaim you and judge you to be numbered with the brutes  loath i see thoust learnt to rail  lucil i have learnt to weep that lesson my sad mistress often gives me by day she seeks some melancholy shade to hide her sorrows from the prying world at night she watches all the long long hours and listens to the winds and beating rain with sighs as loud and tears that fall as fast then ever and anon she wrings her hands and cries false false lothario  loath oh no more i swear thou wilt spoil thy pretty face with crying and thou have beauty that may make thy fortune some keeping cardinal shall dote upon thee and barter his church treasure for thy freshness  lucil what shall i fell my innocence and youth for wealth or titles to perfidious man to man who makes his mirth of our undoing the base professed betrayer of our sex let me grow old in all misfortunes else rather than know the sorrows of calista  loath does she send thee to chide in her behalf i swear thou do it with so good a grace that i could almost love thee for thy frowning  lucil read there my lord there in her own sad lines giving a letter which best can tell the story of her woes that grief of heart which your unkindness gives her lothario

of my eyes waking i dream or i beheld lothario he seemed conferring with calistas woman at my approach they started and retired what business could he have here and with her i know he bears the noble altamont professed and deadly hate  what papers this taking up the letter ha to lothario  s death calistas name opening it confusion and misfortune reads your cruelty has at length determined me and i

will even make thy father curse his age at sight of this black scrowl the gentle altamont for oh i know his heart is set upon thee shall droop and hang his discontented head like merit scorned by insolent authority and never grace the public with his virtues  perhaps even now he gazes fondly on her and thinking soul and body both alike blesses the perfect wormanship of heaven then sighing to his every care speaks peace and bids his heart be satisfied with happiness oh wretched husband while she hangs about thee with idle blandishments and plays the fond one even then her hot imagination wanders contriving riot and loose scapes of love and while she clasps thee close makes thee a monster what if i give this paper to her father it follows that his justice dooms her dead and breaks his heart with sorrow hard return for all the good his hand has heaped on us hold let me take a moments thought  enter lavinia lav my lord trust me it joys my heart that i have found you enquiring wherefore you had left the company before my brothers nuptial rites were ended they told me you had felt some sudden illness where are you sick is it your head your heart tell me my love and ease my anxious thoughts that i may take you gently in my arms sooth you to rest and soften all your pains  hor it were unjust no let me spare my friend lock up the fatal secret in my breast nor tell him that which will undo his quiet  lav what means my lord  hor ha said thou my lavinia  lav alas you know not what you make me suffer why are you pale why did you start and tremble whence is that sigh and wherefore are your eyes severely raised to heaven the sick man thus acknowledging the summons of his fate lifts up his feeble hands and eyes for mercy and with confusion thinks upon his audit  hor oh no thou have mistook my sickness quite these pangs are of the soul would i had met sharpest convulsions spotted pestilences or any other deadly foe to life rather than heave beneath this load of thought  lav alas what is it wherefore turn you from me why did you falsely call me your lavinia and swear i was horatios better half since now you mourn unkindly by your self and rob me of my partnership of sadness witness you holy powers who know my truth there cannot be a chance in life so miserable nothing so very hard but i could bear it much rather than my love should treat me coldly and use me like a stranger to his heart  hor seek not to know what i would hide from all but most from thee i never knew a pleasure ought that was joyful fortunate or good but strait i ran to bless thee with the tidings and laid up all my happiness with thee but wherefore wherefore should i give thee pain then spare me i conjure thee ask no further allow my melancholy thoughts this privilege and let em brood in secret over their sorrows  lav it is enough chide not and all is well forgive me if i saw you sad horatio and asked to weep out part of your misfortunes i wonot press to know what you forbid me yet my loved lord yet you must grant me this forget your cares for this one happy day devote this day to mirth and to your altamont for his dear sake let peace be in your looks even now the jocund bridegroom wants your wishes he thinks the priest has but half blessed his marriage till his friend hails him with the sound of joy  hor oh never never never thou art innocent simplicity from ill pure native truth and candor of the mind adorn thee ever but there are such such false ones in the world twoud fill thy gentle soul wild amazement to hear their story told  lav false ones my lord  hor fatally fair they are and in their smiles the graces little loves and young desires inhabit but all that gaze upon em are undone for they are false luxurious in their appetites and all the heaven they hope for is variety one lover to another still succeeds another and another after that and the last fool is welcome as the former till having loved his hour out he gives place and mingles with the herd that went before him  lav can there be such and have they peace of mind have they in all the series of their changing one happy hour if women are such things how was i formed so different from my sex my little heart is satisfied with you you take up all her room as in a cottage which harbors some benighted princely stranger where the good man proud of his hospitality yields all his homely dwelling to his guest and hardly keeps a corner for himself  hor oh were they all like thee men would adore em and all the business of their lives be loving the nuptial band should be the pledge of peace and all domestic cares and quarrels cease the world should learn to love by virtuous rules and marriage be no more the jest of fools exeunt act ii scene i scene a hall enter calista and lucilla call be dumb for ever silent as the grave nor let thy fond officious love disturb my solemn sadness with the sound of joy if thou will sooth me tell some dismal tale of pining discontent and black despair for oh i have gone around through all my thoughts but all are indignation love or shame and my dear peace of mind is lost for ever  luc why do you follow still that wandering fire that has misled your weary steps and leaves you benighted in a wilderness of woe that false lothario turn from the deceiver turn and behold where gentle altamont kind as the softest virgin of our sex and faithful as the simple village swain that never knew the courtly vice of changing sighs at your feet and wooes you to be happy  call away i think not of him my sad soul has formed a dismal melancholy scene such a retreat as i would wish to find an unfrequented vale oergrown with trees mossie and old within whose lonesome shade ravens and birds ill omend only dwell no sound to break the silence but a brook that bubling winds among the weeds no mark of any human shape that had been there unless a skeleton of some poor wretch who had long since like me by love undone sought that sad place out to despair and die in  luc alas for pity  call there i fain would hide me from the base world from malice and from shame for it is the solemn counsel of my soul never to live with public loss of honor it is fixed to die rather than bear the insolence of each affected she that tells my story and blesses her good stars that she is virtuous to be a tale for fools scorned by the women and pitied by the men oh insupportable  luc can you perceive the manifest destruction the gaping gulf that opens just before you and yet rush on though conscious of the danger oh hear me hear your ever faithful creature by all the good i wish by all the ill my trembling heart forebodes let me entreat you never to see this faithless man again let me forbid his coming  call on thy life i charge thee no my genius drives me on i must i will behold him once again perhaps it is the crisis of my fate and this one enterview shall end my cares my laboring heart that swells with indignation heaves to discharge the burden that once done the busy thing shall rest within its cell and never beat again  luc trust not to that rage is the shortest passion of our souls like narrow brooks that rise with sudden showers it swells in haste and falls again as soon still as it ebbs the softer thoughts flow in and the deceiver love supplies its place  call i have been wronged enough to arm my temper against the smooth delusion but alas chide not my weakness gentle maid but pity me a womans softness hangs about me still then let me blush and tell thee all my folly i swear i could not see the dear betrayer kneel at my feet and sigh to be forgiven but my relenting heart would pardon all and quite forget twas he that had undone me  lucil ye sacred powers whose gracious providence is watchful for our good guard me from men from their deceitful tongues their vows and flatteries still let me pass neglected by their eyes let my bloom wither and my form decay that none may think it worth his while to ruin me and fatal love may never be my bane  call ha altamont calista now be wary and guard thy souls accesses with dissembling nor let this hostile husbands eyes explore the warring passions and tumultuous thoughts that rage within thee and deform thy reason  enter altamont alt be gone my cares i give you to the winds far to be born far from the happy altamont for from this sacred era of my love a better order of succeeding days come smiling forward white and lucky all calista is the mistress of the year she crowns the seasons with auspicious beauty and bids even all my hours be good and joyful  call if i was ever mistress of such happiness oh wherefore did i play the unthrifty fool and wasting all on others leave my self without one thought of joy to give me comfort  alt oh mighty love shall that fair face profane this thy great festival with frowns and sadness i swear it sha not be for i will woo thee with sighs so moving with so warm a transport that thou shall catch the gentle flame from me and kindle into joy  call i tell thee altamont such hearts as ours were never paired above ill suited to each other joined not matched some sullen influence a foe to both has wrought this fatal marriage to undo us mark but the frame and temper of our minds how very much we differ even this day that fills thee with such ecstasy and transport to me brings nothing that should make me bless it or think it better than the day before or any other in the course of time that dully took its turn and was forgotten  alt if to behold thee as my pledge of happiness to know none fail none excellent beside thee if still to love thee with unwearied constancy through every season every change of life through wrinkled age through sickness and misfortune be worth the least return of grateful love oh then let my calista bless this day and set it down for happy  call it is the day in which my father gave my hand to altamont as such i will remember it for ever  enter sciolto horatio and lavinia sci let mirth go on let pleasure know no pause but fill up every minute of this day it is yours my children sacred to your loves the glorious sun himself for you looks gay he shines for altamont and for calista let there be music let the master touch the sprightly string and softlybreathing flute till harmony rouse every gentle passion teach the cold maid to lose her fears in love and the fierce youth to languish at her feet begin even age it self is cheered with music it wakes a glad remembrance of our youth calls back past joys and warms us into transport  here an entertainment of music and dancing song by mr gongreve i ah stay ah turn ah whither would you fly too charming too relentless maid i follow not to conquer but to die you of the fearful are afraid ii in vain i call for she like fleeting air when pressed by some tempestuous wind flies swifter from the voice of my despair nor casts one pitying look behind sci take care my gates be open bid all welcome all who rejoice with me to day are friends let each indulge his genius each be glad jocund and free and swell the feast with mirth the sprightly bowl shall cheerfully go round none shall be grave nor too severely wise losses and disappointments cares and poverty the rich mans insolence and great mans scorn in wine shall be forgotten all tomorrow will be too soon to think and to be wretched oh grant ye powers that i may see these happy pointing to alt and calista completely blessed and i have life enough and leave the rest indifferently to fate exeunt manet horatio hor what if while all are here intent on revelling i privately went forth and sought lothario this letter may be forged perhaps the wantonness of his vain youth to stain a ladys fame perhaps his malice to disturb my friend oh no my heart forebodes it must be true methought even now i marked the starts of guilt that shook her soul though damned dissimulation skrcend her dark thoughts and set to public view a specious face of innocence and beauty oh false appearance what is all our sovereignty our boasted power when they oppose their arts still they prevail and we are found their fools with such smooth looks and many a gentle word the first fair she beguiled her easy lord too blind with love and beauty to beware he fell unthinking in the fatal snare nor could believe that such a heavenly face had bargained with the devil to damn her wretched race exit scene ii scene the street near scioltos palace enter lothario and rossano loath to tell thee then the purport of my thoughts the loss of this fond paper would not give me a moment of disquiet were it not my instrument of vengeance on this altamont therefore i mean to wait some opportunity of speaking with the maid we saw this morning  ross i wish you sir to think upon the danger of being seen to day their friends are round em and any eye that lights by chance on you shall put your life and safety to the hazard they confer aside enter horatio hor still i must doubt some mystery of mischief some artifice beneath lotharios father i knew him well he was sagacious cunning fluent in words and bold in peaceful councils but of a cold unactive hand in war yet with these cowards virtues he undid my unsuspecting valiant honest friend this son if fame mistakes not is more hot more open and unartful  ha he is here seeing him  loath damnation he again  this second time to day he has crossed me like my evil genius  hor i sought you sir  loath it is well then i am found  hor it is well you are the man who wrongs my friend to the earths utmost verge i would pursue no place though ever so holy should protect him no shape that artful fear ever formed should hide him till he fair answer made and did me justice  loath ha do thou know me that i am lothario as great a name as this proud city boasts of who is this mighty man then this horatio that i should basely hide me from his anger lest he should chide me for his friends displeasure  hor the brave it is true do never shun the light just are their thoughts and open are their tempers freely without disguise they love and hate still are they found in the fair face of day and heaven and men are judges of their actions  loath such let em be of mine there is not a purpose which my soul ever framed or my hand acted but i could well have bid the world look on and what i once durst do have dared to justify  hor where was this open boldness this free spirit when but this very morning i surpised thee in base dishonest privacy consulting and bribing a poor mercenary wretch to sell her ladys secrets stain her honor and with a forged contrivance blast her virtue at sight of me thou fledst  loath ha fled from thee  hor thou fledst and guilt was on thee like a thief a pilferer descried in some dark corner who there had lodged with mischievous intent to rob and ravage at the hour of rest and do a midnight murder on the sleepers  loath slave villain  offers to draw rossano holds him ross hold my lord think where you are think how unsafe and hurtful to your honor it were to urge a quarrel in this place and shock the peaceful city with a broil  loath then since thou do provoke my vengeance know i would not for this citys wealth for all which the sea wafts to our ligurian shore but that the joys i reaped with that fond wanton the wife of altamont should be as public as is the noonday sun air earth or water or any common benefit of nature think thou i meant the shame should be concealed oh no by hell and vengeance all i wanted was some fit messenger to bear the news to the dull doting husband now i have found him and thou art he  hor i hold thee base enough to break through law and spurn at sacred order and do a brutal injury like this yet mark me well young lord i think calista too nice too noble and too great of soul to be the prey of such a thing as thou art twas base and poor unworthy of a man to forge a scrowl so villainous and loose and mark it with a noble ladys name these are the mean dishonest arts of cowards strangers to manhood and to glorious dangers who bred at home in idleness and riot ransack for mistresses the unwholesome stews and never know the worth of virtuous love  loath think thou i forged the letter think so still till the broad shame comes staring in thy face and boys shall hoot the cuckold as he passes  hor away no woman could descend so low a skipping dancing worthless tribe you are fit only for your selves you herd together and when the circling glass warms your vain hearts you talk of beauties that you never saw and fancy raptures that you never knew legends of saints who never yet had being or being never were saints are not so false as the fond tales which you recount of love  loath but that i do not hold it worth my leisure i could produce such damning proof   hor it is false you blast the fair with lies because they scorn you hate you like age like ugliness and impotence rather than make you blessed they would die virgins and stop the propagation of mankind  loath it is the curse of fools to be secure and that be thine and altamonts dream on or think upon my vengeance till thou feelst it  hor hold sir another word and then farewell though i think greatly of calistas virtue and hold it far beyond thy power to hurt yet as she shares the honor of my altamont that treasure of a soldier

horror are fit to feed the frenzy in my soul here is room for meditation even to madness till the mind burst with thinking this dull flame sleeps in the socket sure the book was left to tell me something  for instruction then  he teaches holy sorrow and contrition and penitence  is it become an art then a trick that lazy dull luxurious gownmen can teach us to do over i will no more on it throwing away the book i have more real anguish in my heart than all their pedant discipline ever knew what charnel has been rifled for these bones fie this is pageantry  they look uncoothly but what

could gather for thee by cares on earth and by my prayers to heaven were little for my fondness to bestow why did thou turn to folly then and curse me  call because my soul was rudely drawn from yours

woman  sci had thou been honest thou had been a cherubin but of that joy as of a gem long lost beyond redemption gone think we no more have thou ever dared to meditate on death  call i have as on the end of shame and sorrow  sci ha answer me say have thou cooly thought it is not the stoicks lessons got by rote the pomp of words and pedant dissertations that can sustain thee in that hour of terror
