a preliminary introduction to the act of seabathing wherein is shown its nature power and importance with some necessary hints for the attention of visiters at the watering places previous to and during a course of bathing  by john anderson md fas cm etc physician to and a director of the general seabathing infirmary at margate  margate  printed for c dilly in the poultry and e murray fleet street london to be had at the libraries margate ramsgate and broadstairs        preliminary introduction to seabathing it may be proper to inform the reader that in compliance with the request of some highly distinguished gentlemen of the faculty i have undertaken to write on the nature power influence and effect of seawater and seabathing cold and hot and submitted the manuscripts to be read before a learned medical society in london and also to be reviewed by sundry learned medical friends and the reports on them are highly flattering but which it may be prudent to conceal till the public opinion is known  the subject matter thus assigned me to sift and handle is sufficiently interesting and stands in much need of farther investigation seabathing is certainly more practiced at the present day than a knowledge of it is yet possessed there is in it great room to advance explain enforce and restrain what i deliver shall though connected be in distinct tracts in order to relieve the reader and make them come easy to the purchaser the whole will be the result of long practical experience and the facts supported by respectable living evidence of gentlemen of the faculty on the coast and longstanding sagacious seabathing guides male and female at margate where any thing is left doubtful or equivocal it is for professional men resident at the seawatering places to advance a step farther and add to and refine on my arguments and the importance of the design and by their being thus faithful interpreters of the hidden treasures of nature will manifest themselves to be what they profess the guardians of health and the truly adopted sons and heirs of apollo the inventor of medicine divisum sic breve fiet opus none else are or can be competent to the task as seabathing involves in it a knowledge of the animal economy and of general medical practice founded on just physical reasoning call it theory if you will experience without nice conception of the truths necessary demonstrable by reason to enable us to draw just deductions from the phenomena for application to particular objects is no experience at all it is worse than none for it involves in obscurity and fixes an idea in the mind narrow in its compass hazardous in the enterprise and often false in the conclusion so that it brings nothing to the temple of truth and knowledge and neither promotes completes or actuates to new inventions or any useful discovery of the several dependencies causes and connection of things so far as comes within the ken of human intelligence all theory beyond this is as vain and fruitless as that of simple curs barking and leaping after the wild birds of the sky or at the light of and specks in the moon there is not the same libertas philosophica in ars medica as in licentia poetica for the flights of fancy as speculative literature is baseless our faith is left free nothing less than solid truth can be rested on it is the great barrier against the floods of error ignorance and skeptical hypothesis or fictious sophistry in truth there is certitude of what is good or bad in ignorance diffidence doubt and danger  so want of knowing truth does fools delude and error from the right way does exclude all those that doubt  horace the stoics esteem him mad who is blindly led by ignorance instead of truth diffidence and obstinacy though opposite in themselves are both in the line of defection diffidence is no just excuse for the concealment of an important fact others may theorize thereon theory helps us out in the knowledge of reasons and causes for settling our judgments upon the best and most rational principles  theory and practice like two heavenly bodies attract light on each other the one without the other is like the statue of polyphemus without an eye or a lamp without oil every man has some theory or other  good or bad  his cannot be wrong whose practice is uniformly successful it is in full proof if actions are allowed to be stronger than words in strict logic it is not allowed to pass from the hypothesis to the thesis the hypothetical principle must be proved before the consequences can be admitted opinion must be implanted or resolution determined before reasons for that opinion can be known illustration and just representation by example is required to enlighten and instruct the understanding or the truth of a doctrine cannot be confirmed or its principles established sir isaac newton says as in mathematics so in natural philosophy the investigation of difficult things by way of analysis ought ever to precede the method of composition this analysis consists in making experiments and observations and in drawing general conclusions from them by induction and admitting of no objections against the conclusions but such as are taken from experiments and observations or other certain truths and although the arguing from experiments and observations by induction be no demonstration of general conclusions yet it is the best way of reasoning which the nature of things admit of and may be looked upon as so much the stronger by how much the induction is more general and if no exception occur from phenomena the conclusion may be pronounced generally but if at any time afterward any exceptions do occur from experiments it may be pronounced with such exceptions as shall occur by this way of analysis we may proceed from compounds to ingredients and from motions to the forces producing them and in general from effects to their causes and from particular causes to more general ones till the argument ends in the most general op p   0 l     the theory required founded on the light of nature concerning man his diseases affections bodily and mental dependencies mutations diversisications resistances sympathies and antipathies indicating and contraindicating symptoms concordant and discordant opinions and principles together with the force and influence of the planetary system on our orb is infinite obscure and mavelous to human wisdom yet does honor to the eternal immutable being who has not only created but preserves the variety there is nothing without its counteracting opponent there is no disease without its antidote vice has virtue hatred love malevolence charity  theorists oppose and by their opposing opinions truth comes out and the arts and sciences are refined and improved this system of opposition is maintained throughout the whole animal and vegetable creation all nature is but art unknown to thee all chance direction which thou can not see all discord harmony not understood all partial evil universal good and spite of pride in erring reasons spite one truth is clear whatever is is right pope  all theories may be referred to the general laws of motion seabathing comprehends in it the powers and qualities of fluidity gravity pressure attraction repulsion stimulation friction attrition and velocity cold heat humidity dryness effluvia etc  if what i offer to the public shall meet with a reception equal to the intention to awaken and persuade my fellow creatures upon rational grounds to keep out of the road that leads to pain sorrow and premature death and embrace health that inestimable blessing which gives relish to all our enjoyments my ambition will be amply gratified in being permitted to add my mite to the public fund of preservatory knowledge  although i write from the locality of my situation yet the observations i have made the important facts i have industriously collected and the dubious points i have more fully ascertained are so general as to serve equally well for every other eligible seabathing place at home or abroad  neither the advantages of seabathing at margate nor the salubrious property of the air of thanet have hitherto commanded medical attention equal to what their importance deserve consequently are not sufficiently known to the public res ipsa loquitur seabathing has certainly worked its own way more than by any industry of the saculty  during twelve years and upwards that i resided at kingston surry before i came to margate though i was allowed to be fortunate under heaven in relieving pain and distress yet i wish to throw a veil over my ignorance of the power and effects of seabathing as of those i recommended to it some returned no better some worse and some i sent to the cold seabath whom i ought to have sent to the warm et vice versa which i heartily acknowledged in my medical remarks the moment i knew better wherefore there is but too much room to conclude that all those who returned benefitted were more indebted to chance than to any precise judgment or theory of mine i have to plead for it i was an inland practiser when all my knowledge of it was derived from the very few practical treatises i had seen or could obtain on the subject and neither of those i saw were so perfect as to give me adequate ideas of it for practice some in some things egregiously misled me some others were misled themselves and it making no part of academical education my mind was not prompted to consider the efficacy of seawater as any thing beyond that of a mere wash for a foul skin whereas there is no part i will say of the whole materia medica yet known so extensively efficacious under judicious direction or detrimental under indiscreet illtimed management if it was not capable of doing harm it would be incapable of doing good  in those simples which dwell the most virulent poisons dwell also the most potent salutary virtues there is some soul goodness in things evil would men observingly distill it out shakespeare  the most capital things of nature lie generally out of the common track and therefore the man who aims at great and useful discovery must take much upon himself for few will follow until the point is fully ascertained and it is well if he does not meet with discouragement for his diligent inquiry  in proportion to our confidence proficiency and enlarged views of nature so are the miseries of mankind abridged and the means are multiplied for yielding a comfortable existence it is for me and for every one of us who undertake the important charge of lives to open and expand our ideas for receiving more ample and more enlarged views of the discoverable things of nature her silent ways the dispensations of providence and the exigencies of man which if every one did we should see fewer improper objects arrive at the seawatering places with very inadequate directions and large packages of compounded drugs which no rational practitioner physician or apothecary can act with and under by which some have severely suffered others received no benefit and the water forsooth blamed for what it had no hand in lamentabili dictu  none have fuffered at margate except the indiscreet and unthinking or who have been so unfortunate as to be badly advised and injudiciously directed no matter whether by those on the coast or inland who have not yet acquired a competent knowledge of the state qualities powers order affinity and appropriation of the objects of nature to the seminal and radical causes of distemper or the patients ability of body to sustain the proposed means for receiving relief  i have observed some to have come and under judicious direction receive much benefit come a second time resting on their own judgment and experience and suffer  those who are dead and insensible to all the warm emotions and pleasing sensations that result from the act of selfpreservation  the amor sui  we cannot expect to resuscitate i say with horace let none but learned doctors physic give let each mechanic by his calling live   and with pliny the arts would be happy if only artists might judge of them and practice them  by an improper application of seabathing through ignorance the intention of the bath is frustrated the symptoms of a complaint aggravated new fatal ones brought on and the voice of nature is silenced that eloquent and much enlightened genius the late dr john morgan professor of medicine in the college of philadelphia in his anniversary discourse published in      has the following spirited passage which does honor to his humanity  should we says he for a moment turn our eyes upon the man who dares to enter upon the practice of physic without being properly initiated into the science or instructed in the important duties of the profession he would soon present us with a melancholy prospect if not past all feelings of humanity what compunctions of conscience what remorse would not fill his breast from practicing at random and in the dark not knowing whether his prescriptions might prove a wholesome remedy or a destructive poison to discover the nature of an uncommon disease or to account for an unusual symptom puzzles his invention  ignorant of every true principle from which by just reasoning he might be able to deduce practical inferences he knows not what prognostic to make or what plan of treatment to observe  unsteady and irresolute he attempts a variety of means such as either avail not or such as heighten the danger of the disease already too violent he may thus interrupt the salutary attempts of nature or not knowing how to second them tamper with the life of the patient and idly waiting to see what nature herself is capable of doing neglect to succor her till it is too late and the fatal hand of death is just closing the gloomy scene  wretched is the case of those whom chance or misinformed judgment shall throw into his hands to fall victims of his temerity  great is the havoc which his ignorance spreads on every side robbing the affectionate husband of his darling spouse or rendering the tender wife a helpless widow  increasing the number of orphans  mercilessly depriving them of their parents support  bereaving the afflicted parents of their only comfort and hope by the untimely death of their beloved infants and laying whole families desolate remorseless so to human kind actuated by more than savage cruelty hold hold thy exterminating hand   glad should i be to moderate this too exact description of the effects of ignorant and presumptuous practice but what judgment can we pass on those who have been scarcely instructed in the first elements of medical science and yet force themselves into practice as if they meant to sport themselves with human life and human calamities  if medicine be allowed to be a great blessing in the hands of the sagacious and wise and as a sword in the hands of the foolish and furious so is seabathing too much being assumed and taken for granted is the reason so little progress has hitherto been made in its theory for guiding the hand of practice the greatest enemy to wisdom and prudence is precipitation  nine years ago i happened to come to marcate in quest of strength after a long and severe fever and receiving a very sensible benefit the first season by seabathing and the salubrious air of thanet i was thereon led to make inquiry into their special effects on other visitors and what i actually saw and was credibly informed of by some of the bathing guides i thought important and it not being generally known i immediately published it in my medical remarks on evacuations since that time i have had frequent opportunity of observing more minutely their effects on others under various states circumstances and conditions of body in simple and complicated acute and chronic casual and inherent complaints and every years experience gives manifold proofs of their very great utility to health they restore and preserve there are but few distempers incident to human nature in which either the cold the warm or vapor seawater bath and the air of a salubrious spot on the margin of the main such as thanet are not equal to meet and prove more or less beneficial in i have seen on a well directed course diseases not only palliated but many cured by them after having baffled the power of medicine in rational artists hands these baths are certainly most excellent auxiliaries to medicine diet exercise and amusement as these are to them which accounts for the great flux and reflux of company from the king to the beggar to and from the seawatering places during the temperate seasons where baths give vigor and the waters health  or as a late ingenious margate visitant to mount parnassus describes it the briny wave does thousands save alike from grave and crutches makes aged young the feeble strong or beggar duke or duchess coleman  seawater is not a mere simple homogeneous elemental fluid simplex simplicitur but natures richly saturated compound it contains say chemical philosophers a muriatic bitter purging salt calcarious earth and sulphurous bitumen and boil and other naturalists agree in there being a subtle aetherial spirit in water which some call fixed air some phlogiston or inflammable air besides a pure air which airs become elastic as seen by the sparkling air bubbles  the proportion of the principles of seawater vary in some distant seas and in deep and in shallow water some say the sea is more salt in summer than in winter warmer in a tempest than in a calm there is in seawater besides its original native principles the impregnation of submarine plants such as the quercus marinus or seawreck and other plants the slime sperm and excrementitious parts of fishes their and other dead bodies rain dew hail snow springs and the disemboguing of rivers and ponds together with fossils minerals and the refuse of ships etc the combination of all which heterogeneous particles render seawater on stagnation and being close kept quickly corruptible after a long calm at sea the stench is very offensive and that which issues forth on opening a cask of seawater that has been kept for some time in the hold of a ship is intolerable nay deadly if it were not for the tides there would be no living near the sea in a calm as the aerial spirit in waters is extremely fugitive they are all better drank on the spot than at a distance and the more they are crowded with their principles they spoil the sooner  the seabeach on the coast of thanet is made up of fine sand intermixed with chalk that breaks off from the cliffs after intense long continued frost and is melted by the flowing tides those cliffs that gave to britain the ancient name of albion that pale that whitefaced shore whose foot spurns back the oceans roaring tides shakespeare  thus there is a bottom that is remarkably clean soft smooth yet invariably firm and gently sloping from the fending banks which render thanets coast very inviting to bathe  the seawater at margate is not only pure but strong of its native principles by reason no rivers run into the ocean to make it muddy and brackish nearer than the thames and medway both thirty miles to the westward and these repelled back again by the flood tide  the first three or four years i stood a mere spectator and inquirer into the power influence and effects of seabathing before ever i thought myself competent to direct a course of it it was to me a new study though an ancient practice for homer tells us that ulysses and his comrades bathed in warm water and in the sea to refresh themselves after fatigue before they dined he mentions purifyng the atrides in the sea  although we have the testimony and suffrage of some of the greatest philosophers and sage physicians in the different ages of the world for the cold spring and soft tepid baths being the most universal remedies in the whole compass of nature yet in a medicinal light they are far very far inferior in efficacy to the warm and cold seawater baths only they are not so convenient or so easy for all at all times to come at if few speak for few speak against them because they are not competent of their power and effects and if they are not of their ill as well as good we cannot take their silence to be suffrage  at first i met with much difficulty in obtaining intelligence for the faculty and the seabathing guides at margate all told me they never had been put on the line of observing for if they had they said they could have furnished me with many important facts of the power and effect both good and ill of seabathing they build on sands which unmoved they find it is because there was no wind cowley  and my not meeting with a scrip on the subject in any of the libraries that afforded me the least satisfaction i had to persevere in wading through thick shades of darkness till i came into fair light when i clearly saw the impropriety of their receiving all that came without exeeption as if seabathing was an universal sovereign specific remedy for all complaints whatever were their nature or cause was proper at all times and suited to all constitutions temperaments states and conditions of body modes of living and that by one mode of bathing only and of pushing the bath indiscriminately beyond what nature can bear can there be any error theoretical or practical more absurd or unphilosophical art is subservient to nature to relieve polish and improve nature if nature and art do not go hand in hand and mutually accord nothing will be perfected or established in any art or science nature will be led but not driven  although many discoveries are made in natural history yet many are still to make and the point of view necessary to place many things in for a just application is still much wanting defective and but imperfectly understood this we may apply to seabathing as much as to any part of medical practice when we talk of seabathing being efficacious in this or in that complaint we must mean to comprehend with it the state and condition of body at the time it has to operate upon the cold spring and soft tepid baths may almost wholly be referred to strictum and laxum even the sainted wells in which they are very powerful  having seven years ago cautioned the margate bathing guides against receiving any ailing persons except with and by the suffrage of the faculty and the guides themselves seeing the ppriety of this from some unfortunate accidents that happened that season and before to improper and unprepared persons to some of whom i had been called but too late in some instances for t to restore i have not seen or heard of any since suffering violence by seabathing i had no other way to prevent embarrassment that might in future acrue to ignorant and misled persons the guides were not to blame they were not competent and their bread depends wholly on the multiplicity that bathe we must rather impute to visitors themselves neglecting to apply for proper advice on the spot which the poorest person that comes recommended may have the french have a true saying of the english in respect to their health which is that they do not think themselves sick soon enough and they think themselves well too soon  notwithstanding of the many drawbacks on seabathing whilst the bountiful ocean answers the peremptory demands of thousands and tens of thousands of proper claiments every year it must ever be solicited aad embraced by the sons and daughters of affliction still it is no universal panacea its gifts are by no means appropriated for or dispensed to all nor are all applicants equally capable of receiving them there neither is or can be any universal remedy to supersede all the other parts of gods creation  do away all degrees of comparison  invert the order of nature and leave nothing for the inquiry intelligence or employment of man take but degree away unhinge that string and hark what discord follows each thing meets in mere appugnancy shakespeare  a generous cordial to a person fainting and satigued is a comfortable reviving thing but fiery ardent spirit to one with a hot stomach and inflamed blood is adding fuel to the fire or like giving a man a soporiferous draught in a lethargy how often alas have i seen the misery of a disorder thus confirmed by injudicious illtimed administration that a judicious physician would by quite an opposite treatment have easily subdued how often on the other hand have i rejoicingly beheld many a valuable life that had been dispaired of by one set of men restored speedily by others who attended more minutely to the nice discriminating circumstances of nature for facilitating the means she uses in her conflict with death though fifteen or twenty years since some of these live useful members of society yet how few are these comparatively speaking to the number of drowned persons restored annually to life by the humane society after vital action in the heart arteries and respiratory organs had for almost an incredible length of time been suspended and also to the number of great cures performed in our hospitals after the complaints had baffled the art of sagacious private practisers which shows the advantage of art where rational men of the faculty have strict justice done to their practice  hoc est vivere bis posse priore frui every instance of resuscitation corroborates to serve as a spur to us not to abandon nature too soon in her difficulties when we every day see what she is capable of doing for giving relief in distress with a little judicious welltimed help but though the benignant hand of providence continues to anticipate on many occasions the interposition of art by effecting her own work yet men of judgment understanding experience and observation know that she is frequently interrupted and retarded therein by the officious hands of ignorance temerity and professional juglers  an honest mans the noblest work of god perseverence in doing good to our distressed fellow creatures is the crown and perfection of all virtues every other principle of virtue attends it if there are any ulcered souls that think this a burden or a drawback on trade let not their judgment counteract or silence the voice of nature  the will of their creator and preserver let them consider if the world was made for caesar it was for titus too  those only who are in familiar habits with nature can know any thing of her ways and the methods she takes in causing and carrying off disease and purifying the blood of noxious particles that associate with the mass and bear down the fabric the art is not to render the blood by the remedy in a worse state than it found it which every medicine will do if injudiciously used and the most potent one too the soonest  to treat a disease rationally it is not only necessary to know the remedy but the natural constitution and acquired diathesis of the blood it has to act upon the sagacious physician has many signs and tokens given him for his guide in the local and universal complaint even the aspect of the countenance on the bed of sickness serves to enable him to make a genuine presage of the issue this is called the semiotic or art of presaging by exterior signs the disease constitution state and natures indications salutary and erroneous being known she instantly presents to his enlightened mind what is calculated for opposing the morbid symptoms and bringing relief out of the abundant stock from his extensive researches under the protection of an allattentive providence without being tossed on the fluctuating wave of conjectural opinion or uncertainty thus experience founded on analogy and comparative fact imparts her observations to reason and enables it to support by fair evidence solid conclusions against the common enemy ignorance which saps the foundation and undermines all genuine learning example has the force of command  scientific principles certainly rest on praecognita fixed leading or standing selfevident axioms which are the objects of our senses  come within the sphere or cognizance of our intellectual faculties and are consistent with reason and truth on these science is enlarged and improved medical science being the most extensive of any it taking in the whole compass and domain of nature many things are yet beyond the amplitude of our intellectual view and therefore its supporting pillars cannot all be reckoned and our philosophy has not taught us to reduce infinite variety to difinite limitation without loss how narrow and unstable all the systems of medical theory yet extant every one having been so sullied by the improvements of the succeeding generation that there is not one that has yet stood the test of half a century hippocrates pater noster arts medicoe excepted which will stand as long as nature is true to herself upon it we may make new acquests every day it having endless store to improve on but upon none else that i know how short and fluctuating the college catalogue of remedies to natures plan of the materia medica as if all the rest beyond it were an useless mass of rubbish only fit for being cast away while deus et natura nihil faeiunt frustra cicero in his academicks speaks almost in these words i do not direct my thoughts to the little bear but the great bear called helice or charles wain those famous seven north stars that is my ideas are to be enlarged not narrowed and therefore i must wander and expatiate a great deal farther absolute restriction is giving at once an effectual check to the spirit of inquiry and locking up the human understanding in the dark vale of ignorance the most enlightened genius with every advantage knows but in part and all that physicians do or can know of nature may be resolved into principles of observation and physical fact their researches and disquisitions into occult and inscrutable paths such as primordial efficient causes and inbred virtues or to unravel that combination of causes which we call chance more especially supernatural causes and their influences would be fruitless vain arrogant and bewildering if not irreverent that being nature itself and nature is the art of the godhead  the dark profundity of heavens high plan is known to angels but concealed from man it is well if we can obtain a side glance or a passing smile  though much remains to be discovered before we arrive at the ne plus ultra yet enough is discovered of things and their virtues to enable the human mind to form just ideas of the infinite wisdom power justice and goodness of the great god of universal nature whose benificence pours forth and discloses his blessings to every living thing conducted by fixed and immutable laws and the rule and order of his dispensation is the felicity of the universe  in every flower that blooms or shrub that grows the godhead smiles triumphant over his foes or as lucretius more fully has it god is in sea and land and air and sky what would we more all is deity whatever we see or wheresoeer we go we must see god whether we will or no   after what is said in this preliminary discourse it will appear evident to the rational reader that inasmuch as it is for physicians and their brethren of the faculty at the seawatering places to explore and industriously acquire a competent knowledge of the nature power influence and effect of seabathing and its essential supporting auxilliaries for the relief of pain agony and distress it is for visitors themselves not to be too indolent or refractory to taking and being guided by reason and judicious counsel on the spot not only previous to but from time to time during a course of bathing to prevent embarrassment and to allow the bath to have fair play for answering the end and intention of it for no writer can lay down rules to answer all and every ones case invariably therefore to act laudably and gain success is the triumph of wisdom it is the way to be acquainted with nature know all the good that individuals find or god or nature meant to mere mankind reasons whole pleasure all the joys of sense lie in three words health peace and competence pope  end of the introduction published by
