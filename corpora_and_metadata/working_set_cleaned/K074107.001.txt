will walk before the lord in the land of the living man is a being of a compound nature he consists of a soul and a body by the former he is allied to god and angels by the latter to earth and earthly things in consequence of this he is capable of two different sorts of enjoyments subjected to two distinct classes of desires and lives at once in two dissimilar states from the body arise appetites for worldly things and pleasure in them from the soul desires of things spiritual and eternal and a relish for them we live an animal or a natural life and we live at the same time a rational or spiritual life thus by the very constitution of our nature our attention is drawn different ways our views are directed to contrary objects and we are engaged in dissimilar employments by concern about the one we may become negligent of the other  the things of this world are the objects of sense they are continually soliciting our notice they force themselves into our view they affect us strongly by these means they are very apt to render us regardless of spiritual and eternal things which can be perceived only by faith which make but a weak impression on the thoughtless which cannot influence our conduct except we set ourselves voluntarily and designedly to meditate upon them while we are intent on our occupations for the support of the animal life we may very readily fall into neglect with respect to that occupation which belongs to us as reasonable and immortal creatures we should guard against this with a care proportioned to the danger of our becoming guilty of it  the scripture perpetually inculcates upon us that the eternal happiness of our souls and the practice of holiness by which it is secured ought to be our principal concern and to engage us more earnestly than any of the possessions and enjoyments which can profit us only in the present life or any of those worldly employments which are subservient to the attainment of them the least reflection is sufficient to convince us of the propriety and the importance of this conduct to those who at all think seriously the difficulty lies only in preserving a commanding impression of the necessity of this conduct and putting it in practice amidst the busy scenes and the diffipations of common life these frequently obliterate the conviction and efface the sentiments which are produced by the most affecting representations of the superior value of spiritual and eternal things exhibited in an hour of retirement and devotion  it is of great moment therefore to acquire a striking sense of the manner in which a concern for the salvation of our souls and application to the duties of religion may be intermingled with our whole worldly employment and exerted in the various circumstances of ordinary life for discoursing on this subject we may naturally take occasion from the words now read i will walk says david before the lord in the land of the living to walk before the lord genesis xvii   xxiv  0 xlviii      kings iii     kings xx   pro lv     and to walk with the lord genesis v       vi   mich vi   mal ii    are beautiful expressions used in scripture on purpose to convey this very view of religion and the former of them conveys it the more explicitly in this place by the psalmists having added in the land of the living by these last words he no doubt designed to express the constancy of that obedience to god which he promised in return for the mercies acknowledged in this psalm he meant to intimate that he would persist in it to the end of his life but they likewise naturally imply that he would incorporate his religion with his whole ordinary life and make it to run through all the occupations in which he might ever be employed in common with other men and to blend itself with all the transactions relative to the present world in which he might be at any time engaged it is certain that the scriptures always suppose religion to be connected with common life and designed for influencing us in all the affairs of it they never represent it as a thing which may be laid aside when we come into the world or for which we have no occasion while we are busied in the labor of our stations  to consider religion in this important point of view as what ought to mix with all our secular employments and give a tincture and complexion to all those actions which have the most intimate relation to the present animal life is what i now propose  by setting religion in this light i do not mean to affirm that it contains no duties distinct from the right conduct of our ordinary business or that there are no exercises belonging to it which are abstracted from common life there are times and seasons appropriated to particular religious duties into which no concern about our ordinary business should be allowed to intrude there are assemblies called together for partaking in the sacraments for public worship and for hearing the word where we must be intent on these exercises alone and whence we must exclude all worldly thoughts and cares there are exercises of devotion which must be performed in the secresy and stillness of retirement prayer the reading of the scriptures meditation on the principles of religion and the obligations of our several duties selfexamination confession of our sins and resolutions of amendment we are not truly religious if we allow concern for our temporal interests and diligence in our worldly business to lead us into the neglect of these they have not an immediate relation to the employments of our stations but they are consistent with them they suspend them for a little but they can be performed without any inconvenient interruption of them these duties of religion enter not directly into common life nor are intimately incorporated with its functions they are rather in appearance abstracted from them but they are in reality subservient to the right discharge of them they form impressions which may influence us in life they revive sentiments which without them the hurry of business would dissipate they invigorate principles of conduct which the avocations of the world would enfeeble but which the good man must act upon every day without attendance on these duties of religion we could have no good sentiments or principles to carry into the world with us but we attend upon them to no purpose if we carry not into the world with us if we maintain not amidst all the bustle of the world the good sentiments and principles which they are fitted to infuse the church and the closet are the places where these duties are performed but the world is the place where we must display the effects which they produce and exert the temper of holiness which they cherish the spiritual life must be recruited by the exercises of retirement and retreat but when it is recruited by these as the nourishment adaped to it it is in the world that it must show its vigor its functions must mix themselves with all those of the animal life our employment for eternity must be interwoven with all our occupations for time  in the sequel i shall first point out the importance of this view of religion and secondly explain it  first i shall point out the importance of considering religion as connected with all the parts of our ordinary life  there is no mistake about the nature of religion more dangerous than an opinion that it is inconsistent or even unconnected with the ordinary business of life this opinion will produce different effects on different persons but all the effects which it can produce will be pernicious  if it be entertained it will infallibly lead the generality to neglect religion altogether present things are so constantly in our view the wants and the demands of the natural life are felt so strongly that most men will be engrossed by them if they apprehend that without neglecting them they cannot secure future and unseen things did all men perceive clearly that they may walk with god while they are mixing in the societies and employments of men and that they may most effectually promote their eternal happiness while they are occupied in the business of their temporal vocations many would endeavor to work out their salvation phil ii     who scarcely think of it because they imagine it unconnected with their ordinary business or incompatible with their worldly pursuits  some however have so deep a sense of the importance of their eternal interests and so strong a solicitude to secure them that an opinion of their inconsistence with the business and pursuits of life will drive them into the opposite extreme under the influence of this mistake many have secluded themselves from the world withdrawn from all the occupations of life and given up themselves to idleness contemplation and solitary devotion the life of such persons may be harmless but it is useless it may be freer from vice than the lives of others but it is less virtuous they have not been exposed to the same temptations with others their innocence has in many cases arisen only from their want of opportunity for committing sin not from strength of mind or the vigor of virtuous principles were a life of monkish indolence necessary or conducive to the improvement and salvation of our souls god would not have placed us in a world where we have so many wants that cannot be satisfied without diligent application to a variety of occupations an active and busy life is perfectly consistent with all that god requires of us for pleasing him or for obtaining eternal happiness holiness preserved uncorrupted and exercised vigorously in active life is much worthier than the inoffensive blamelessness of the mere recluse you should yield your active service unto god you cannot please him more effectually than by following your several vocations by engaging in the ordinary employments of life by pursuing them with industry and being conversant about them in a right manner you do not serve god you do not labor for eternity you do not take care of your souls only when you are meditating or reading or hearing or praying or partaking of the lords supper but also as effectually though these purposes be not perhaps so directly in your thoughts when you are going about your worldly business in a virtuous manner when you are honestly and conscientiously doing the work of your stations you may live to god and yet live in the world to renounce the world and fly to solitude is to renounce the station which god has allotted us and abandon the opportunities of doing good and becoming good which he has given us  men may entertain the mistake of which we are speaking without running into either of the extremes now mentioned they may regard religion as something wholly abstracted from life and yet may engage in the ordinary business of life without neglecting religion altogether in this case they will take up with a false species of religion they will be concerned perhaps anxiously concerned for their salvation but they will pursue it in an improper manner they imagine that the state of their souls depends only on some formal transactions with god on some solitary and secret exertions of the will and the affections in dedicating themselves to him and accepting of jesus christ and that it is no wise affected by the manner in which they carry on their ordinary business they think that they may be religious though they be immoral that they may provide for eternity though they neglect the duties of time that they may be in a state of grace though they be bad husbands bad wives unnatural parents undutiful children unfaithful servants unkind and quarrelsome neighbors or dishonest dealers they regard the graces of the spirit as totally distinct from the moral virtues the conduct which god approves as perfectly different from that behavior which is useful to mankind they make an unnatural divorce between religion and morality in the place of true holiness they substitute an absurd and unprofitable superstition alas my brethren they deceive themselves if they act according to this idea their religion will have no greater influence upon their conduct than if they made no pretenses to religion and therefore it will have no more influence upon their eternal salvation genuine religion is wholly practical grace is but the principle of virtue and good works your religion can be of no value i should rather say you have no real religion if it do not enter into life with you if it do not pervade and animate all your actions  a very great part of that conduct by which your eternal happiness may be promoted consists in transacting your ordinary business in a proper and virtuous manner there is scarcely an action of your lives so insignificant as not either to promote or to obstruct your salvation the most trivial and common actions may be performed right or they may be performed wrong we should all therefore maintain an uninterrupted care to perform all the actions of our lives aright if we maintain this care we shall forward our everlasting happiness by the very same actions by which we obtain or enjoy present things many of the common actions of life are far from being trivial or unimportant in a religious and moral view it is by living in society and employing ourselves in the ordinary business of it that we can find opportunity for many of our most important duties for many of the principal functions of the spiritual and christian life and by seizing these opportunities and using them properly we shall most effectually provide for eternity it is from the ordinary occurrences of life that we find occasion for the principal exertions of those virtues which regard either ourselves our neighbor or our god and these virtues comprehend the whole of our duty and constitute that holiness which is the necessary preparation for heaven  the observations which have been hitherto made abundantly show the importance of that view of religion which i am endeavoring to give you they likewise explain it in some measure for the more particular explication of it which was the second thing proposed let us briefly point out how the three great branches of our duty now mentioned interweave themselves with the ordinary actions and employments of life    there are many duties which we owe properly to ourselves for practicing which we find the opportunity in the course of ordinary life  as long as we dwell in these earthly tabernacles some foresight and diligence about the necessaries and conveniences of the present life is unavoidable god does not forbid it he has not made it inconsistent with the pursuit of future happiness none would wish to starve or to be naked god does not require you to court these hardships you may be diligent you ought to be diligent in your callings god not only allows but commands you to be diligent not slothful in business romans xii     is a precept of divine authority there are many similar precepts god promises his blessing to diligence and gives frequent encouragement to it that man sins and obstructs his own progress to heaven who is idle in his station religion renders industry a duty toward ourselves enforced by the authority of god by reflecting on this obligation to it and allowing it to have some influence upon us we shall convert every exertion of industry in our trade or profession into an act of obedience to god and if while we are prompted to industry by the instincts and prospects of the animal life common to all men we be also impelled to it by a regard to the commandment of god this additional motive cannot fail to quicken our industry to increase it and to render it more successful  god requires that the immediate objects of your industry should not engross your whole hearts that you should not imagine the attainment of them sufficient to make you happy that amidst your labor for them you should maintain a sense that there are things of infinitely greater consequence to be either obtained or lost religion requires you to carry these sentiments through life with you they will not enfeeble your industry they will only restrain it from forced and unnatural exertions they will be no hindrance to its regular and healthful motions they will only prevent its running into distorted and convulsive agitations they will not destroy that eagerness which gives spirit and perserverance to your endeavors they will only extinguish that anxiety solicitude and carefulness which while they make you neglect eternal things often render you at the same time incapable of pursuing present things in the most effectual manner and create immediate vexation of spirit for which no success can make amends in a word such sentiments carried through life and acted upon will only sanctify your industry and render it conducive to your future happiness while it continues as subservient as ever or even becomes more subservient to your present interest  we are so formed as to be capable of enjoyment in those earthly things which we possess god does not contradict our constitution by his laws he does not require us to become insensible even to the lowest pleasures all men eat and drink they are among the most common actions of your lives yet religion is concerned in them if in eating and drinking you are luxurious intemperate or debauched you swallow down poison to your immortal souls but if you eat and drink temperately and in moderation without overvaluing or repining for the pleasures which you have not or abusing those which you have avoiding sensuality and excess if you eat and drink in that degree which promotes the health and strength of the body which renders it fitter for the service of the soul which is decent and becomes a reasonable creature made for much higher enjoyments then you serve god every time you eat and drink you nourish your souls unto eternal life by the very same actions by which you daily nourish your bodies  it is a duty which we owe to ourselves to preserve sobriety of mind composure of spirit a freedom from all violent passions humility and selfgovernment it is in the ordinary employments of life that we find both temptations to violate this temper and occasions for exercising it it is only by maintaining it amidst all the occurrences of common life and all the calls and vicissitudes and tumults of business that we can obey those divine precepts which enjoin it you are engaged in the pursuit of some considerable advantage you have now an opportunity of curbing the violence of your desires of keeping them from possessing your whole sold this is incumbent on you and by this you shall prepare yourselves for that happy state which excludes every ungoverned passion in the course of your occupations you meet with unexpected incidents sudden turns perplexities and intricacies you are called to avoid being discomposed by them this will be a preparation for the superior regions of perfect serenity and peace at the same time that it prevents present uneasiness and even fits you for the most proper management of your worldly business  in this world objects frequently occur which tend to draw us off from the path of life they meet us in the scenes of business and in the hours of relaxation and amusement in company in solitude in every situation continual circumspection and watchfulness against their drawing us into the ways of death by seducing us into sin is a duty which we owe to our own souls and it is a duty which we must put in practice every day and every hour in every place and in every condition we must carry this temper through life with us we must preserve and exercise it in all the various circumstances in which at any time we stand else we cannot persist steadfastly in the narrow way that leads to heaven    in like manner in the ordinary business of our lives we shall find the most frequent and the best opportunities of performing our several duties to our fellowmen religion requires us to embrace these opportunities and by embracing them and performing the duties suitable to them we shall serve god and please him and contribute to the salvation of our own souls  you spend the day in merchandise in labor in the business of your calling whatever it is you must carry your religion along with you you must exercise it all the time you are thus employed you may do your work either honestly and uprightly or the contrary if you deceive those with whom you have dealings or defraud them or injure them you injure your own souls much more you move a step forward to destruction but if in every part of your business without exception you act justly and equitably and deal with integrity and faithfulness you walk before the lord while you seem to be only busy in your worldly calling you advance in your journey toward heaven while you seem to be only going round in the circle of employments which belong to this mortal state the shop the exchange the occupations of active life form the only theater on which the virtues of justice fidelity and honesty can be practiced and without constantly practicing these you can have no religion these virtues tend to secure the confidence of men and to promote your worldly prosperity and by the uniform practice of them you likewise lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust does corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal mat vi      in the train of life in the intercourse of society and business some person does you undesigned harm or an intended injury this is the time when you have it in your power to exercise and by exercising to improve patience meekness forbearance forgiveness kindness it is only by exercising them in such circumstances by making them to run through all the actions to which such circumstances give occasion that you can show yourselves to be the children of the highest luke vi     and heirs of the kingdom of life if on the occasions mentioned you on the contrary indulge bitterness anger wrath malice revenge if you give way to the expressions of these dispositions in the communications of company or the connexions of business you show yourselves alienated from the gentle spirit of true religion and you render yourselves fit for the society of those fallen angels in whom malevolent passions reign  you go into company you enter into conversation the characters and the conduct of others become the topics this is the situation in which you are called to make candid and favorable constructions to vindicate aspersed innocence to clear up misconstructed virtues to agologize for exaggerated failings to speak the truth in love ephesians iv     you have opportunity for these duties every day it is in the relaxations of society in the turns of common conversation that you find the opportunity and they are essential and important duties of religion if instead of performing them you in your gayest meetings and most unreserved talk defame slander revile or backbite you need make no pretensions to true religion in your closets or at church if any man among you says the apostle james seem to be religious and bridleth not his tongue but deceives his own heart this mans religion is vain jam i     he that bridleth not his tongue from offenses so heinous as these does the office of satan and by the employment of those which he reckons his disengaged hours and for which he thinks that little account will be required of him entitleth himself to a portion with satan  in the course of your employments by the events which cast up in the train of your ordinary business you have opportunities of returning good to your benefactors of doing services to those who have done you evil of supplying the wants of the poor by employing them or by other means which are in your way of supporting the friendless of producing concealed merit or of doing some other good office to those with whom you meet different employments afford different means of doing the same good offices to others or opportunities of doing different good offices but every employment affords some means and some opportunities it is a great part of the duty which god requires of you to embrace and improve these opportunities this is to do good to be rich in good works ready to distribute willing to communicate by this you lay up in store for yourselves a good foundation against the time to come that you may lay hold on eternal life   timothy vi         i cannot mention particularly all the ways in which true holiness will enter into social life and exert itself toward others in all the varied scenes and complicated situations which turn up in the course of ordinary business in addition to the instances already given i shall only observe in general that every act of proper behavior which we show as parents as children as masters as servants as we belong to a particular occupation or profession as we are placed in a particular relation is a real act of holiness pleasing to god and conducive to our eternal happiness on the other hand every instance of improper behavior in any of these relations or situations displeases god and retards our progress to heaven when we contemplate religion as thus concerned in our whole behavior toward others as either observed or violated in all our social actions how extensive does it appear to be how uninterrupted are our opportunities for it how constant should be our attention to it how often do we neglect or transgress its obligations when we imagine our actions perfectly indifferent and removed wholly out of the province of religion    we must likewise carry piety along with us through the whole course of our lives we must exercise godliness in all our occupations else we have no true religion nor can be fit for the enjoyment of god this is an important part of our subject the illustration of which we cannot now enter upon  sermon ii religion intimately connected with ordinary life psalm cxvi   i will walk before the lord in the land of the living religion considered in its just extent contains two sorts of duties the duties of piety and those which regard the actions of the natural and social life both are essential to it but men show a strong propensity to consider the former as unconnected with life and the latter as unconnected with religion and by a misconception of both sorts equally though in different respects to disunite religion from the occupations of common life it proceeds from a partial view of both these and it tends to render our practice of both defective  men confine their idea of piety to the acts of immediate worship they consider it not as what should as what can enter into common life they think that they serve god only when they are worshipping him and disengaged from their worldly employments conceiving religion in so false and contracted a light they necessarily regard the actions of the natural and social life as without the verge of religion as not requiring or admitting any regulation or direction from its influence  in consequence of these partial and imperfect conceptions some have withdrawn from the business of life that they might give up themselves wholly to devotion or have become negligent in their lawful calling as interrupting their application to religion and many more intent on their worldly employments and interests and regarding all acts of devotion as encroaching upon these neglect them totally or crowd them into as little time as possible god is not in all their thoughts psalm x     persons of a serious turn and sensible of the importance of piety will apply to what they consider as belonging to it but if they imagine acts of immediate worship to be all that belongs to it their application will be of little value they will be punctual in performing these but they will think that when they have performed these they have done all that piety requires and are abundantly religious and too often they imagine that if they spend some hours of the day in devotion they may do through the rest of it whatever they please whatever their vicious passions prompt them to at least they are not sufficiently careful to avoid doing so thus their religion becomes a mere round of external services attended perhaps with transient and unmeaning emotions of soul but not a preparation for the right conduct of life and they bear in themselves that character of corruption which the apostle assigns to the men of the last days having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof   timothy iii     whether men have a regard to religion or have not if the actions of the natural and social life be considered as without the province of religion the necessary consequence will be that men shall think themselves at liberty to perform them not according to the rules of religion whenever we look upon the ordinary actions of common life as indifferent whenever we forget that there is either virtue or vice in almost every one of them we are in great danger of indulging vice and contracting guilt in the performance of them whenever we allow ourselves to imagine that these actions have no influence on our salvation we shall be ready to do them in such a manner as must obstruct our salvation  of the three classes of duties which are incumbent upon us those which regard ourselves and those which regard other men are too often considered as little connected with religion and are for that reason reckoned such as may be in some measure neglected without great danger to our salvation i have therefore shown that our habitual behavior both toward ourselves and toward others in the various situations of common life necessarily implies good or evil and promotes or obstructs our everlasting happiness the other class of duties those which regard god and are comprehended under the name of piety are on the contrary often considered as unconnected with the ordinary business of life in opposition to this mistake i now proceed to show that we must carry piety along with us through the whole course of our lives that we must exercise godliness in all our occupations else we can have no true religion nor be fit for the enjoyment of god in heaven  we may acquire some lively impressions of god in retirement or in the ordinances of worship but if these impressions do not remain with us and actuate us when we enter into the world and all the time we are conversant in the world they are of no moment religious affections may be nourished in the retreats of devotion as a child is fed within doors but it is in the open air and by the bustle of exercise that the child acquires and shows health vigor and agility and it is in the field of the world and by being introduced into its several occupations that the religious affections obtain and display strength firmness and energy it is in the world they are put to the trial it is there we find opportunities for exerting them and it is by being exerted there that they are improved into a commanding temper of piety  there is no situation in life which gives not scope for some exercise of godliness and which requires it not if we would not be wanting to our duty piety or a regard to god is a vital spirit which may run through and ought to run through all the virtues which respect either ourselves or others to animate to model and direct them it is not excluded from any place or condition which admits any virtue whatever it cannot be dispensed with from any such place or condition but that virtue loses much of its luster and is even in danger of perishing  love to god is an affection which does not spend itself in silent admiration or warm feelings it is fit to enter into life and to act in life we are commanded to keep ourselves in the love of god jude ver     it is a temper which may possess us as constantly and influence us as regularly as affection to a parent or a friend it should influence us through life in the whole of our behavior in a manner similar to that in which affection to a parent or a friend operates on such parts of our behavior as have a respect to them love to god does not display itself so much or ascertain its sincerity and ardour so unexceptionably by any emotions inwardly felt or by any raptures of devotion as by its effects upon our actions by making us delight to obey and please god in every part of our behavior by making us willing to relinquish what we most fondly desire or to incur what we most vehemently dread rather than offend him in committing any sin or neglecting any duty by alluring us to the imitation of all those moral attributes which render god the object of our love and by cherishing benevolence and drawing out beneficence to all men who are the children of our father in heaven love to god will find opportunities for some of these exercises of it in all our worldly business in all the actions and events of common life and if any man neglect these exercises of it whenever he finds opportunity for them how dwells the love of god in him   john iii     his heart is void of it though liveliness of imagination or a constitutional warmth of affection may lead him to presume that his love to god is ardent  reverence of god is not more analogous to the love of god in itself than in its effects upon our ordinary conduct it is not exercised only when we set ourselves to contemplate and celebrate his greatness we may be and we ought to be in the fear of the lord all the day long prove xxiii     if we have any reverence of god it will show itself every hour in our most common behavior in the shade of solitude amidst the temptations of society the cares of business and the relaxation of amusements in every situation it will make us to stand in awe and not sin psalm iv    it will prompt us to act in a manner worthy of the presence the majesty and the perfections of god  gratitude is due to god for the blessings which we receive from him the events of ordinary life furnish us with constant subjects of gratitude you eat your daily food you find yourselves in health you receive the price of your labor you obtain something which you desired you prosper in your way your duty in all these situations the apostle paul points out in every thing give thanks be grateful for this is the will of god in christ jesus concerning you   thessalonians v     the exercise of gratitude is not confined to professed acknowledgments of the mercies which we have received in praise and thanksgiving in private or public devotion the world also is a field for the exercise of gratitude it is exercised whenever it implants in the heart a new motive to abstinence from sin and hatred of it whenever it warms the soul with additional alacrity in doing good and makes us take greater pleasure in it these exercises of gratitude should be diffused through life as much as the blessings are which demand our gratitude they should influence us as often as we are engaged in any action which can imply either good or evil and what one action of our lives does not imply them  common life is the acknowledged sphere of resignation to the will of god piety exerting itself in resignation is the proper root and the only firm support of many of those duties to ourselves the operation of which through the occurrences of common life either has been already delineated or may easily be traced composure for instance amidst the tumults and fluctuations of the world tranquillity in the uncertainty of its prospects contentment and selfenjoyment under its disappointments fortitude in the view of its dangers if these virtues are nipt off from piety they become puny and wither and die they must be practiced through life but they cannot be practiced except the exertions of a pious temper be twisted as it were with all the acts of them to give them strength all the events of life are uncertain we are often in adversity our favorite designs are disappointed our dearest comforts are taken from us we become interested about trifles and they fail us we cannot perform the duties which we owe to ourselves in these seasons without deriving aid from piety these are the seasons which demand the practice of resignation submission and trust in god these are the seasons in which we must put forth all our strength to retain and exercise these pious principles else we shall fall into the sins of peevishness discontent repining murmuring anxiety and solicitude  piety requires subjection to the authority of god as well as submission to his providence a sense of his authority will produce a constant disposition to obey his laws but his laws are nothing else but rules for the particulars of our behavior in all the various circumstances of human life there is not a situation in which we can be placed that is without the verge of their direction there is not a situation in which our conduct will not be affected by our having a regard to gods supreme authority or by our failing in that regard  god is not an unconcerned spectator of the behavior of reasonable beings he tries their hearts he weighs all their actions he approves or he disapproveth them a sense of this a prevailing respect to his judgment a contempt of the opinions of all the world when opposed to it is an important part of piety and a part of it for exercising which the state of this world gives continual opportunity in this world we see vice practiced and hear it justified we find virtue neglected and even turned into ridicule the immediate pleasures and advantages of sin disguise its horrors the the present uneasinesses and inconveniences to which virtue sometimes exposes men eclipse its beauty corrupt fashion seems to alter the measures of right and wrong behavior the promiscuous distribution of outward things renders us inattentive to the opposite natures and the opposite consequences of righteousness and iniquity such situations frequently occur in the train of ordinary life and they give opportunity for exerting a supreme regard to the unerring judgment of god who can see through every disguise who cannot be imposed upon by the most plausible pretenses whose judgment is always according to truth romans ii    this regard is exerted when in the whole tenor of our lives we maintain an abhorrence of all evil and the love of all goodness and persist invariably in avoiding the one and pursuing the other uninfluenced by the false opinions of men or the irregular appearances of the world and valuing only the approbation of god  piety leads us to the imitation of god but all that is enjoined us under the idea of imitating god consists in the right performance of the several actions of common life particularly of the social life it consists in our loving our enemies doing good to them that hate us blessing them that curse us praying for them which despitefully use us and persecute us giving to every man that osketh of us and lending causing no man to despair mat v        luke vi          it consists in putting away all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evilspeaking with all malice and being kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another and walking in love ephesians iv       v      it consists in purifying ourselves   john iii    and being holy in all manner of conversation pet i     it is only in the course of our ordinary conduct and amidst the temptations which occur in society that we can have scope for these exertions of a godlike disposition  in a word all the affections which belong to a temper of piety unite their force to restrain us from doing evil and to excite us to do good in all the varied situations of common life every pious affection shows itself by suitable expressions in the offices of devotion but no pious affection is completed by these immediate expressions of it there are likewise active exertions of piety which run through the whole of our ordinary behavior every regard to god in a manner peculiar to itself inclines or urges us to all the duties of life that is to the right performance of all even our most common actions  devout persons have often recommended it as highly beneficial to mix acts of immediate worship silent ejaculations of adoration thanksgiving prayer consession or repentance with our ordinary employments and have justly remarked that unobserved by mn and without any interruption of these employments we may find time and opportunity for them in the busiest scenes of life and even in the midst of our innocent amusements this is a proper and very advantageous practice and yet show i unto you a more excellent way   cor xii     piety may be and ought to be still more intimately mixed and incorporated with our ordinary employments they ought all to be constantly carried on under the restraints which religion imposes and by the principles which it inspires to carry them on in this manner will be to come up to the full import of the descriptions of a life of virtue uniformly pursued under religious impressions which the scripture gives when it speaks of good men as setting the lord always before them psalm xvi    acknowledging him in all their ways prove iii    walking before the lord or walking with god  the gospel having brought us acquainted with the son of god requires faith in him faith in christ may be considered either as a firm belief of what he has taught us or as a dependence on his atonement and mediation for our acceptance with god notwithstanding the demerit of our sins and the imperfection of our holiness considered in both lights faith is a principle fit to run through our whole lives and to mix with all the most ordinary actions of them  all the truths which christ has taught us in the gospel are motives to the practice of holiness they are constantly proposed in scripture as incitements both to holiness in general and to the several particular virtues the faith which the gospel requires is not a more assent to these truths it implies such a lively impression and such a permanent sense of them as may form our whole temper to holiness and influence all our actions a temper of holiness consists in the strength of good affections and in purity from vicious passions good affections are excited when their objects are brought into our view and placed in a striking light they are strengthened when their objects are brought often into view and attentively considered the truths of religion set these objects of good affections in the most striking lights and a firm belief of the truths of religion keeps these objects constantly in our view and fixes our attention upon them and thus renders the good affections habitually prevalent in our hearts it is this same belief likewise that presents to our minds all those considerations which tend to counteract vicious passions and to purify us gradually from them every action proceeds from some motive without which neither would the action be done nor that affection which is its immediate principle be supported every good action proceeds from some religious motive from some truth urging us to the practice of it it is faith that suggests this motive and it must suggest it in the moment in which the action is to be done true faith keeps all the principles of religion which can in any way influence our conduct which can either restrain us from doing evil or prompt us to do good in a continual readiness to occur to us whenever we have occasion for them we have occasion for them in every situation in which we have occasion to act faith therefore must attend us and suggest the principles of religion as motives to action in every place and in every one of our various occupations it must run through our whole conduct bestowing vigor and stability on all our virtues purifying our hearts act xv    working by love gal v    producing good works tit iii   jam ii        it alone can furnish the weapons with which we may combat all the alluring prospects which sin sets before us and all the difficulties and dangers to which virtue may expose us and of these weapons we have need every moment this says john is the victory that overcomes the world even our faith   john v      to overcome the world our faith must operate as often as we are conversant with the world it is when faith thus exerts itself in restraining us from sin in cherishing good affections in exciting us to the several duties of life that we may be said to walk by faith   cor v    the apostle paul exhibits his own faith in this very attitude when he says the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god gal ii  0   faith considered as a dependence upon christ seems not to mingle so congenially with the ordinary actions of life yet it is truly fit to mingle with them in a very great degree whenever we reflect that we have committed any sin and feel remorse for it and in the present frail state of man how often must this happen to every sensible heart it is faith exerting itself in dependence upon christ that mitigates our sorrow and restores our cheerfulness whenever we are conscious of a good action when the consciousness of it gives us good hope  thessalonians ii     it is by trust in jesus christ that this hope is supported and preserved from sinking beneath the sense of our imperfection and guilt it is dependence upon christ that encourages us to amend what we know to be wrong in ourselves and in our former conduct for it is dependence upon him that makes us to feel that it shall not be in vain and while we are imperfect creatures a great part of right conduct must consist in endeavors to do the several actions of life better than we have done them in former instances in general hopes and fears of futurity not only arise in the hours of reflection but often influence us in the actions of life and in a christian hope and fear can never be wholly separated from exercises of faith toward jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come   thessalonians i  0  and through whom eternal life is the gift of god to us romans     the gospel reveals to us the holy spirit also and requires us to exercise dependence on the assistance which he is sent on purpose to impart to be convinced that this dependence should run through our whole lives and mingle with all our actions and to understand how it may do so we need only recollect the end for which the assistance of the spirit is given it is given for our sanctification it is given to be a principle of purity and virtue and activity in welldoing through the whole course of our life and in all its occupations we have opportunities of avoiding evil and of doing good and whenever we exert ourselves in either it should be with dependence on the aids of the divine spirit we should have an habitual trust in these similar to that habitual sense which good men entertain of the dependence of their nature and all their powers upon god if we have such trust it will lead us not only to recognize at stated times the holy spirit as the author of our virtues and to pray to god for his aids but also to look up to him in the very moment of action and by the consciousness of the presence and support of so powerful an assistant to invigorate ourselves in every hour of languor and to encourage ourselves in every moment of temptation and difficulty that we may without weariness or intermission put forth all the strength which he imparts to us in resisting all the attacks of sin and practicing every virtue as we find the opportunity it is this habitual and active improvement of the divine aids that the apostle recommends to the galatians this i say then walk in the spirit gal v     the expression implies that we should have the whole tenor of our ordinary behavior regulated by the influence of the spirit of god  thus i have endeavored to represent religion to you in its connection with ordinary life i have shown the importance of this view of it and i have explained it by pointing out the opportunities which ordinary life affords for the practice of religion and by tracing the influence of religion on our behavior in these several opportunities religion consists not in our withdrawing from the occupations of the present world but in our being conversant in them after a virtuous manner the apostle paul in describing that goodness which the gospel was revealed on purpose to enforce reduces it to the three heads of virtue which we have now illustrated that we live soberly righteously and godly and he adds in this present world tit ii     the addition is not vain it suggests the very idea which i have made it my business to unfold it intimates that we have no religion no christianity if we do not carry it into the world with us and exercise it in all the circumstances of life the apostle james gives us the same view of religion though in a different manner of expression pure religion and undefiled before god even the father is this to visit the fatherless and the widow in their affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world jam i     the world contains temptations to vice and it presents opportunities of doing good in all the ways of virtuous exertion both occur at all times and in all conditions and pure religion consists in guarding against the former and embracing and improving the latter whenever they occur when our savior was most solicitous for the happiness of his disciples when he had the most immediate view of the dangers to which they were exposed in a world that hated them as it had before hated him john xvii     when he declared that they were not of the world ver     even then he said to his father i pray not that thou should take them out of the world but that thou should keep them from the evil ver     it was by being sent forth into the world and acting in it that they could be useful and that they could become happy  the example of our savior as well as the intimations of scripture sets religion in this point of view through all the early part of his life he labored in josephs vocation as a carpenter he left it not till the season came when he was called to enter on another vocation inconsistent with it and which required all his time even after that he still lived in the world mixed in society conversed with men was in all points tempted like as we are gal ii  0  and in this situation continued to be without sin heb iv     exhibited an example of every virtue in perfection and by that example showed mankind in what manner religion should exert itself in the several occurrences of common life it is for the same purpose that the lives and actions of good men are recorded in scripture it is to let us see how they exercised their religion in the scenes of action and in secular employment and the wisdom of god by delivering a great part of the scripture in the form of history has provided for recording so great a number and variety of examples that in them we may observe the operation of religion in almost every possible condition and juncture of human life if you be not religious and virtuous in active life in whatever station you fill in whatever occupation you follow it is your own fault not the fault of your situation religion and virtue may be incorporated with the business of every lawful calling these have actually been incorporated together in the practice of many of your fellowmen the spirit of true religion and the spirit of worldly business are not repugnant like a drop of water and a drop of oil which repel each other and refuse to mingle they may be rendered like two drops of mercury which run together and form one drop the improvement and happiness of our souls is most effectually promoted when all our worldly occupations are rendered subservient to it our present interests will likewise be best secured when all our endeavors after them are regulated by religion and virtue  when the boundaries between religion and ordinary life are misplaced both must be unduly contracted they are not like two territories separated by a precise limit but like territories which besides the parts that lie in this manner distinct have many fields in common or connected by mutual servitudes so that they can be cultivated and improved only by united efforts it is sometimes said that god has reserved the lords day for himself and his service and that he has given us the other six days of the week for ourselves this manner of speaking is inaccurate and has too much a tendency to disguise the connection between religion and common life the lords day god has in some sense reserved peculiarly to himself on it we ought to abstain from our worldly occupations but its exercises are not unrelated to these occupations they are designed to prepare us for the right and virtuous management of them and should be performed with this view the other six days god has allowed us for our worldly occupations but not exclusively of serving him for in these very occupations we ought to serve god every hour of all the six days we do serve him in them whenever we carry them on in a virtuous manner by thus carrying them on we promote our salvation though we should not at all times explicitly intend to promote it by them but it will render our worldly occupations the more subservient to our salvation for it will contribute to our practicing them aright that throughout the whole course of them we preserve a solicitude for our salvation and frequently exert actual desires of promoting it by means of the labors of our station thus shall we be possessed of an habitual good intention thus shall we apply a good intention to our most indifferent actions and direct them all to laudable and worthy ends  some have apologized for the multiplication of ceremonies in religion by asserting that this multiplies the opportunities of serving god and the means of promoting our salvation the apology is frivolous the observance of ceremonies is neither serving god nor a means of our salvation except the ceremonies be of divine appointment and if they were yet still the multiplication of ceremonies would multiply our dangers of neglecting his will and falling into sin would increase the difficulty of religion would render many things necessary which might have been safely omitted if god had not required them by positive precepts and would thus prove a snare to our souls but the ordinary actions of life must necessarily be done and by setting ourselves to do them all with a regard to god and with a view to the improvement and salvation of our souls we shall without incurring any new danger or inconvenience multiply the means of our salvation increase the number of our virtues and avoid many vices we shall render our whole existence one continued act of goodness religion and obedience and we shall be in all the situations and occurrences of life pleasing to him whom we are made to please and in pleasing whom our happiness consists  to conclude we are at present in a state of discipline for eternity every event every circumstance of this state gives us opportunity for the practice of some virtue and it is by acting virtuously in every circumstance of this state that we can be improved in holiness and become fit for heaven our commonest actions are those in which we think religion least concerned and on which we are apt to bestow the least attention but of our commonest actions we ought rather to take the greatest care for they are most frequently repeated they will therefore form the strongest habits they will most promote our improvement and our happiness if they be constantly performed right but they will most obstruct it if we indulge ourselves in a custom of performing them wrong  sermon iii justice the decorum of the character of judges preached at the assizes deuteronomy xvi  0 that which is altogether just shall thou follow the duties which are incumbent upon us may be very properly divided into two classes such as are incumbent upon all men and such as are incumbent upon particular ranks of men  in some instances the duties of the latter kind are totally distinct from those of the former kind peculiar circumstances in the situation of certain classes of men give them opportunities for the exercise of particular virtues and the practice of particular duties for which there is no scope in other situations thus the duties of submission are incumbent only upon subjects not at all upon the supreme magistrates and on the other hand all the virtues which regard the exercise of civil authority are peculiar to the rulers of nations private persons have no opportunity of practicing them  but in most cases the duties of the man and the duties of the man of a certain character are in some measure coincident our duties are always correspondent to our situations but the situations of all men agree in many of the most important particulars and therefore give all men opportunities for the practice of many of the most important duties all the great instances of piety charity justice and temperance are indispensibly incumbent on every one that is born of a woman on the magistrate and the subject on the minister and the people on the high and the low on the rich and the poor on the old and the young but still the situation of every class contains some peculiar circumstances which render several duties of universal obligation peculiarly incumbent on persons of that class either laying them under special obligations to them or requiring particular exercises of them such duties may justly be considered as peculiar duties of that station which in this manner demands them it were easy to multiply examples the text affords one all men should be just the obligation of justice is absolutely indispensible the violation of it exposes a man to detestation and insamy yet even this virtue whose obligation is to all men so sacred and inviolable is declared to be peculiarly the duty of rulers god had said to moses judges and officers shall thou make thee in all thy gates which the lord thy god gives thee throughout thy tribes he had declared what should be their business they shall judge the people with just judgment then addressing each of them as if they had been already appointed to the office he cautions them against the common perversion of justice thou shall not wrest judgment thou shall not respect persons neither take a gift and to intimate the great importance of justice in their public character he repeats the charge to practice it in the text that which is altogether just shall thou follow in the original the manner of expression is emphatical thou shall practice strict justice thou shall practice justice diligently thou shall practice justice constantly the scripture contains many similar injunctions  the general duties of men are for obvious reasons the most frequent subjects of discourses from the pulpit but the practice of those duties which are peculiarly incumbent on particular classes of men is often of as great importance to their own character and to the interests of society and as necessary for their obtaining the approbation of god as the practice of their general duties and failures in what belongs to our distinguishing rank and profession are as great blemishes are attended with as pernicious consequences and will be as severely punished by god as any other vices they likewise are on this account very proper subjects of discourse especially when suitable occasions invite us to the consideration of them in this latter case the address is more confined than in the former but the very same principles which render it at all times fit to inculcate the general doctrines and duties of christianity even on those whose abilities and advantages enable them to acquire the knowledge of them for themselves render it likewise not improper for us at some times to remind part of the audience of what they already know to be specially incumbent upon them the present occasion then will give a propriety to our endeavoring to show that strict and inflexible justice is peculiarly the virtue of all judges magistrates and rulers and to point out the reasons why this virtue constitutes the immediate decorum of their character  in order to accomplish this design it will be sufficient to observe that justice is immediately connected with the end of their office that they have opportunities for peculiar exertions of justice and that they lie under peculiar obligations to it  first justice is immediately connected with the end of that office which magistrates judges and rulers bear  every station even the lowest requires some peculiar duties from those who occupy it for every station contains some circumstances peculiar to itself and is designed to answer some useful purpose which cannot be answered without observing certain congruous rules the mechanic must perform some things not required from other men in order to render his occupation as useful to society as it ought to be by failing to perform these things he becomes faulty in his own trade to be faulty in ones own trade is in the sense of every man to be doubly faulty but in the meaner professions it does not engage our attention much because their ends are not of distinguished importance  the higher employments as well as the lower are directly calculated for certain ends to promote which certain virtues are peculiarly requisite to fail in the exercise of these virtues defeats the very end of the office and is inconsistent with its functions the higher offices in society are instituted for momentous ends the defeating of these ends produces great and extensive mischiefs and therefore the vices which defeat them are in men who hold these offices regarded with singular abhorrence the dignity of the office and the importance of its end mix with our sentiments excite a sense of absolute impropriety and indecency in the vices directly subversive of it and make us consider the opposite virtues in a peculiar point of view with a particular modification of our approbation as constituting the decorum of character in men of that profession every profession of public importance in society has a correspondent decorum of character belonging to it and this decorum always consists in the possession of those virtues which are most essentially necessary for the right exercise of that profession by other virtues men adorn their calling but the virtues which form its proper decorum they must cultivate in order to avoid disgracing it  of all the virtues justice is the most intimately necessary for performing the functions and answering the end of the judges office  all virtue properly belongs to him it becomes the man who is exalted above others by his rank authority or power to be more excellent than his neighbor prove xii     and universal virtue is the true excellence of man every vice is base and introduces some degree of meanness into the character but every sort of meanness is unsuitable to those persons whose rank inspires respect whose authority is the object of veneration and cannot be supported without properly affecting the opinions and sentiments of those who are subject to it  many particular virtues are in different respects peculiarly necessary to the support of the authority of rulers and to the right performance of the duties of their station and the opposite vices obstruct this end and are for that reason unseemly in the ruler  temperance selfgovernment sedate recollection of soul correctness and dignity of conduct become rulers levity dissipation gaity or giddiness of demeanor love of pleasure and every sensual excess misbecome them those virtues are suitable and these vices perfectly unsuitable to the elevation of their rank to the gravity of their character to the solemnity of their office to the intention and application of mind which it requires the littleness of these vices joined with the idea of men who represent the public and ought to sustain its honor forms an incongruous mixture which is necessarily ungraceful and cannot fail to give disgust to the spectator  in like manner piety is a becoming ingredient in the character and an indispensible duty of the station of those to whom any part of the government is committed and every kind and degree of impiety is unfit and unbecoming in them they are the guardians of the peace and order of society and consequently ought to be the guardians and and friends of religion without which that peace and order cannot be preserved their rank will give force to an example of piety exhibited by them and by rendering the practice of it more general among their inferiors they will multiply those blessings which religion confers upon society religion will be the most powerful principle of that impartial and steady justice which society has a right to expect from its judges an inward temper of fervent piety will set god continually before them in the very light in which the psalmist represents him standing in the congregation of the mighty judging among the gods saying to them judge not unjustly accept not the persons of the wicked defend the poor and fatherless do justice to the afflicted and needy deliver the poor and needy rid them out of the hand of the wicked psalm lxxxii           thus again avarice is very incongruous to the character of a judge its meanness debases and degrades him but its incongruity arises principally from its being very strongly repugnant to the end of his office and very directly inconsistent with that justice which is his immediate duty its demands allowed to mingle with the functions of his office could not fail to sophisticate them all for a gift blinds the wise and perverteth the words of the righteous exodus xxiii          a freedom from the sordid degrees of avarice is necessary to preserve a judge from being always suspected of corruption from actually becoming corrupt whenever a bribe is in his power and from appearing infamous on that account a soul having covetousness chap xviii     full of generosity superior to all the allurements of riches is necessary for giving his character the proper elevation for securing him against all danger of corruption and for establishing a general confidence in his integrity  but still even these virtues are more indirectly subservient to the end of the judges office than justice is other virtues promote that end by the intervention of something else to which they contribute justice promotes it immediately without the intervention of any thing else the exercise of justice itself is the proximate means of answering the purposes of government and judgment one of the principal ways in which other virtues promote these purposes is by supporting or contributing to the steady and vigorous exercise of incorruptible justice injustice directly and of itself defeats these purposes and is in every instance absolutely inconsistent with them other vices obstruct them sometimes very strongly but always more remotely and indirectly often by preparing the way to injustice  in a word magistrates and judges are set over men for this very end to do judgment and justiee as their office is of divine appointment they are charged to pursue this end by god himself every deviation from justice is perfectly reversing the end of their appointment justice is therefore their peculiar virtue the immediate decorum of their character  secondly rulers and judges have from their office opportunity for many exertions of justice wholly peculiar to themselves on this account also justice may be considered as in a special manner the virtue of their character and station  every private person has opportunity for many exertions of the virtue of justice all the parts of our intercourse with others give us opportunities for abstaining from hurting them for rendering every man his due in respect of property reputation and honor for performing promises for executing faithfully what has been committed to our trust the uniform practice of these several offices of justice entitles private persons to the character of just and honest men a failure in any one of them would in some measure forfeit that character  rulers have in common with other men opportunities for all these duties for their connexions with mankind by means of outward things are the same with those of other men but the most blameless practice of these duties is not sufficient to constitute a ruler a just and righteous man many other exercises of justice are as indispensibly incumbent upon him as any of these is upon other men to him it belongs to procure justice for those who cannot procure it to themselves to execute justice between man and man and between individuals and society the poor man who cannot himself resist the oppression of the great the peaceable man who is harrassed by the encroachments of the man of violence the orphan whose rights are invaded by him that has no bowels claim the protection of the judge and can obtain redress only by bringing their cause under his cognizance differences arising from the ignorance or the selfpartiality of persons well disposed can be determined only by the superior knowledge and unbiassed justice of the judge when individuals are injured or the public disturbed by crimes it is to the integrity of the judge that they must look up for help it belongs to his office to determine equally in every case to vindicate violated rights to frustrate unrighteous demands to punish destructive crimes how extensive then is the sphere of public justice which is peculiar to the ruler and the judge in every instance of public justice he must make conscience of doing what is right else he forfeits the character of a just and honest man in the very same way as another person would forfeit it by being convicted of a transgression of private justice he must be superior to all influence from the favor or displeasure of men and from every motive of interest in his public character he must refuse to feel what it is amiable to feel and to comply with in private life the suggestions of natural affection the attractions of blood the tenderness of friendship the impulse of gratitude the emotions of compassion he must not allow either admiration of a persons general worth or indignation against his habitual baseness sentiments which in ordinary life it is glorious to cherish to mingle with his decrees the moment he is seated on his tribunal he must know no man after the flesh   cor v     he must obstinately abstain from considering any man in any other light but that precise light in which he appears in the present cause ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment thou shall not respect the person of the foor nor honor the person of the mighty but in righteousness shall thou judge thy neighbor lev xix     may not that be justly considered as a peculiar virtue of the ruler for the exercise of which he has so many peculiar occasions  thirdly justice may be considered as in a peculiar manner belonging to rulers judges and magistrates because they are under peculiar obligations to it  it will be found on examination that our allwise creator has in forming human nature enforced every virtue by sanctions whose strength is precisely in proportion to the degree in which that virtue is necessary to human life and society justice is absolutely necessary to the safety of human life and to the very existence of society the universal violation of it would multiply positive pains and sufferings upon mankind and prevent the possibility of their union accordingly the practice of justice is secured by the most powerful motives it is one of those virtues which conscience makes us feel to be of sacred and inviolable obligation the transgression of it by others excites our abhorrence and detestation the consciousness of a trangression of it by ourselves produces remorse and selfcondemnation in both cases our sentiments are attended with a sense of merited disgrace and punishment  different exercises of the same virtue are in consequence of this constitution of our nature elt to be more or less strictly obligatory in proportion to the degree of their necessity in human life all men are indispensably bound to every act of justice that comes within their sphere but some exercises of justice are more necessary than others and therefore of stricter obligation not to perceive the superiority of their obligation not to condemn transgressions of them more severely not to abhor them more violently not to ascribe to them more atrocious guilt and higher demerit would demonstrate a perversion of our sentiments a depravation of our conscience  the same virtues and the same exercises of them are more essential to the support of society in some characters than in others and it is a consequence of the structure of our nature already pointed out that on the former they are felt by every uncorrupted heart to be proportionably more sacredly obligatory  these principles which have a plain foundation in the constitution of human nature are sufficient for evincing that magistrates and judges are under peculiar obligations to justice all injustice is destructive to society but it is far more destructive when it is practiced by rulers than if it were practiced only by private persons justice in all men is beneficial to society but in judges it is more beneficial  every act of injustice brings positive hurt on the person who is affected by it but an unjust judgment hurts with the cutting aggravations of its being done under form of law and of its impeaching the person whom it injures as if he had been injurious private persons are connected only with a few and therefore only a few can be hurt by their injustice but the injustice of a judge is of more extensive consequence it hurts all who are subject to his jurisdiction private injustice may be checked or redressed by the righteousness of the judge but if the judge be unrighteous by whom shall his injustice be restrained the danger is so great and so obvious that in every state superior tribunals are appointed for correcting and curbing the injustice of the inferior but if the supreme tribunal be corrupted the evil is without a remedy then the oppressed complain in vain they sigh in secret and are afraid to seek redress then the injured man who had the boldness to seek redress for his violated rights has the mortification to find the violation ratified and doubled by his efforts to avoid it then he who endeavored to defend himself from a slight wrong sees his endeavors plunge him into ruin then the wicked lifts up his horn on high psalm lxxv      he ravages at his will the land and all its inhabitants thereof are dissolved verse    the foundations of the earth are out of course psalm lxxxii    even to seek redress against the iniquity of a subordinate judge is often grievous the weak may be crushed the poor may be beggared by the injustice of the meanest magistrate they are unable to prosecute their cause though it be unquestionably good they must sit down ruined that they may avoid deeper ruin the very suspicion of injustice in judges is of pernicious consequence it deprives men of that sense of security which is necessary to the comfort of life and is one of happiest effects of a free constitution of government it fills them with habitual apprehension that their most perfect rights may be invaded it makes them dread to vindicate them when they are invaded it dejects and torments their souls with all those terrors which are incident to the subjects of despotism it impresses them with the gloomy idea that all things are precarious say every feeling heart are not the uncertainties the anxieties the perplexities of this situation real and grievous sufferings  justice is of the greatest advantage as well as of the utmost necessity to society the universal practice of it is one of the leading features in the fiction of the golden age the happiness of that period the poets place principaly in this that crimes and injuries were unknown the imperfection and depravity of makind render it impossible that that fiction should be realized incorruptible justice in all the rulers of a nation puts society in the state which approaches nearest to it in that state injuries may be done but they meet with quick and certain redress crimes may be committed but they pass not with impunity though they should be committed by the greatest every person feels that all his rights are safe that if they be attacked by the wickedness of individuals they will be protected by the integrity of the judge the sense of this security keeps every heart at ease marks every face with serenity and fills every life with comfort  if then the necessity and the essential utility of a virtue be the measure of the strictness of its obligation what obligation can be stricter than the obligation of rulers to be just  justice is incumbent on private persons only by virtue of its own obligation yet on them it is indispensibly incumbent it is incumbent on judges by the same obligation but on them it is incumbent also by other obligations it is incumbent by the obligation of fidelity the execution of justice is a trust committed to them it is in effect the positive charge of society to every judge ay it is the express charge of god himself to every judge when divine providence raises him to his office tae heed what ye do for ye judge not for man but for the lord who is with you in the judgment wherefore now let the fear of the lord be upon you take heed and do it for there is no iniquity with the lord nor respect of persons nor taking of gifts   chronicles xix      thus shall ye do in the fear of the lord faithfully and with a perfect heart   chronicles xix    by the acceptance of their office they tacitly but very solemnly pledge their faith to god and to society that they will hear the causes between their brethren and judge righteously between every man and his brother deuteronomy i     should they respect persons in judgment ver     or pervert equity m iii    they would be guilty of falsehood and treachery as well as of injustice  the actual sentiments of mankind own the conclusion that justice is of peculiar obligation upon judges and confirm the reasoning by which we have evinced it justice uncorrupted and even unsuspected is deemed so essential to the character of a judge that a person who disregarded any of its private offices would by the universal voice of mankind be pronounced for that reason unfit to sustain the character of a judge in a judge every species of fraud and injustice would be eclared more unsuitable more atrocious more inexcusable than in another were his private justice perfectly unblamable habitual unrighteousness in his judicial capacity would blast his reputation a single instance of wilful unrighteousness would indelibly fix some stain upon his name the terrors of his power or respect for his rank and office may move men to condemn in silence and to behave with great external deference and may hinder him from discovering how low he stands in the estimation of the worthy but they cannot suppress the sentiments of the honest heart even respect for the office changes its nature and instead of communicating itself to the person who holds it inflames our indignation against him for abusing and disgracing it former ages have afforded instances of judges notoriously arbitrary and unjust they were abhorred by their contemporaries and the impartiality of history has stigmatized them i may say with deeper infamy than the vilest criminal that ever they condemned there have been periods when such judges have been sought for supported and encouraged by the tyranny of governors or by the factious madness of the people but these periods are and ever will be branded as the most disgraceful and infamous periods in the history of human society  if now my brethren it has been proved that justice is the immediate and proximate instrument of accomplishing the very end of the office of rulers magistrates and judges that they alone have opportunity for many important exercises of justice  and that they lie under peculiar obligations to it  may we not fairly conclude that justice is peculiarly their virtue the immediate the proper the most indisensible decorum of their character if this maxim be just the consequence is obvious and undeniable that all magistrates and judges ought to adhere to justice with perfect inflexibility and to practice it with the utmost diligence and the most serupulous exactness this consequence demands not the attention only of a few it fixes the duty not only of perpetual judges nor only of temporary magistrates but also of all who are of juries in public trials or arbitrators in private differences every man may be most men actually actually are sometimes in a situation where justice is in the peculiar manner that has been described incumbent on them whenever they are they render themselves base if they allow their justice to be biassed  sermon iv the first promise of the redeemer genesis iii    and i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shall bruise his heel the prophecy contained in these words is the first opening of christianity the first intimation of the messiah the first promise of redemption to fallen mankind it is on this account remarkable it is remarkable also in respect of its occasion and of the manner in which it was pronounced  god created our first parents in perfect innocence and designed them for immortality the same goodness which determined him to create them and to give them so noble a nature disposed him likewise to make ample provision for their support and their comfort he placed them in the garden of eden which his own hand had adorned and in which he had planted every tree pleasant to the sight and good for food genesis ii    he gave them liberty to feast on all the variety of fruits which it contained and for trial of their obedience forbad the fruit of only one tree in the midst of the garden but forbad them that with this express threatening in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shall surely die ver     unthankful for the abundance which god had allowed them regardless of his prohibition unawed by his threatening first eve solicited by the serpent and next adam seduced by his wife did eat the one forbidden kind of fruit  that it was the devil who tempted eve is acknowledged by all it is the general opinion either that he entered into one of the serpents of the field actuated its body gave it speech and made it his instrument in the temptation or else that he assumed the form of one of them and appeared in its likeness had either of these been the case eve could scarcely have failed to be surprised and terrified the serpents of the field were familiar to her when she heard one of them speaking and speaking rationally she would have immediately run away and knowing him to be only one of the brutes she would not have easily allowed herself to be by him persuaded out of her obedience to god  some are therefore of opinion that the devil did not on this occasion either employ any of the brute serpents or appear in the form of any of them that he did seems indeed to be implied in the words with which the history is introduced now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field genesis iii   but it seeems to be implied in them only as they stand in our translation the original may with equal propriety be rendered now there was a serpent more subtle than any beast or than all the beasts of the field as the words taken by themselves bear this translation so their construction with the sequ seems to require it if we follow the common version by the serpent who was thus subtle we must understand the serpentine kind in general and then the next verb  will have no nominative and he said unto the woman yea has god said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden who said this to the woman not surely the serpentine kind in general but it alone had been mentioned before it must have been some one individual serpent that said so but no such had been so much as hinted at accordingly they who follow this interpretation are forced to allow an ellipsis of the nominative making moses to say the serpentine kind was more subtle than any beast of the field and the devil speaking out of or assuming the form of one individual of that kind said unto the woman etc this is extremely harsh and violent  not one of the beasts of the field but a being far more intelligent than any of them than of them all together a being of an higher order the devil in the account of the creation which moses had before given he had no occasion to mention the devil but being now to relate a transaction in which the devil was the first mover he very properly introduces it with an intimation that there is such a being as the devil but why does he call the devil a serpent if he neither assumed the form of one nor used one as his instrument he might very properly call him a serpent without any regard to his form on account of his subtlety it is common to express a rational being by the name of some animal to whose qualities his disposition bears a resemblance there are instances of it in parts of scripture not the most figurative mat iii   xii    xxiii    luke iii   xiii     tim iv     the serpent has been considered in all ages as an emblem of malice and of cunning the scripture insinuates this very reason for giving the name to the devil he is that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceives the whole world rev xii    he might be called a serpent likewise on account of his own angelic form all the names of intellectual things and spiritual beings are figurative being taken from those material and sensible things which bear an analogy to them seraphs were supposed to resemble the winged fiery serpent in their form and had their name from them on account of this resemblance the fiery serpents which the lord sent among the people of israel in the wilderness are called serpents seraphim  number xxi    and the serpent of brass made by moses on that occasion is called simply a seraph  ver    the devil probably appeared to eve in the form of a seraph she took him for an angel of light conversed with him as such and therefore listened to him without surprise without suspicion and was easily persuaded by him it was this serpent metaphorically so called that tempted eve it is this one individual serpent the devil not the whole serpentine kind nor any particular species of it that is spoken of through the whole of this history this supposition agrees perfectly with the whole tenor of the history and clars it from many difficulties in which the other suppositions have involved it  soon after our first parents had sinned they heard the voice of jehovah genesis iii    they had often heard it and always hitherto it had been pleasant to them but now it was terrible they endeavored to hide themselves god found them out and extorted a confession from them that they had disobeyed their maker first adam owned that he had eaten but accused the woman of having given him the fruit next eve confessed that she had eaten but laid the blame upon the serpent the serpent that serpent probably pointing to him or casting her eye upon him beguiled me and i did eat ver        this serpent the tempter was present either detained by the power of god or of choice exulting in his success eager to overhear the doom of the deluded pair to enjoy his victory and to triumph over them  behold now god appearing in the schechinah the two apostate parents of the human race and the seraph who had tempted them to apostasy stand before him he sits in judgment and passes a separate sentence upon each he passes sentence first upon the tempter ver        this was fit in order to check his exultation it made him feel that in reducing them to misery he had reduced himself to greater misery if we consider the sentence as passed on the brute serpents it is trifing and liable to endless difficulties but if we consider it as respecting only the devil it has great propriety and dignity and every part of it is expressed with very striking beauty he appeared now as he had appeared while tempting eve in the seraphic form and all the expressions used in the judgment pronounced against him have a double reference to that seraphic form and to the serpentine form which it resembles and the lord god said unto the serpent not unto the serpents of the field but unto the serpent who now stood before him the same individual being who is spoken of through the whole history to him solely the whole sentence is directed without the most distant intimation that any part of it regarded the serpents of the field because thou have done this thou not a brute serpent a brute serpent neither did nor could have done it but the one seraphic serpent the devil he it was who had beguiled eve therefore says god thou the same individual serpent the devil art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field thou art devoted to a punishment which far superior as thine original nature was to theirs shall render thee more vile abject and miserable than the meanest of the brutes more an object of gods displeasure and of the hatred of all good beings than any other creature is upon thy belly shall thou go this is not meant against the brute serpents it is not true of all of them for flying serpents it is said continued to exist after this of the other serpents it would have been impertinent for to them going on their bellies was essential from the creation it was directed only to the seducer and if it be explained according to the usage of scripture style it will appear in respect of him to have great truth and propriety it was directed to him in his seraphic form which resembled the serpentine the manner of expression is chosen with a view to that resemblance and intimates his punishment in allusion to it it intimates that he was now as much degraded as if his seraphic form were converted into that of a grovelling serpent as if from flying on high he were reduced to creep upon his belly this figurative expression at least one perfectly similar to it is used elsewhere in scripture and had become proverbial to signify a reduction to the lowest affliction and humiliation it is very deep affliction which the psalmist intends to describe when he says our soul is bowed down to the dust our belly cleaves unto the earth psalm xliv    it is what in the preceding verses he had called affliction oppression being killed all day long counted as sheep for the slaughter cast off by god ver           its simple meaning in this curse is thou shall be degraded from all thine original dignity and celestial glory thou shall lose all the prerogatives of thy nature thou shall be cast down to shame and infamy and reduced to an abject and vile condition and dust shall thou eat all the days of thy life the meaning is not thou shall feed wholly upon dust but thou shall lick up dust together with thy food still the allusion to serpents whom the devils seraphic form resembled is beautifully kept up but it is not a sentence pronounced against brute serpents it was true before of them that they licked up dust along with their food and this is not peculiar to them it is common to them with all animals that feed from off the ground here too the terms are metaphorical and proverbial but they are not unusual in scripture they convey an idea similar to what is expressed in the preceding clause they contain an amplification of that idea they signify a state of bondage captivity imprisonment and the lowest depression it is such a state that micah means when he prophecies that the nations shall lick the dust like a serpent chap ii     it is a state in which they should be conounded ver     and move out of their holes like worms out of the earth ver    there is a similar expression in one of the psalms i have eaten ashes like brad psalm vii   which from the title of the psalm from the occasion to which it is referred and from many plain descriptions of bondage and distress through the whole of it the title is a prayer of the afflicted when he is overwelmed it is generally considered as a lamentation on account of the mieries of the jews during the babylonian captivity the state lamented under the figurative expression now quoted is described in other terms answering precisely to our explication of its import i am in trouble  my days are consumed like smoke and my bones are burnt as an earth mine eart is smitten and withered like grass  by reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin  mine nies reproach me all the day and they that are mad against me are sworn against me  thou have cast me down  the stones of zion are thrown down and it is laid in dust and in giving deliverance the lord is represented as regarding the prayer of the deitute  hearing the groaning of the prisoner and loosing those that are apppointed to die  has undeniably the same signification david prophesying of the messiah says his enemies shall lick the dust psalm lxxii    and and isaiah foretells that in the completion of the messiahs kingdom dust shall be in the serpents meat chap lxv     both probably had this original curse directly in their eye and to intimate that they had purposely retained the metaphorical terms of it which imply this plain sentiment that the devil was to be thenceforth in a state of the most abject depression and the most wretched captivity groaning under present anguish and overwhelmed with dreadful expectations in terms therefore metaphorical indeed but the precise import of which may be ascertained by the scripture language in other passages the tmpter is sentencd to a state of miserable degradation and bondage to the very state which peter describes in plainer terms in terms extremely unlike to those used in this sentence but surprisingly synonymous with them god spared not the angels that sinned but cast them down to ell and delivered them into chains of darkness to be reserved unto judgment   pt ii   this passge is an exact commntary on the words of moses corresponding to them clause to cue moes describes the tempter as a superior intelligence and intimates that he appeared in the form of a sph peter spk of  mes says that god pronounced the tmpter   above all cale and above ery east of the field peter says god  no the angel that is he treated them with severity and incted a heavy  upon them moses says upon thy lly  t go thou  cast down into the lowe miliation and  per s he est them down into ll moses says dst shlt t a ll t  of y le words which imply abject bondage and captivity peter explains them in this very sense he delivered them to  of darkness peter intimates that even this was not properly eir state of punishment but that they are  into  moses hits not at this in the  part of the sentence but he does intimate it in  lar part wn he speak of  the     so far the sentence was absolute it expressed simply the condition to which the tempter was instantly degraded the remaining part of it is expressive of the condition of the devil in relation to mankind in expressing it god introduced a promise comfortable to man this was great kindness to our first parents by this their fears were alleviated and a beam of consolation was darted into their guilty hearts before themselves were sentenced to sorrow labor and mortality it is contained in the text and i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shall bruise his heel  when this promise was first delivered it was no doubt only like a light that shines in a dark place   pet i     it was just sufficient to relieve the thickness of the gloom to let in a twinkling ray of hope to give an indefinite conception of some comfortable and happy event a conception analogous to the indistinct view of bodies in a glimmering light our ist parents would naturally conclude from this promise that the devils malicious designs against them were to be in a great measure defeated but they had not a full conception either of the extent and consequences of his designs or of the nature and manner of the promised deliverance from them the promise was however admirably adapted to the circumstances of his temptation and to the apprehensions which they could not fail to entertain he hoped perhaps by deceiving the woman to bring on them immediate death and extinguish the whole species at once and they would readily fear this but god promises that the woman shall have seed the devil had deceived her under the specious pretense of friendship and expected to have gained her wholly and firmly to spouse his cause and interests but war is proclaimed between him and his seed and the woman and her seed he had intended the utter ruin of mankind and rejoiced in the thought that he had accomplished it but it is declared that he had accomplished his own destruction and that though he should have some success in the combat its issue should be much more fatal to himself than to his adversary the import of this promise has been illustrated by posterior prophesies and still more by the event so that it is made to shine to us like the day star with regard both to the succeeding prophesies and the descriptions of the event some are expressed in terms similar to those used here on purpose to show that they belong to the same subject and others are expressed in very different terms either in proper words or in dissimilar metaphors that by comparing them all together we may the better apprehend the precise meaning of all the terms and understand the whole subject more perfectly examined by this light the text will be found not only to contain a promise of the redeemer which is commonly observed in it but also which is not so commonly observed to represent in brief but with great exactness the whole religious and moral state of this world from the fall of man to the consummation of all things  in what remains of this discourse i shall illustrate the several particulars of this promise and then make some reflections on it  first it is here intimated that the woman should have seed and it is intimated in such a manner as to imply an accurate prediction of the miraculous birth of the redeemer  our first parents probably apprehended and the tempter hoped that god would condemn them to immediate death while they were trembling under this apprehension they hear god declare that the woman shall have seed this was comfortable to them it implied that their lives were to be prolonged at the time they would perhaps conceive these words to mean only any descendant from them that eve expected the person thus promised in cain her eldest son is by some thought to be intimated by what she said at his birth which they render i have gotten a man the lord genesis iv    it was even merciful in god to give them only an obscure and general intimation of the great deliverer had they known that he was not to appear till after so many ages it might have sunk them in dejection  but however obscure their conception of him may have been this intimation is very precise it is an exact description of a wonderful event of the extraordinary and miraculous conception of the savior of mankind the posterity is always reckoned after the man this expression the seed of the woman is without a parallel in scripture the most learned jews hold it to be wholly unaccountable but their minds are as the apostle affirms   cor iii        blinded and there is a vail upon their hearts in the reading of the old testament else singular as the expression is it needed not appear inexplicable to them for they have in their own scriptures a prediction expressed indeed in different words but which in sense perfectly coincides with it and explains it behold says isaiah chap vii     a virgin shall conceive and bear a son that person who was born of a virgin is with the strictest propriety called the seed of the woman he is what no other ever was or shall be the seed of the woman only not of the man the expression would indeed be improper and inexplicable if there were not such an event corresponding to it and if there be such an event this singular expression was doubtless chosen on purpose to mark its peculiarity  it is in the gospel that we find that wonderful event jesus of nazarth was born of the virgin mary having been conceived of the holy ghost matthew mentions this chap i     0  luke gives a particular account of it chap i        paul takes notice of it in terms which point out jesus as the person designed in this first prophy when the fullness of the time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman gal iv    he had no father but god god himself by his own immediate operation as the psalist had foretold prepared a body for him hb x   this eent absolutely singular without a parallel was in terms which exactly suit it foretold sour thousand years before it happened in the very infancy of the world to the first human pair  secondly it is foretold in this prediction that there should be a perpetual opposition between this person and the devil satan was already the declared enemy of mankind and one born of a woman is by the appointment of god himself to enter the lists with him and war against him i will put enmity says god between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed satan probably hoped that the matter was absolutely determined and our first parents inally and irretrievably ruined by the overthrow which he had already given them and they feared that it was so it must have yielded them some comfort even to know that there was still room for a contest  these words are addressed to the same serpent who had been spoken of all along being thus addressed to oe they cannot refer to all the brute srpents they rfer not to any of them there is no greater antipathy between mankind and them than between mankind and all other frightful and destructive animals and it is not mankind but christ jesus that is here principally intended the devil who had deceived eve the prince of the apostate spirits is the serpent here meant by his seed we must understand such progeny as an angel can have his seed dnotes primarily the vil spirits who were partakers in his apostasy or his followers in dfection from god it includes also wicked men they are corrupted by his temptation they are formed by his influence and they bear his image and on this account they are in scripture called the children of the devil and as such opposed to good men who are named the children of god  john iii    0  these are the parties on one side of this contest  the parties on the other side are the woman and her seed it is jesus christ who is meant by the seed of the woman the manner of expression points to him he is the principal in this opposition to the devil the woman herself is also mentioned eve could never certainly think without detestation of the devil who had so maliciously deceived her but by the woman is not meant eve alone christ was not the seed of eve exclusive of adam his virgin mother was equally descended from them both the woman is not mentioned here because she was to bear any peculiar enmity to satan her enmity is common to all of her posterity who resemble her in detesting the devil and his works but she is mentioned because it was she that had been deceived by satan and perhaps chiefly to give occasion for predicting him who was peculiarly the seed of the woman accordingly in the following clauses the mention of the woman is entirely dropped and only her seed spoken of good men are indeed under christ engaged in this contest but their being engaged in it is not directly intimated by the expressions here used it is only remotely and by a metonymy implied as they may be considered according to the representations of scripture in other places as members of christ and fighting in his strength  it is here foretold then that there would be a perpetual and irreconcilable opposition between the devil evil spirits and wicked men on the one hand and christ on the other hand from the moment of the fall it has been so in every sense in which the prediction can be understood  in the strictest sense it intimates a personal contest between these parties and in this sense it was literally fulfilled devils and wicked men have from the beginning exerted themselves in propagating idolatry and vice and overwhelming the world with misery that the son of god was personally engaged even before his incarnation in counteracting their designs there are many hints in scripture his goings forth have been from of old from the days of the age and he continued to give them until the time that she who was abearing had borne this is the true sense of mic v      but after she had borne after the son of god had become the seed of the woman there was a personal contest in the properest sense the devil himself tempted christ in the wilderness and by his instruments he labored incessantly to defeat his views to raise prejudices against his person his doctrine his actions and his miracles herod endeavored to murder him in his infancy the jews persecuted him all his days and at last crucified him in so doing they showed that they were as our savior on this very account calls them serpents mat xxiii     a generation of vipers mat iii   xii    luke iii    of their father the devil john viii         they did his works and they were instigated by him by the same instigation judas betrayed christ to death satan had entered into him luke xxii   john xiii       and moved him to it on the other hand jesus christ resisted the devil and during the whole of his life in the flesh opposed his designs and interests casting out unclean spirits healing those diseases which sin had brought into the world combating the vices of wicked men and till his hour was come eluding and defeating their malicious attempts against himself since his exaltation he is invisible but he is represented in scripture as the head of the church constantly employing his power for promoting true religion virtue and happiness and the devil is represented as the ruler of the kingdom of darkness and along with wicked men intent upon and active in opposing him and promoting the contrary views  but the words of the prediction need not be restricted to such a personal conduct the devil is here spoken of as the had of the apostasy who had become a rebel against god set up a kingdom in direct opposition to gods kingdom a kingdom of wickedness and labored to spread sin and misery and his offspring are considered as acting under him in carrying on his plan when these persons are therefore in this way mentioned the cause in which they are engaged may by a very common figure be understood christ is here predicted precisely as the head of mans recovery from the moment of the fall he was by divine appointment the governor of gods kingdom here below the kingdom of righteousness and felicity and therefore though he alone be mentioned both they who are the subjects of his kingdom and the cause which is its great object may by the same figure be intended by this very figure all good is ascribed to god and all evil to the devil this implies the same idea which we suppose in the text and this is the common language of scripture these two kingdoms the kingdom of satan and the kingdom of god of which christ is the immediate governor are contrary and irreconcilable in every point in their natures in their views and in the principles which their respective votaries act upon it is here predicted that neither of the two should absolutely prevail in the present world that there should be a perpetual struggle between them the prediction has been precisely accomplished it is an exact description of the present mixed state of things in which good and evil virtue and vice happiness and misery though in different proportions yet still are blended together and counteract each other  it has been accomplished in the character and condition of every individual of the human race every human character is imperfect and mixed since the fall there has not been a single mere man either uniformly good or uniformly bad the worst men are not wholly destitute of all good qualities and the best are not altogether free from vice in some men very great virtues have been united with very great vices in the wicked sin is predominant and goodness in the righteous and some waver so irresolutely between the two or seem to possess them in such equal degrees that it is hard to say to which class they belong in every man there is a law in the members warring against the law of the mind romans vii     in every man the flesh lusts against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other gal v     conscience and good affections oppose corrupt appetites and passions and are opposed by them they instigate us by turns the condition of every man is mixed pleasure and pain joy and sorrow prosperity and adversity are mingled in his cup the sufferings of some and the enjoyments of others are great and many but none ever passed his life either in pure happiness or in unallayed misery  it has been accomplished likewise in the general state of the world in all ages and nations there has been a mixture of good and bad men united in the same societies in the same families but pursuing opposite plans of conduct to both there has often been one event and all things have come alike to all eccles ix    in some parts of the world idolatry and corruption have prevailed in others true religion has been established and has produced considerable effects the vices and the prejudices of men oppose the prevalence of truth and goodness and these in their turn check vice and error the wicked hate the righteous lay snares for their virtue and study to afflict them the righteous is clean contrary to their doings he was made to reprove their thoughts wisdom ii        in every period of society these things have taken place in the most uncultivated nations there have appeared virtues rough but bold and active the civilization of mankind while it refines their virtues too often likewise multiplies their vices and introduces new species of corruption in the early ages the piety of the patriarchs formed a contrast to the depravity of the generations in which they lived and maintained a struggle with it the old world was corrupt before god genesis vi    noah alone was a preacher of righteousness   pet ii    and condemned the world heb xi    in sodom just lot was vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked   pet ii    and he seemed to them as one that mocked genesis xix    in the heathen world a few disapproved and in some instances opposed the general corruption but they were baffled by its power the israelites enjoyed a true religion but idolatry overspread the rest of the world and upon themselves that true religion had not universal or constant influence good men were raised up to reprove their defections but they were disregarded and persecuted by those who would not be reclaimed even the full erection of the kingdom of the redeemer in the gospel dispensation has not annihilated this promiscuous state of things hell and earth devils and wicked men both jews and heathens united their efforts to prevent the reception of the gospel and to perseute all who preached or professed it and since it was established the cunning of the enemy and the ignorance and ill designs of men have conspired to ully its beauty to enervate its power and to defeat its success by adulterating and corrupting it by traducing and maltreating its genuine adherents and by promoting inidelity and irreligion but by the favor of divine providn by the invisible but efficacious exercise of that power which is committed to jesus christ and by the undaunted fortitude and the indefatigable labors of the apostles and other good men the gospel met with an extensive reception gave a check to false religion and evil practices and has since then been always in some degree retained has been at times reformed from corruptions has had some good influence on the general state of the world and has rendered many truly virtuous and holy christianity is wholly calculated for opposing vice and promoting purity and goodness and as long as there is wickedness in the world it will prompt men to resist this holy religion every one that does evil hates the light neither comes to the light lest his deeds should be reproved john iii  0  righteousness and unrighteousness christ and belial are as contrary and irreconcilable as light and darkness   cor vi        and like these they divide this world between them  such is and always has been the actual state of this lower world that this would be its state was predicted in the very beginning of the world the scripture always supposes this to be the state of the world and often expresses it in terms which correspond to those of this prediction and point it out as the fulfillment of it to the eye of sense men are the only actors in the seen but the scripture constantly represents it as carried on likewise by invisible actors the scripture considers this world in the precise light of its being gods world and governed by him and both the predictions of the old testament and the history of the new represent the government of it as committed to the lord jesus christ and the virtues of good men as supported by him the scripture represents the devil as opposing the laws and the interests of the kingdom of god and of christ as seducing wicked men and making them his willing instruments in promoting his designs as corrupting the church by sowing tares matt xiii        as tempting and afflicting good men it therefore calls him the enemy ib and ver    luke x     the adversary and describes him as a roaring lion walking about seeking whom he may devour   pet v    and good men while endeavoring to avoid vice and adhere to truth and goodness it represents as resisting the devil ver   jam iv    standing against his wiles and wrestling not only against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places ephesians vi         two other particulars are here foretold that the issue of this contest shall be fatal to the devil and his cause and that he shall notwithstanding have some successes in the course of it these particulars shall be considered afterward in the mean time brethren since the present life of good men is such a warfare take unto you the whole armor of god that ye may be able to stand in the evil day and having done all to stand ephesians vi     be strong in the lord and in the power of his might ver  0   sermon v the first promise of the redeemer genesis iii    and i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between they seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shall bruise his heel for understanding the meaning of this prediction and perceiving its accomplishment it is necessary to know to whom the sentence of which it is a part was addressed and against whom it was pronounced the preceding discourse was therefore introduced by showing that it regards not the brute serpents neither the whole kind nor any particular species of them but solely the devil who had tempted eve and who is called the serpent on account of his malicious cunning and probably too on account of his own seraphic form it is thought to have resembled the serpentine and if it did it gave a natural occasion both for the name by which the devil is here mentioned and for the metaphorical expressions employed in the sentence pronounced against him  the first part of that sentence intimates the condition to which the devil was immediately condemned and in metaphorical but expressive terms describes it as abject vile and miserable the second part of it declares what would thenforth be the condition of the devil in relation to mankind and it contains a prophetical delineation general but very precise of the religious and moral state of this lower world from the fall of man to the consummation of all things it is delivered in these words and i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shall bruise his heel the particulars of this prediction are four i proposed to explain them in their order  first it is here intimated that our first parents instead of being subjected to immediate death should have posterity the expression the seed of the woman runs through all the clauses of the text and it is an expression which naturally implies the miraculous conception of the great deliverer which points to and had an exact completion in jesus christ who being born of the virgin mary was the seed of the woman only not of the man  secondly it is here declared that there would be a perpetual opposition between the promised deliverer of mankind and the devil who had seduced them into apostasy i will put enmity says god between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed these words may signify a personal contest between that deliverer on the one hand and evil spirits and wicked men on the other and such a contest there was especially after that deliverer had become the seed of the woman in the days of christs flesh the words may likewise signify a struggle between the two opposite causes the cause of virtue and happiness of which christ is by gods appointment the head and the cause of wickedness and misery which is patronised by the devil and espoused by vicious men considered in this light they contain an accurate description of the mixed state of things which has actually taken place in this lower world ever since the fall virtues and vices good and bad qualities are united in the character and pleasures and pains enjoyments and sufferings are blended in the condition of every individual of the human species in every age in every nation in every society good and bad men live promiscuously together sharing in the same blessings involved in the same calamities but actuated by opposite principles and engaged in contrary courses i formerly explained these two parts of the prediction  thirdly we are here assured that the issue of this contest shall be fatal to the devil and his cause  this part of the prediction is expressed in terms which might agree to the brute serpents it the seed of the woman shall bruise thy head but it refers not to them to have foretold that men should now and then kill a serpent by crushing its head would have been trivial and unworthy of the occasion it has a much more important meaning the terms are only borrowed from brute serpents to be metaphorically applied to the seraph who had beguiled eve the metaphor is perspicuous and strong it is in the head of the serpent that its poison lies and the crushing of its head immediately and most certainly kills it the figurative expression here used has therefore this plain meaning that the descendant of the woman now promised shall obtain a complete victory over the devil deprive him of his power to hurt abolish his dominion and influence and finally punish and destroy him  he had succeeded in deceiving the woman she now appeared weak and wretched in his eyes but this very woman it is foretold shall be his destruction from her a person is to spring who shall reduce him to greater weakness and deeper wretchedness he had hoped to become absolute lord of this lower world but as it was declared in the preceding clause that his usurped dominion over it would be always incomplete it is here foretold that this dominion shall be at last totally overthrown our first parents could not but understand his designs against them so far as to perceive that he had seduced them into sin and that he had intended to subject them to death and to deprive them of the happiness for which they were made when therefore his destruction by means of the womans seed was predicted they must have seen that the prediction implied an assurance that his malicious contrivances against mankind would be defeated their sin forgiven and themselves delivered from death and restored to happiness it led them to expect a redeemer in human nature who would recover them from that state into which through the temptation of the devil they had fallen  this part of the prediction has not received its full accomplishment it regards the final issue of the contest proclaimed in the preceding clause and which was to continue through the whole of the present state till that contest therefore be concluded till the present state of things come to an end the accomplishment of this promise must remain incomplete but it has been already fulfilled in some part it is fulfilled in every advantage which christ obtains over the devil and in every advantage which the cause of virtue gains over the cause of vice so far it is illustrated by the event at the same time in other passages of scripture we have many descriptions of the issue of that contest and of the manner in which it shall be brought about which render this first intimation of it much clearer to us than it could be to our first parents some of these descriptions are expressed in so plain an allusion to the text as to direct us to regard the subject of them as intended by it and fulfilling it and others are expressed in terms fit for throwing light on those which are employed here and rendering their meaning easily intelligible  god promises that in the personal contest which had been just now foretold between christ on the one side and devils and wicked men on the other side christ should have the advantage and at last obtain a complete victory  already he has had great advantage in every assault which the devil made upon him personally in his state of incarnation christ was conqueror when the devil tempted him he baffled all his temptations he cast multitudes of devils out of those who were possessed by them and gave his disciples also power to cast them out in his name thus depriving evil spirits of their dominion over mankind and rendering them subservient to the glory of his miracles in reference to this kind of miracles he says i beheld satan as lightning fall from heaven luke x     the terms in which he expresses the powers granted to his desciples are remarkably analogous to those of the text and point out these miracles as fulfilments of it behold i give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you ver     these miracles are represented also as a binding of satan mat xii    mark iii     when christ appeared demoniacs seem to have been very common if at that period they had been more common than before it would have been taken notice of with surprise since that time it is certain that they have been much less frequent this is an instance in which christ has given a signal check to the power of satan in spite of all opposition christ finished the work given him to do on earth he adhered to truth and goodness to the end and when he died a martyr to them he triumphed over the devil and all his agents by rising again from the dead and ascending into heaven his ascension the scripture assures us was the celebration of his triumph his accession to the kingdom here foretold it assures us that when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive ephesians iv    that having by his cross spoiled principalities and powers he made a show of them openly triumphing over them it col ii        and that he is set at gods right hand in the heavenly places far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come ephesians i  0      but it is at the end of the world that christs victory will be complete the preceding verse described the devils present slate this clause foretells his final punishment even that judgment to which peter and jude inform us that the fallen angels are reserved   pet ii   jude    it will be such as comes up to the full import of bruising the serpents head at the end of the world christ will appear in the glorious character of the universal judge and will condemn the devils to perdition he will cast them says john into the lake of fire and brimstone where they shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever rev xx  0  then too the judge will condemn all wicked men who have suffered themselves to be corrupted by the devil and have cooperated with him in his cause to the same punishment with him he will send them away into the everlasting fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels mat xxv     where they shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the lord and from the glory of his power   thessalonians i     god here foretells likewise that the cause of christ the cause of truth and righteousness shall all along gain some advantages over the opposite cause of satan the cause of idolatry and vice and shall finally triumph over it  in conformity to this prediction idolatry and ignorance of god have never prvailed so universally but that some saint rays of religious knowledge have now and then shone forth in one part of the world or another when they were too weak to lead men off from the practices of false religion they notwithstanding often exposed its absurdity and subjected it to just contempt some of the pagans condemned the worship with which they complied others acted a better part than was consistent with the religion which they professed the idolatry of the ancient world was the worship of evil spirits and wicked men the things which the gentiles sacrificed they sacrificed to devils and not to god   cor x  0  the religion of christ banished this idolatry wherever it was embraced it turned men to god from idols to serve the living and true god   thessalonians i    this was to lay waste the kingdom of the devil and withdraw his subjects from their allegiance to him the scripture represents it in this very light it represents those gentiles who were converted by the gospel as turned from the power of satan unto god act xxvi     it is probably the establishment of christianity on the ruins of pagan idolatry which john foresaw in prophetic vision and which he describes in metaphors like to those employed in the text there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceives the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before god day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony rev xii        even in the christian church indeed satan has introduced idolatry agreeably to the prediction of the apostle paul the man of sin has been revealed the son of perdition whose coming is after the working of satan with all power and signs and lying wonders and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness   thessalonians ii      0  but the same apostle foretells that this wicked one the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming ver    as yet the prediction is not accomplished fully but the accomplishment is far advanced a reformation from popery has spread over many nations where the form of popery is still retained a great part of its power is lost in due time the apostles oracle shall be completely verified by the total abolition of idolatry from the christian church the period foreseen by john shall come when it shall be proclaimed babylon the great is fallen is fallen and she shall be utterly burnt with fire for strong is the lord god who judges her rev xviii       christs victory over the devil implies also the prevalence of virtue over vice this cannot generally take place in the present state it had been already foretold that the present state would be always mixed yet in many particular instances virtue has prevailed in all ages there have been many good men and in every good man virtue is predominant integrity has often triumphed over all the cunning and all the contrivances of wickedness it is the very design of the coming and the religion of christ to promote virtue and discourage vice ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins   john iii    sin is the work of the devil he it was who introduced sin into the world and for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil ver    by his religion multitudes have been recovered out of the snare of the devil who were taken captive by him at his will   timothy ii     there seem to be intimations in the scripture that the religion of christ shall in some future periods exert its power more perfectly and more universally and produce far more conspicuous effects in the course of christs reign an angel is represented by the prophetical evangelist as coming down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand and laying hold of the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and satan and binding him a thousand years and casting him into the bottomless pit and shutting him up and setting a seal upon him that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years should be fulfilled rev xx        this doubtless implies some great restraint which shall at some time hereafter even within the compass of the present world be laid upon the power and machinations of the devil  but we are certain that at the end of this world all gods elect shall be gathered together mat xxiv    mark xiii     the living changed   cor xv        and the dead raised perfect and immortal then shall they be delivered from all the consequences of the fall from sin and guilt and the grave and shall reign in life by jesus christ romans  then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory   cor xv     then death and hell shall be cast into the lake of fire rev xx     to be there consumed then there shall be new heavens and a new earth wherein dwells righteousness   pet iii     there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain rev xxi    and there shall be no more curse but the servants of god and of the lamb shall reign for ever and ever chap xxii      by this extirpation of sin and death and misery the devils contrivances against mankind shall be finally defeated we are assured that the early prediction shall be thus fulfilled for it is written that christ must reign till he has put all enemies under his feet   cor xv      fourthly it is foretold in the text that though the seed of the woman should finally destroy the serpent and his seed yet they would have some lesser successes against him and his cause in the course of the combat  this is foretold in terms which might be applicable to the brute serpent thou shall bruise or bite his heel jacob says with a similar allusion dan shall be a serpent by the way an adder in the path that biteth the horses heels genesis xlix     this is a manner of attack natural to the serpent its make scarcely permits its rising higher and it will very readily bite the heel of him who is crushing its head with his foot the sentiment is obvious enough though the terms be figurative the heel is not a vital part a wound in it however painful it may be is not necessarily mortal some smaller hurt is therefore intimated it is intimated that in destroying the power of the devil the seed of the woman should receive a wound but not a fatal wound not one inconsistent with a full victory at last  this part of the prophecy has had its accomplishment with respect both to christ himself and to his cause  christ himself was far from escaping all hurt in the combat but the hurt which he received was such as may be justly represented by the bruising of his heel it answered not the malicious intention of the devil it proved not fatal on the contrary it was the great means of defeating the contrivances of the devil the sufferings of christs incarnate state were manifold and grievous and he died a painful and ignominious death it was by the things which he suffered that he was made perfect and became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him heb v      even when they nailed him to the cross they wounded only his mortal part the divine and spiritual part remained unhurt and he rose from the dead to eternal life and glory and dominion in his death his enemies thought that they had vanquished him but it was by his death that he completed his victory over them it was through death that he destroyed him that had the power of death that is the devil heb ii     his death was the sacrifice for our sins and obtained the remission of them it was the ransom of our forfeited lives it reversed the forfeiture by purchasing our resurrection from the dead it was the price of our salvation and bought for us not immortality on earth but an immortality of happiness in heaven it was because he became obedient unto death even the death of the cross that god has highly exalted him and given him phil ii    all that authority and power by which he will at last totally abolish the dominion of satan and condemn him and all his angels and all his adherents to everlasting destruction  that christ should suffer in obtaining our deliverance from the malice of the devil is expressly affirmed in the text and must have been understood by our first parents to be implied in it that his sufferings contributed to our deliverance that they were an atonement for the sins of the world is not necessarily implied in this prediction nor could our first parents learn merely from the expressions here employed but even they were perhaps taught to perceive that this also was implied in the prediction it is probable that animal sacrifices were instituted at this very time that animal sacrifices were originally of divine institution has been often assted and seems to be proved by many conclusive arguments soon after the fall it is certain they were in use abe offered an animal sacrifice and was accepted for it therefore they had been instituted before that period but in all the interval there was no season so proper for the institution as immediately after the fall when god appeared to adam and eve and passed sentence on them sacrifice was instituted as the means of obtaining the pardon of sin and the first sin had at that season been just committed the lives of our first parents were forfeited by it this was the fit time to substitute a sacrifice in their place the redeemer was now promised what time more proper for the institution of a rite which is confessedly typical of him that this was the very time there is a circumstance in the history which seems to indicate just after passing sentence on the first pair god clothed them with skins it is probable that no animals had died of themselves before the fall man got not permission to kill them for food till after the flood what then are the skins with which they were clothed so likely to have been as the skins of the animals which at the institution of sacrifice god had appointed them to kill for the first offering  and if they were the institution of them would throw light on what is here said illustrate the nature of the redeemers sufferings here foretold unfold the manner of the redemption of the world and show that it should be accomplished by the seed of the woman suffering and dying to make atonement for us while god in words promised a suffering redeemer he at the same time instituted sacrifice as a type of him to explain the promise to keep alive the expectation of him to promote reliance on him through all the ages which divine wisdom had decreed should pass before christ was actually offered up to be in every repetition of it a standing prophecy of the future redemption that to this men in all succeeding generations might have recourse by faith for the remission of their sins agreeable to this is the account which the apostle gives of abels sacrifice the first that is recorded in scripture he offered it by faith heb xi    by faith in this promise of a redeemer with expectation of and dependence upon him whom his sacrifice shadowed forth  against the cause of christ likewise the devil often has and through the whole course of the present state shall continue to have considerable success yet only such success as may be represented by the bruising of the heel in the idolatry of the heathen world the devil reigned for many ages in it he and his angels were worshipped and served as gods till the coming of christ he seemed to carry all before him many and gross corruptions have been introduced into the christian religion have spread wide and continued long uncorrected the son of perdition has opposed and exalted himself above all that is called god or that is worshipped so that he as god sits in the temple of god showing himself that he is god   thessalonians ii      and he shall continue to sit for some time longer in all ages of the world iniquity has abounded the wicked have at times been very many and the righteous very few in the purest societies and the purest periods multitudes of bad men have been intermixed with the good the vicious are often prosperous and the virtuous depressed the best of men are imperfect in particular instances sin triumphs over all their grace the most cautious some times give place to the devil ephesians iv     and he gets an advantage of them   cor ii     wicked spirits and wicked men often fill the righteous with sorrows and expose them to sufferings the devil casts them into prison and into tribulalation rev ii  0  satans first contrivance against mankind was so far successful that in adam all die   cor xv     but all these successes of satan in the prevalence of vice and misery are slight and temporary they shall not only be reversed at the last they are always opposed and often checked in the present state pagan idolatry was often exposed and often reproved and has already been banished from many nations by the light of the gospel and shall be banished from many more christianity even when it is corrupted retains force enough to give some check to evil works when the corruption of it is most general still some escape being infected and after an interval it shines forth again in purity and in power the good oppose the devices of the wicked make them ashamed of them and prevent some part of the mischief which they would otherwise produce virtue is sometimes honored and rewarded even in the present life in all good men grace though sometimes baffled prevails against corrupt lusts and gradually mortifies them more and more they repent of their sins obtain the forgiveness of them and become more circumspect and blameless in virtuous practice when satan is permitted to afflict them it is only that they may be tried rev ii  0  when he has great wrath against them it is because he knows that he has but a short time chap xii     their sorrows are succeeded by solid and permanent joys and contribute to them the god of peace thus bruises satan under their feet romans xvi  0  they die not for ever christ will raise them up at the last day to a new and glorious life  such is the first promise of a redeemer to the fallen world delivered in the sentence which god passed on the devil by whose temptation it had fallen it is in the manner of the eastern nations and of the early ages expressed in figurative terms borrowed from the serpent for which the tempters seraphic form gave a natural occasion but the figurative terms used in it imply very clearly  an intimation of the miraculous conception of the redeemer  a declaration that there should be a stated and permanent opposition between him and the devil and that in consequence of this the present world should be a mixed and chequered state  an assurance that the redeemer shall at last obtain a complete victory over the devil defeat his contrivances against mankind and make virtue and happiness to triumph for evermore  and a prediction that in effecting this he should undergo sufferings and death for us and be exposed to some lesser hurts in respect of his followers and his cause what these particulars import and how they have been accomplished i have endeavored to explain  the reflections on this subject with which i proposed to conclude my discourse shall be very short    the whole of this subject shows the greatness of gods grace and kindness to men every part of the curse pronounced on the tempter spoke comfort to our first parents god gave them this comfort that they might not despond he prevented their fear of instant death he assured them not only that they should live to have posterity but that among them there should be one great person the redeemer of his race and that through him mankind should at last triumph and their seducer be utterly destroyed god suffered not himself to be an object of mere terror to sinful man for a single day in the very hour of the provocation he allowed not mankind to consider themselves as rejected by him he gave them hope that they might have a strong motive to return to him by repentance and to study to regain his favor to us christians he has given stronger hope by a fuller revelation of our redemption already accomplished in this hope let us rejoice and let our alacrity in endeavoring to please god be in proportion to the brightness of our hope    what has been said may confirm our faith in christ and his gospel the prophecy which we have considered is an intimation of the most mavelous events and they have come to pass they are the reverse of what the devil with all his knowledge looked for and of what with all his cunning he intended by his machinations yet they were exactly foretold in the very beginning of the world who could have foreseen them at that time but god they are his appointment jesus christ is the deliverer here predicted to him every character of the deliverer belongs he was born of a virgin he is in direct and irreconcilable opposition to the devil and his cause he has already greatly broken the power of satan and has revealed to us in what manner he will totally destroy it and he has suffered and died in accomplishing this great design on him we may safely depend as the promised seed the restorer of the lost world the conqueror over satan sin and death    what has been said tends to give us a just conception of the state of things in this present world it is obviously a mixed and imperfect state and it has many appearances of irregularity and confusion in it no character is wholly consistent or of a piece in it virtuous and vicious men are intermingled and connected together by many ties in it neither is virtue uniformly rewarded nor vice uniformly punished in innumerable instances good and evil are promiscuously distributed to the righteous and the wicked and in many instances the wicked flourish and prosper while the righteous are unsuccessful and afflicted these appearances of disorder have been remarked in all ages they have been urged by some as objections against the justice of divine providence and they have sometimes perplexed the most modest and serious enquirers into the ways of god but this very state of things the text informs us is the appointment of god himself in the very beginning of the world he declared that he had appointed it being his appointment it is unalterable in vain we fret and murmur at it his sovereign will demands our submission being his appointment it must be wise and just and gracious the text shows it to be eminently such it was when the parents of the human race had merited instant death by which the species must have been totally extirpated that god appointed this state of things it was a gracious mitigation of their doom it should be received by us as a favor and indulgence it was when our all seemed to be irretrievably lost that god appointed this state it is a subject of gratitude and joy rather than of regret and murmuring absolute destruction must have been the portion of mankind if god had not mercifully allowed them a new struggle against their seducer the allowance is greatly merciful by it god gives every individual a new trial and a trial with the unspeakable advantage of its being under the conduct of the great deliverer for immortal happiness and glory the seeming disorders of the world are but the means of our trial if we behave aright they shall contribute to our triumph great as they may be they shall not be perpetual evil shall be overthrown good shall prevail this is not our final state it shall be succeeded by an everlasting state in which virtue and felicity shall reign pure and unmixt    but let us ever remember that this happy state shall be obtained only by those who belong to the seed of the woman and that an opposite state of everlasting destruction awaits the serpent and all his seed all men belong either to the one or to the other this is the great distinction of mankind let us examine carefully to which class we belong are we yet engaged in the apostasy from god the devil is the head of that apostasy are we yet impenitent in sin sin is the work of the devil and they who do his work are his seed and shall be destroyed with him fly from this misery abandon sin without delay take christ jesus for your leader embrace him as your savior practice his religion then shall you belong to the promised seed then shall you be engaged in the cause of god and then shall you be happy you shall share with your redeemer in his triumph you shall live with him and reign with him for ever  sermon vi the promise of the redeemer to abraham genesis xxii    and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed though jesus christ appeared in the flesh only in the latter times yet his appearance for the redemption of fallen mankind was the gracious purpose of god before the world began a tim i    and from the very moment of the fall it was the principal object of divine providence with regard to mankind the design to which all the dispensations of his providence were subordinate ever since that period this great scheme of divine love has been steadily kept in the eye of god to unfold it gradually a series of prophesies was extended from the fall through all succeeding ages till the time of malachi the latest of the prophets  to compare the character the office and the actions of jesus christ as represented in the history of the new testament with the prophecies concerning him in the old must be an employment highly agreeable to every inquisitive person who has a just sense of the importance of the gospel dispensation it is likewise of great utility the clearness and fullness of the history removes the obscurity of the prophecies and the authority of the prophecies confirms our faith in the history  the prophecies concerning the messiah form a connected series in the occasions and circumstances of delivering them or in the manner of expressing them they have such a reference to one another as shows that they are intended of the same person every posterior prophecy bears a relation to those which preceded in some particulars it alludes to them it presupposes them and must be explained by them and in other particulars it gives a new opening into the subject it renders clear and determinate what in former predictions was obscure and indefinite or it discovers something concerning the redemption of the world or the character of the redeemer of which no intimation had been given before the truth of these observations will appear in explaining the prophecy which the text contains and for understanding that prophecy it will be useful to keep these observations in mind  it is a remarkable prophecy of the savior of the world the promise which god made to abraham in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed in this discourse i shall explain this prophecy and show that it was accomplished in jesus of nazareth  it gives intimation of three things  first that the redeemer of the world should be the seed of abraham  secondly that his undertaking should be highly beneficial to men and render them blessed  thirdly that the blessings resulting from his undertaking should not be confined to one nation but extended to all the nations of the earth  first in this prophecy god foretells that the redeemer of the world should be the seed of abraham  immediately after the fall god promised the redeemer under the title of the seed of the woman genesis iii     here he calls him the seed of abraham the similitude of expression was intended to show that both predictions relate to the same person that the author of blessedness now promised to abraham is the same with the head of mans recovery announced to our first parents in the first promise the expression the seed of the woman intimates the singular manner in which the redeemer should be conceived and born the expression here used gives no such intimation it leaves this character of the redeemer on the same footing on which that promise had put it but in the case of abraham there was something peculiar isaac from whom the redeemer was to spring was born miraculously of sarah after she was in the ordinary course of nature incapable of having a child this circumstance bore some analogy to the manner of expression in that promise it was sufficient to keep alive the expectation of an extraordinary birth  but the principal information intended to be given by calling the redeemer the seed of abraham was information of the family from which he should spring information that he should be a descendant of abraham  the expression used in the first promise the seed of the woman intimated that he should be a savior in human nature no more particular description of him was either necessary or proper at that time when only the common parents of the human race had yet a being but in course of time mankind were multiplied into many families in which of thse might they look for their redeemer for their direction in this point more particular revelations became necessary after the flood each of the three sons of noah was to be the progenitor of many nations in foretelling the state of their posterity by inspiration noah says god shall enlarge japheth and or but he shall dwell in the tents of shem genesis ix     by many the latter clause is referred not to japheth but to god and is understood as an intimation that the promised redeemer should be of the posterity of shem an intimation which in the form of expression bears a great analogy to the evangelists description of that redeemer the word was made flesh and dwelt the original imports tabernacled or pitched his tent among us john i      but shem had many sons and from each of them descended many nations it soon became necessary to point out from which of these the savior should spring for this purpose god called abraham from his own country into the land of canaan he promised this land as a temporal inheritance to his posterity and at the same time informed him that the redeemer should spring from him in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed genesis xii    abraham understood not this to mean that himself was the appointed savior but only that this savior should be one of his posterity accordingly it is recorded to his honor that while he had yet no child he believed god chap xv   romans iv      when isaac was promised intimation was also given that he was the son of abraham with whom god would establish his covenant genesis gal xvii        after his birth the intimation was repeated in isaac shall thy seed be called chap xxi     and when abraham had approved his faith by obeying gods command to offer isaac the grand promise was explicitly renewed and ratified by the oath of god in the words of my text in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed  these predictions not only determine the redeemer to be one from among the posterity of abraham but also intimate that he should be of his posterity by isaac and to isaac himself the promise was afterward repeated in the very same words which are employed in the text chap xxvi    abraham not only had before now ishmael by hagar but also was afterward to have several children by keturah but mankind are directed to look for their redeemer only among the posterity of isaac to render the direction still more determinate after isaac had two sons from whom distinct nations were to spring god said to jacob the younger of them in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of earth be blessed chap xxviii    as in the pursuance of the same intention jacob was made in his dying words to restrict the origin of the redeemer to the tribe of judah and the spirit of revelation in after times still farther restricted it to the family of david and likewise unfolded by degrees many particulars relating to the place and other circumstances of his birth  to ascertain and limit in this manner the expectation of the redeemer from time to time was every way worthy of the divine wisdom  it was necessary for preserving the expectation of this great person in the world in the family of abraham alone the expectation was preserved the rest of mankind degenerating basely from true religion very soon forgot the the primeval revelation and lost all expectation of the savior in the other branches even of the family of abraham and of isaac the promise made to them was quickly forgotten it was remembered only in the line of jacob from which it had been intimated that he was to spring and to which predictions of him were frequently repeated  the determination of the redeemers origin was also of great importance both for setting aside the pretensions of impostors and for giving evidence to the true redeemer when he should arise in vain would any person of other nations have claimed this character the redeemer must be of the posterity of abraham by isaac and by jacob by this single mark mahomet is convicted as a cheat but in jesus whom we embrace as our redeemer this is accomplished to these patriarchs the evangelists trace up his genealogy by both his parents and to the promise and oath made to abraham the new testament frequently refers in course of time multitudes of circumstances relating to him were foretold and as the predictions of him became more complex in the very same proportion the application of them became the simpler and the more infallible they were rendered so circumstantial before prophecy ceased that they could not possibly all agree to any person except him who was intended in them but various minute and circumstantial as they were they all agreed with the most punctual exactness to jesus of nazareth and thus demonstrated that he was the great deliverer promised from the beginning of the world and through all successive ages invariably kept in the eye of providence and gradually revealed to men  secondly it is foretold in the text that the undertaking of the person here promised should be highly beneficial to mankind  in him god says that men shall be blessed the original may mean shall bless themselves in this sense the jews understand it and explain the import of the promise to be that they who wanted to express the best wishes to another would pray may it be to thee as to abraham to confirm this sense of the expression it is observed that isaac in blessing jacob says god almighty give thee the blessing of abraham to thee and to thy seed with thee genesis xxviii      and that jacob having said to the sons of joseph in thee shall israel bless explains it to this very sense by adding saying god make thee as ephraim and as manasseh genesis xlviii  0  but in this latter passage the manner of expression is not precisely the same as in the text and the form of benediction recorded in the former passage rather took its occasion from the promise made to abraham than expressed the full sense of it it presupposes that blessings were promised to him and its import depends on what these blessings were the text is a part of that promise and its simplest meaning is that by the redeemer who was to spring from abraham the nations should be rendered happy  the expression is general it determines not the kind or degree of happiness which the redeemer would confer upon mankind yet abraham could not be at a loss to discern this the promise made to our first parents was in this respect more explicit the effect of the redeemers enterprise was expressed more definitely it was intimated that he would bruise the serpents head and this from the circumstances in which that promise was given could not but be understood by them to imply that he would obtain a complete victory over the devil defeat his designs against mankind recover them from the sin and guilt into which he had seduced them and restore them to that life and happiness from which they had fallen by his suggestion and in this sense they would explain it to their posterity abraham was acquainted with this first promise he could not but recollect it on this occasion and by its more precise terms he would define and limit the general expression of blessedness used in the new promise made to himself he would understand not merely that from this promised seed the nations should receive great benefits but also that he should be the author of all those particular benefits which are implied in bruising the serpents head it would readily be understood in the same sense in after ages by posterior predictions the nature of these benefits was more distinctly unfolded but it is in the new testament in the history of the great deliverer now actually come that we may learn the full import of the blessedness promised through him and with a plain and designed reference to this very promise the benefits derived to us from jesus christ are often mentioned in the new testament  of him before he was born zacharias prophesied when he was filled with the holy ghost as the great person of whom god spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets which have been since the world began and particularly as the person appointed to perform the mercy promised to our fathers and to remember his holy covenant the oath which he swear to our father abraham and in his prophecy described the blessings to be conferred by him as consisting in our being saved from our enemies and from the hand of all that hate us in his granting unto us that we being delivered out of the hands of our enemies might serve him without fear in holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our lives in his giving knowledge of salvation to his people by the rmission of the sins through the tender mercy of our god whereby the dayspring from on high has visited us to give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death to guide our feet into the way of peace luke i  0      the apostle peter having reminded the jews that they were the children of the prophets and of the covenant which god made with our fathers saying unto abraham and in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed thus describes the fulfillment of the promise in manifest allusion to the terms of it unto you first god having raised up his son jesus sent him to bless you in turning away every one of you from his iniquities acts iii        the apostle paul calls the christian salvation the blessing of abraham and under this name describes it as including christs redeeming us from the curse of the law and our receiving the promise of the spirit through faith the adoption of sons and the inheritance gal iii          iv    to abraham god promised that in his d the nations should be blessed and the apostle testifies that in christ god has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places ephesians i     the promise gave room to expect blessings great and manifold but all the blessings which men could beforehand conceive to be included in it or even in the more particular prophecies that followed the apostle justly observes are far exceeded by the blessings which the gospl assures us are actually purchased for us by jesus christ eye says he hth not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god has prepared for them that love him but god has revealed them to us by his spirit   cor ii    0  all the means of necessary knowledge and of holiness divine illumination strength and assistance the forgiveness of sins the favor of god the resurrection from the dead and the everlasting happiness of heaven these are the blessings which christ confers and they are blessings the greatest in themselves and the most suitable to ignorant weak corrupt guilty and mortal creatures of him who confers them it might be foretold with the greatest reason that in him men should be blessed  in the first promise it had been intimated that in conquering satan the redeemer should be a sufferer it had been said thou shall bruise his heel in the text it is only said that in him that is by means of him the blessing should come but in what particular way he should procure it the words give no intimation they were connected however with a very remarkable event god had commanded abraham take now thy son thine only son isaac whom thou love and get thee into the land of moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering genesis xxii    abraham had set out and on the third day of his journey was just preparing to obey the hard command when the angel of the lord stopped his uplifted hand preserved his son and provided another sacrifice in approbation and reward of this instance of faith and obedience the promise in the text was given and confirmed by an oath it is commonly allowed that that whole transaction was intended to give abraham information of the death and sacrifice of the redeemer and was understood by him to typify and prefigure these there is reason for allowing it but whether in that transaction abraham perceived the sacrifice of christ or not whether they who lived before christs appearance apprehended its meaning so far as to learn from it that he was to die a sacrifice or not yet we who live after the event can by its light perceive and do know that the whole transaction was a type of the sufferings and sacrifice of christ to us it is a proof that this method of redemption was foreseen and foreordained by god between abraham at gods command offering isaac the son whom he loved in sacrifice and god giving his only begotten and wellbeloved son to be a sacrifice for our sins between gods requiring isaac the very heir of the promise the first born of the covenant to be offered and his requiring jesus christ the great subject of that promise the head of the covenant to be made a propitiation for the sins of the world the similitude and correspondence is so perfect as to leave no room for our doubting that the one was intended to be prophetical of the other the conformity between the types under the old testament and the events of the new happened not by chance but was purposely contrived to show us christians that the grand design of mans redemption which we see now accomplished was ever in the view of god was always carrying on and ran through all the dispensations of revealed religion abraham withheld not isaac his son his only son and god spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all romans viii     the sufferings to which he delivered him up and by which he made the atonement chap v     were clearly foretold in the course of the prophecies and in the new testament we have the history of the sufferings which jesus underwent and descriptions of the efficacy of his sacrifice exactly agreeable to the prophecies  thirdly it is foretold in the text that the blessings in this manner purchased by the redeemer should extend to all nations  in the first promise this was not expressed it was not necessary the first parents of the whole human race were alike connected with all the kindreds of their posterity but now when one nation was pointed out from which the redeemer was to spring there was great need to give intimation that he was not intended for the benefit of that nation only but of all nations this was the more necessary because along with the promise given to to abraham isaac and jacob that the redeemer was to spring from them there was constantly a promise also given them of a temporal inheritance of the land of canaan genesis xii     xv        xvii   xxii    xxvi     xxviii           which was peculiar to their posterity and in which other nations had no interest this might have led them to interpret the promise of the savior as likewise peculiar to themselves their establishment in the land of canaan was made subservient to the great design of the redemption of the world by preserving among them the knowledge of the one true god and by giving scope to a long series of prophecies concerning that dispensation of his grace finding themselves in this manner selected by god and privileged above other nations they would the more readily conclude that the redeemer was designed for them alone for preventing the mistake this early intimation that he was to be the savior of all nations was highly proper by many succeeding prophecies the same information was inculcated upon them all this did not prevent their falling into the mistake but it rendered it inexcusable  before the savior came they had persuaded themselves in opposition to the information of all the prophets that he was to be the temporal deliverer only of their nation had jesus christ been an impostor he would have accommodated his pretensions to their conceptions indeed he must have been under the same prejudice it could never have entered into his thoughts to form a design totally repugnant to the notions which so universally and so deeply possessed all his countrymen he showed himself to be no impostor he showed himself to be the promised redeemer by the very pretensions which he made to the contracted notions of the jews they were diametrically opposite but they agreed exactly to the declarations of the prophets and fulfilled them he appeared not as the deliverer of the jews but as the savior of the world the angels proclaimed his birth to be good tidings of great joy which should be unto all people luke ii  0  in his lifetime he gave many intimations that he was intended for all nations and after his resurrection he expressly commanded his disciples to go into all the world teach all nations and preach the gospel to every creature mark xvi    matt xxviii     they did so their own minds were purified from the prejudices of their nation they saw that the gentiles as well as the jews had access to salvation and blessedness by faith in jesus christ they perceived of a truth that god is no respecter of persons but in every nation he that fears him and works righteousness is accepted with him acts x        they proclaimed that there is no difference between the jew and the greek for the same lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him romans x    the narrowminded jews found fault but the apostles withstood them confuted them from the prophets and oftener than once confuted them from this very promise made to abraham which they informed them was not to abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith chap iv     know ye therefore says paul that they which are of faith the same are the children of abraham and the scripture foreseing that god would justify the heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto abraham saying in thee shall all nations be blessed so then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful abraham gal iii        the blessing of abraham has come on the gentiles through jesus christ ver     the covnant which was confirmed before of god in christ the law which was four hundred and thirty years after cannot disannul that it should make the promise of none effect ver     if ye be christs then are ye abrahams seed and heirs according to the promise ver      it was observed before that the text may be rendered in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth bless themselves but rendered in this manner it implies a far more important sense than that which the jews would give it it foretells that the nations should acknowledge that in this seed alone they can be happy it foretells the actual reception of the redeemer by all nations this also is verified in jesus christ in him the nations blessed themselves much more than the jews who claimed the messiah as altogether their own only a few of the jews in comparison believed on him while the bulk of them rejected him multitudes of the gentiles received his gospel while the jews the natural and immediate heirs of promise the descendants of his own ancestors are outcasts from his kingdom it is established in many nations in all the quarters of the world already the prophecy is so far accomplished as to give us ground of assurance that in due time it will have its full completion by all the kingdoms of this world becoming the kingdoms of our lord and of his christ rev xi     this day is this prophecy brethren fulfilled in ourselves we are by nature gentiles aliens from the commonwealth of israel and strangers from the covenants of promise but now in christ jesus we who sometime were asar off are brought nigh and are made fellowcitizens with the saints and of the household of god fellowheirs and partakers of his promise in christ by the gospel ephesians iii          iii    this very day we sit here assembled acknowledging the redeemer as already come preached unto the gentiles believed on in the world tim iii     and if our acknowledgment be sincere if we heartily accept the redemption which he has wrought and comply with the religion which he has taught us in him we shall be blessed for evermore being set down with abraham and isaac and jacob in the kingdom of heaven matt viii      thus my brethren i have shown you the meaning of this prophesy and its accomplishment and now what are we to learn from the whole    shall we not be inexcusable if we receive not the savior who is so carefully pointed out to us every prophesy in the old testament accomplished under the new is a proof of the divinity of both it shows that they have the same author and that he is the god who is perfect in knowledge in whose eyes the future is even as the present in jesus this very early prophecy was exactly fulfilled abraham had no child when this promise wa first made to him nor was there in the ordinary course of nature a possibility of his having one yet he believed god against hope he believed in hope and being not weak in aith he considered not his own body now dead neither the deadness of sarahs womb he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform romans iv           0     he believed in circumstances if possible still more difficult when he was tried he offered up isaac and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son of whom it was said that in isaac shall thy seed by called accounting that god was able to raise him up even from the dead from whence also he received him in a figure hb xi          when we are commanded to believe in jesus christ how much less is required of us than abraham performed to us the redeemer is not promised but shown already come to us he is not darkly intimated but clearly manifested he was precisely marked by the prophets of all ages he was pointed out by the finger of the baptist he approved himself the true savior by fulfilling in himself all that had been before written concerning him god also bearing him witness both with signs and wonders and with diverse miracles heb ii     of evidence leaves no excuse for unbelief be not ye brethren faithless but believing john xx     walking in the steps of the faith of our father abraham romans iv        how great is our danger if we reject a savior whose undertaking is so important in the eye of god the salvation of mankind by jesus christ is so important that it has been the object of gods attention complacence and delight through all the ages of the world all his revelations to mankind the separation of the israelites and the whole plan of their religion point to this as their great end the information of it which the text contains was given to abraham as a suitable reward for the highest instance of his obedience all this sets its importance in the strongest light it represents it as what our savior calls it the counsel of god the final result of the deliberations of perfect wisdom the jews rejected this counsel of god against themselves luke vii  0  it was a most atrocious crime it was to baffle all the contrivances of divine wisdom and love for their good the restoration of mankind from ignorance corruption guilt death and misery to knowledge purity favor immortality and happiness is the object of the redeemers undertaking it must be the ultimate end of all the dispensations of providence relative to mankind it is the grandest design in which they can be interested how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation heb ii    of what punishment shall we not justly be thought worthy knowing the terrors of the lord   cor v     let us be persuaded to seek the favor of god through jesus christ in whom he is wellpleased mat iii        with what gratitude and joy should we embrace the savior who is revealed to us accept the salvation which he has purchased and perform the terms on which he offers it abraham laughed genesis xvii     when isaac was promised to him he rejoiced says our savior to see my day and he saw it and was glad john viii     how much more should we be glad abraham saw the day of christ but faintly and at a distance we see it already risen and sit under the full light of it the blessings of gods covenant were only hinted to him but to us they are fully displayed if he rejoiced because to him the promise was made ought not we much more to rejoice when to us the promise is performed we are not the children of abraham according to the flesh yet we are made by the kindness of god the children of the promise to us it has been said rejoice ye gentiles with his people deuteronomy xxxii    romans xv  0  among us are preached the unsearchable riches of christ ephesians iii    let us be thankful for this grace let us cheerfully improve it let us perform with alacrity whatever is necessary for our obtaining everlasting happiness through jesus christ  sermon vii constancy in religion enforced by the common sufferings of human life   cor x    there has no temptation taken you but such as is common to man from observing that in the present state calamities befall good and bad men indiscriminately the irreligious have concluded that god takes no concern about the behavior of men and that is is therefore vain to serve him mal iii     and from observing that a strict adherence to virtue is in some cases the direct cause of suffering or loss they have affected to conclude farther that it is even folly to be virtuous the great reward which god has promised to good men in the future life is doubtless sufficient to render it our highest wisdom to adhere to virtue whatever sufferings it may bring upon us in the present life but earthly things take so fast an hold of the minds of men that sufferings for religion must always have some tendency to prevent their looking forward to the heavenly reward with faith firm enough to sustain their fortitude and secure their stedsastness on this account the scripture often calls such sufferings by way of eminence temptations  it is in the time of persecution chiefly that men are exposed to temptations of this kind but they are not totally exempt from them at any time there will always be particular situations in which religion obstructs mens worldly interest in which we may forfeit some immediate advantage or incur something troublesome or disagreeable by inflexible and uncomplying virtue and there will be many more situations in which we may be apprehensive of these consequences though we be under no temptation to renounce our religion altogether we may be very strongly tempted to what is inconsistent with some of its particular laws dread of incurring the ridicule of the world the displeasure of friends the resentment of the powerful the loss of a favorable opportunity for gain are often pleaded by men in every age as excuses for acknowledged deviations from the strict line of integrity and innocence never therefore can it be unseasonable to exhort christians to constancy in virtuous practice notwithstanding the sufferings losses and inconveniences in which it may involve them or to urge upon them for this purpose the same arguments which the sacred writers proposed for the confirmation of the first christians enduring persecution for the sake of the gospel  in this earthly state all men without exception are subjected to suffering and affliction far from considering this as unfavourable to the cause of virtue or religion the sacred writers deduce from this very topic an argument for resolution patience and constancy under the peculiar sufferings to which religion and virtue sometimes expose good men to support the christians of that age under persecution for righteousness sake they remind them that all mankind as well as they are obnoxious to many sufferings we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now romans vii   says the apostle in fortying the romans against the sufferings of this present time      the corinthians also were in danger of suffering for religion they dreaded that their refusing all communion with the pagans in their idolatrous feasts might provoke their resentment and raise a persecution perhaps they had experienced this in some degree the gospel notwithstanding required them to persist in their refusal compliance with any appendage of pagan worship would have been an apostasy from the faith of christ and from the service of the one living god the apostle exhorts them to inflexible resolution let him that thinks he stands take heed lest he fall and enforces the exhortation by this argument there has no temptation taken you but such as is common to man the sufferings which you have incurred by your stedfastness and all the sufferings which by it you can incur are only such as are ordinary in the life of man therefore you ought to meet them with fortitude to bear them with patience and not allow yourselves to be moved by them to deviate from the purity of the gospel in a point so essential the force of the argument cannot but be felt as soon as it is proposed yet its impression may be strengthened by its being deliberately unfolded by our considering attentively in what particular ways the common troubles of human life urge us to submit cheerfully to those troubles which the good man may sometimes incur by doing his duty they urge us to this conduct by the example of suffering which they exhibit  by leading us to conclude that if we had not been exposed to sufferings for virtue other afctions would have been allotted to us  by convincing us that by deviating from virtue we can obtain no security against falling into the like sufferings  and by stamping vanity upon all present outward things  first the afflictions and sorrows which are common and even universal in human life excite us to constancy under sufferings for religion and a good conscience by the very example of suffering which they exhibit think not for a single moment of deserting religion of transgrsng any one of its laws on account of the inconveis to which it may expose you for these inconveniences whatever they be are only such as men in this mortal state very commonly endure  if the generality passed through life without seeing any evil days you might have some excuse for thinking it hard that you alone should be subjected to affliction especially that you should be subjected to it by a strict adherence to your duty but every one that is born of a woman is of few days and ull of trouble job xiv    on every man sorrows are multiplied by one cause or another you cannot expect an exemption from the necessary condition of your species when you too find trouble and sorrow psalm cxvi    why should you repine its being occasioned by your stedfastness in your duty renders your condition no worse than that of many who have fallen into as great trouble by other means if the fulfilling of the obligations of religion exposes you to suffering you ought not to venture on transgressing them in order to avoid it till you have first surveyed all the miseries of those who suffer but not for religion till you have traced the disasters of all ages down from adam to the present hour and till you be able to say that what you must endure in retaining your integrity job ii    is bitterer than ever fell to the lot of man but truly religion never exposed its most determined champions even in the bloodiest persecutions to greater losses or severer pains than many have been forced to encounter in the common course of providence or have brought upon themselves by their imprudence or their crimes religion has exposed men to the spoiling of their goods heb x     to suffer the loss of all things for christ jesus phil iii    suppose it should require you in adhering to virtue to relinquish all your possessions yet would it reduce you to a worse condition than that man whom you see contentedly earning a scanty livelihood by his daily labor or than that other whom you find always cheerful though he be begging his bread look to them and be ashamed to commit the smallest sin through dread of poverty religion has exposed men to bonds and imprisonment heb xi    they are grievous but have not many suffered them and suffered them with patience for other causes than firmness in religion religion has exposed men to death but is death an uncommon event is it not strictly universal and inevitable do you not see men dying around you every day if god brings you into such circumstances that you must either desert your duty or lay down your life can you hesitate in fixing your choice there are a thousand other ways in which you may lose your life in some way you must lose it soon but in no other way can it be so honorable so glorious to lose it if it be in the very prime of your days that you are called to sacrifice your life to the fulfillment of your duty yet still you shall be but one of many hundreds who are cut off in the prime of their days and when it is certain that you must die once can it e of very great importance whether you die today or tomorrow or not many days hence the dread of death strong as it naturally is in men cannot always prevent their exposing themselves to the danger of it in the prosecution of their worldly interests nay in the very train of their amusements shall we notwithstanding allow it to prevent our exposing ourselves to that danger in securing our eternal interests by constancy in avoiding evil and doing good the dread of a violent death has not always power enough to restrain the wicked from the crimes against which it is denounced and shall it be able to pervert us from our virtue shall they encounter tribulations in the way of destruction which we refuse to meet in the way of salvation froward and strange is the way of man prove xxi    he is wise and bold to do evil but to do good he has no knowledge jer iv     no resolution the fury of wicked men has sometimes prepared cruel tortues for the martyrs of god but tortures as cruel have often been inflicted on the atrocious criminal the detested rival or even the unhappy captive and the pains of natural death in some of its forms are both greater and more lasting than any artificial torments what sufferings can execuse your being deterred from your duty or frightened into sin the greatest that you can incur are only such as multitudes have sustained when religion was not at all concerned  but all the inconveniences which men ordinarily meet with in adhering to their duty are far less than many of the most common evils of life they are among the very slightest distresses incident to man they are such as thousands and ten thousands suffer day after day almost without a murmur the sneer of the ungodly the scoff of the profane the frown of the unprincipled or the misjudging the forfeiture of a small immediate profit the loss of an opportunity of becoming a little richer or a little greater the sacrifice of a trifling proportion of what we have the pain of denying ourselves some sensual pleasure which a brute might relish as much as we these are the troubles for exposing us to which we often complain of religion and of virtue as enemies to our present interest and enjoyment and for avoiding which we too often venture to do what our hearts condemn what are these amidst the multitudes of calamities under which human creatures groan how many endure them and endure them willingly for purposes infinitely lss considerable than the preservation of a good conscience for the sake of these to entertain a thought of venturing on the least deviation from virtue would demonstrate a want of all regard to it would betray less spirit than the meanest of mankind exert almost every day these are hardships very common to man they are so very common and so very trivial that they scarcely deserve to be called temptations they are acknowledged by all when religion is not in the question to be extremely slight  in a word religion can never expose men to greater sufferings it generally exposes men to much more tolerable sufferings than such as are common to man whatever you may suffer by patient continuance in welldoing romans ii    you cannot be singular in your suffering the present state is so much a state of sorrow and affliction to all that to have the spirit of martyrdom for religion is little more than to have the spirit of a man the resolution necessary for bearing the ordinary vicissitudes and troubles of human life we act not the part of men if we show any anxiety to shun whatever distresses cannot be shunned except by our forfeiting our innocence  secondly because sorrows and sufferings are universal in this life and every individual of the human species has a share of them we reasonably conclude that if we were exempt from those which at any time we incur by doing our duty other afflictions would have been allotted to us perhaps equally perhaps more severe let no man therefore be moved by these afflictions   thessalonians iii    accept them as your lot without repining endure them without being shaken in mind   thessalonians ii    or falling from your own stedfastness   pet iii      man is born unto trouble job v    it is the appointed inheritance of his nature for any man to elude the appointment is as impossible as to reverse the established law of matter by which the sparks fly upward job v    the god who made us has measured out to every man his portion of affliction if it shall fall to your lot to suffer affliction for the sake of virtue be assured that without this or some other equivalent affliction your measure could not have been full whatever loss you incur whatever hardship you undergo by persevering in what is right it is only in the place of some other loss or hardship which else you must have incurred by different means by encountering it you render your condition no more than it would have been at any rate perhaps you reckon it an aggravation of your trouble that it is occasioned by your virtue when the excellence of virtue should secure its leading us to quietness peace joy honor and good report is there not a peculiar hardship in being for the very sake of it plunged into the contrary evils can we but be disappointed can we but regret that the natural consequences of actions should be so much perverted the regret is only the suggestion of a heart prone to repining and cold in its attachment to virtue the disappointment is only the failure of a groundless expectation we are forewarned that all that will live godly in christ jesus shall sometimes suffer persecution   timothy iii     the hardship is only in imagination sufferings occasioned by your doing your duty cannot be more galling than the same or equal sufferings proceeding from other causes they are on many accounts lighter and more eligible  the god of mercy does not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men lam iii     he mingles their cup with sorrow only because it is necessary for their discipline and improvement in this state of probation he chasteneth us only for our profit that we might be partakers of his holiness heb xii  0  and he never chasteneth any who serve him with sincerity farther than is needful for answering this end now afflictions incurred by constancy in virtue promote our improvement more directly and more powerfully than those which are incurred by any other means the latter though we bear them in the best manner curb only some of our carnal or worldly lusts improve only some particular virtuous principles the principles of resignation submission patience and trust in god but the former improve all the virtuous principles at once add strength to the whole temper of goodness and confirm us in universal holiness by their natural operation they yield the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby ver     they are the very trial of our faith much more precious than of gold that perishes though it be tried with fire   pet i    to have answered the same good purposes to our souls to have raised us to an equal degree of improvement sufferings from other causes must have been severer no affliction therefore which you can undergo in the cause of virtue can be the subjeect of just complaint it is the subject of gratitude and joy it saves you from a heavier affliction without the one or the other some trial necessary for your sanctification had been wanting and the want of it might have proved the ruin of your souls  at the same time afflictions incurred by steadfast adherence to virtue are more honorable than any others they are relieved by more powerful supports and sweeter consolations and they will be followed by a greater reward  in bearing afflictions absolutely and by every means inevitable there is little praise but to choose rather to suffer affliction with the people of god heb xi     than to purchase immunity from it by any vicious compliance or blameable neglect is the highest praise to suffer for evildoing is ignominious resolution in enduring it is often only hardiness and effrontery in sin at the best it cannot atone for the ignominy of the crime what glory is it if when ye be buffeted for your faults ye take it patiently   pet ii  0  but this is glory if a man for conscience toward god endure grief suffering wrong fully ver     poverty incurred by the strictness of integrity has nothing abject reproach provoked by a determined steadiness or an unfashionable delicacy of virtue is true renown bonds and imprisonments inflicted for unbending perseverance in what is right are genuine liberty death itself for the sake of god and of christ is a crown of life let none of you suffer as a murderer or as a thief or as an evildoer yet if any man suffer as a christian let him not be ashamed but let him glorify god on this behalf chap iv        if you be called to suffer shame or loss or inconvenience for the name of jesus rejoice that ye are counted worthy acts v      the wicked may be forced to suffer what it is beyond their strength to bear their sufferings are imbittered by the cutting sense of guilt their sufferings are sent by god in his anger for their punishment and who knows the power

falsely for my sake instead of shrinking rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven mat v         in short suffering is the lot of all men if you had escaped the sufferings which you may at times endure for religion you might have expected other sufferings in their room to have contributed as much to your improvement these must have been greater but you would have had weaker supports slenderer consolations and a less reward grudge not therefore but rejoice if sufferings for welldoing shall fall to your share instead of common afflictions encounter them with alacrity refuse to deviate from your duty in any point though by the smallest deviation you could be certain to avoid them  but this is not the case for thirdly the universality of sufferings and afflictions in  present state is sufficient to convince us that if we be prevailed upon to deviate from virtue by the sufferings to which it may sometimes expose us yet we cannot by the deviation escape affliction or obtain security against falling into the like sufferings by other means the question is not whether you shall desert your duty and be exempt from trouble or adhere to your duty and incur trouble this is the gross misrepresentation of your own delusive fancy no such choice can be permitted you the question is whether you shall hold fast your righteousness job xxvii    and patiently endure whatever trouble it may occasion or let go your righteousness and yet be forced to endure trouble in this state of the question can your election be attended with any difficulty but this is the real state who ever passed through life without meeting a time of trouble what age what station what profession what character what conduct could ever prove a security against it it is the sad birthright of fallen man how should you alone hope to escape it and to escape it too by declining from your duty by renouncing your virtue  that god whose appointment the lot of human creatures is has in his wisdom ordained that the same distresses should be brought on different men by different causes some are born to indigence some are reduced to it by unavoidable calamities some purchase it by folly or their vices some incur it by the stedfastness of their virtue one is brought prematurely to the grave by the pining decay of a weakly constitution another by the violence of an acute distemper one is cut off in his full strength by some ftal accident another falls a victim to the poison of his vices or the demeit of his crimes and another encounters death in the midst of his days for the sake of god and a good conscience there is sarcely a circumstance in the state of man which may not prove the source of almost any of the pains and distresses to which he is obnoxious what trouble can religion bring upon you that may not likewise proceed from many other causes when through dread of it you have violated your virtue and wounded your souls with guilt how soon may some of these other causes plunge you into that very trouble suppose it were one of the most grievous troubles incident to man nevertheless it is folly to commit any sin or forbear any duty in order to avoid it unless you could promise to defeat all the other causes which may afterward produce it the very hour after you have made shipwreck of faith and a good conscience   timothy      the irresistible stroke of divine providence or that very act of vice by which you hoped to avert it may hurl it down upon your heads in all its fury you have an opportunity for instance of preserving your possessions or of increasing them by dishonesty or falsehood or sin you seize the opportunity but the thief the oppressor the fire the elements any one of a thousand common misfortunes perhaps the very detection of your baseness may very soon rob you of all that you expected to secure pluck the wages of unrighteousness   pet ii    out of your hands and leave you nothing but the pollution which you have contracted in grasping at them there is some person from whose favor you expect much or whose displeasure you reckon very detrimental to your interest you do something wrong to gratify him but in a few days from the mere mutability of caprice from a misconstruction which you have no means of preventing or correcting nay it may be despising you for the meanness of your compliance with his humor or his vices that person may withdraw his deceitful favor become your enemy and abandon you without pity to the agonizing reflection that you have sold your innocence for naught when judas stung with remorse came to the chief priests and elders saying i have sinned in that i have betrayed the innocent blood without any compassion for his anguish without so much as thanking him for having fulfilled their darling wish they answered him what is that to us see thou to that and he cast down the whole price of his perfidy and departed and went and hanged himself mat xxvi        instances of such disappointments of the apostates hopes might easily be multiplied they are numerous both in the history of the dead and in the experience of the living they are alarming warnings to every one of us that apostasy from our duty can be no refuge from the troubles which we fear in performing it  that apostasy from any point of duty will increase our trouble is much more likely than that it can bring us immunity from trouble the soldier who through fear of death flees from his post in battle is forced to submit with ignominy to the very death which he might have met with honor in the field if virtue itself which is beloved by the god who orders all events and is the object of his special favor and protection cannot secure men from tribulation in this land of sorrow is security to be expected from vice which is odious to him which forfeits his favor takes us out of his protection and provokes his wrath the whole tendency of virtue is naturally to peace and prosperity it is only by its imperfection in the human character and by the prevalence of vice counteracting its operation that ever it becomes the occasion of pain or suffering but sin is the natural parent of pain and suffering it alone brought them into the world it alone perpetuates them in the world evil pursues sinners prove xiii     their portion is grief upon grief and distress upon distress till death carry them into the place where there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth matt xiii     they who through fear of suffering or loss desert from the service of god to the service of sin can scarcely fail to pierce themselves through with many sorrows   timothy vi  0  miserable are they if they escape heavy sorrows after having thus fallen away the strongest means are necessary for renewing them again unto repentance heb vi    they must be bound in fetters and be holden in cords of affliction in order to show them their work and their transgressions that they have exceeded and to open their ear to discipline that they may return from iniquity job xxxvi      0  it is a part of gods promise of the messiah if his children forsake my law then will i visit their transgression with the rod and their iniquity with stripes psalm lxxxix  0     to escape being visited by calamities equal at least to those which you evaded by your defection would show you to be given up by god unto your own hearts lust psalm lxxxxi     to be reprobated from the heritage of those that fear his name psalm lxi    to be of them who draw back unto perdition heb x     the greatest of the evils to which virtue can expose you it is certain that you cannot evade by any defection from it if you could effectually evade all other troubles yet from death the utmost that man can do no desertion of your duty can possibly redeem you it is appointed unto men once to die chap ix     there is no man that has power over the spirit to retain the spirit in the day of death there is no discharge in that war neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it eccl viii    death is the most formidable temptation of the kind and in great wisdom and great goodness god has provided that against yielding to it the argument is strongest death the apostate from integrity must notwithstanding meet though a sinner do evil an hundred times and his days be prolonged yet surely i know that his days are as a shadow and cannot be prolonged for ever ver         but if the very calamity for avoiding which you have cast away your virtue shall notwithstanding come upon you or if a greater calamity shall overwhelm you will you then find any comfort in reflecting that you once warded it off for a little by forsaking the ways of god and forfeiting his favor or when the hour is come and it will soon come in which death must remove you from this world will you be able to rejoice in the consciousness that a few days or months before you renounced your virtue rather than quit the world will you then be entitled to the same selfapprobation the same joy in the holy ghost the same bright hope of eternal life which would have supported and invigorated you if you had encountered it for the sake of righteousness will it not on the contrary be aggravated by remorse dejection and terror will it be possible in the day of trouble or of death to reflect without insupportable regret and anguish that you might have continued unblemished that you might have retained the worth of the saint that you might have purchased the glory of the martyr and yet have been in no worse situation than that to which you are now reduced after having lost your innocence your honor and your hope the greatest alleviation of which the sufferings incident to mortality are susceptible is their being occasioned by inflexibility in what is right in every respect it is better if the will of god be so that ye suffer for welldoing than for evildoing   pet iii     if ye obtain this lot if ye suffer for righteousness sake happy are ye and highly privileged above all your brethren in adversity be not afraid of their terror neither be troubled but sanctify the lord god in your hearts ver         thus because this world is full of troubles we cannot avoid them by forsaking the path of virtue there are many causes which may precipitate us into the same or greater troubles greater we shall need for our recovery and must undergo if we be not abandoned to final apostasy but undergo with far more grievous vexation of spirit the object of your deliberation in the hour of danger for conscience sake is not whether it be wiser to avoid troubles or to endure them it is simply which is preferable virtue or vice a good conscience sweetening calamities or an evil conscience embittering them a blessed hope taking away the sting of death or despair filling it with venom he is a fool who will forfeit heaven without so much as bettering his earthly state we are guilty of this folly if we commit any sin in order to avoid any temporal calamity or inconvenience if our heart be turned back from god or our steps decline from his way though he should even break us in the place of dragons and cover us with the shadow of death psalm xliv         fourthly the troubles and calamities which are common to man excite us resolutely to encounter such as we meet with in the performance of our duty by stamping vanity on all outward and temporal things  though health riches honors power or sensual pleasures were in their nature capable of yielding full enjoyment to man they could not yield it to him in the present state because it abounds with troubles any one of which will blast them and render them insipid whatever satisfaction mortal man may derive from them it cannot be pure it must be mixed with much alloy should wealth and dignitis in the greatest profusion drop into his bosom the stroke of disease will deprive them of all their power to gratify him all his days he eats in darkness and much sorrow eccl v     should his health be sound he may languish in poverty or pine with hunger all his efforts for prosperity may prove abortive he may attain prosperity and find it a torment to his soul and from the height of prosperity a moment may tumble him down into deep adversity seeing there be many things that increase vanity what is man the better all the days of his vain life which he spends as a shadow eccl vi        every external joy is incomplete for it is always impaired by some concomitant circumstance of uneasiness it is transitory and precarious for it is quickly obliterated by some succeeding sorrow it can last only till death and then it cease for ever every one of the manifold troubles of human life is a voice from god proclaiming to mankind that nothing earthly can be the happiness of man his happiness must be what is unassailable by calamity and unextinguishable by death it is only in religion therefore that he can find his happiness in every situation he can adhere to religion if he will and if he adhere to it nothing can deprive him of it we cannot obtain whatever we may wish for but we can dutifully welcome whatever god sends upon us we cannot ward off every trouble but we can take care not to multiply or aggravate our troubles by our own wickedness we cannot avoid death but we can prepare ourselves to die like christians we cannot prevent disagreeable and painful consequences arising from some of our actions but we can prevent our actions from being other than they ought to be by the divine assistance of which the gospel assures us virtue is always in our own power through the vanity of the world all things earthly and temporal are in the power of innumerable accidents to sacrifice our virtue for present ease or security to act viciously for fear of temporal loss or inconvenience to depart from our duty in order to avoid the trouble which in a particular instance it threatens to bring upon us were to exchange substantial happiness for an unsatisfying trifle a permanent possession for a precarious and transient phantom it were to prefer what will be quickly buried in the dust to what will enter into heaven and flourish through the ages of eternity it were in flying from a slight and momentary hurt to rush into everlasting destruction if by committing sin if by swerving from steady virtue you could be certain to extricate yourselves from the fear of suffering yet the choice would be disadvantageous pernicious and ruinous  in every light therefore it is a powerful argument for constancy in religion that it can expose us to no loss hardship or affliction but such as is common to man in all these ways the universality of sorrow and suffering in the present state may excite us to meet with fortitude and to bear with patience whatever we shall incu by a firm and conscientious adherence to our duty it can be only such as multitudes endure in the ordinary course of human life to shun it by throwing away your virtue would be an unmanly weakness it is allotted you in the place of some other affliction which to have been as effectual for your sanctification must have been severer you should rejoice in it instead of entertaining a thought of averting it by sin if you should sin you cannot expect to avert it for ever there are many causes which may still subject you to it and whenever they do it will be dreadfully embittered by the remembrance of your having once committed sin on purpose to elude it but though you could effectually avert trouble by forsaking virtue it were folly to forsake it it were to barter your true happiness for mere vanity wherefore let every man take heed lest he fall   cor x     for in standing fast no tribulation can come upon you but such as is common in the world if it be the will of god that you must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of god acts xiv     it is likewise through much tribulation that the wicked shall enter into the kingdom of satan which is the better part judge ye  many are the arguments which enforce constancy in holiness in spite of all the consequences that can possibly attend it the argument on which i have now insisted is alone sufficient to determine those who will consider if any thing seem necessary for adding to its force allow me only to remind you of what bears a close relation to it that the best men in all ages far from being exempt from troubles have endured many and grievous troubles and often endured them for conscience sake in suffering you are but partakers with all mankind in suffering for virtue and religion you shall be but partakers with all the saints as the whole creation groaneth under the vanity to which it is subjected so ourselves also says the apostle which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves romans viii  0        consider the days of old the years of ancient times psalm lxxvii    take my brethren the apostles take the prophets who have spoken in the name of the lord for an example of suffering affliction and of patience jam v  0  ye have heard of the patience of job ver     ye have heard of the innumerable company of martyrs they were tortured not accepting deliverance they had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sawn asunder they were slain with the sword they wandered about being destitute afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy heb xi         but none of these things moved them neither counted they their life dear unto themselves so that they might finish their course with joy acts xx     the worst that can befall you in adhering steadfastly to your duty will not exceed what far better men have suffered all that has befallen you comes infinitely short of it ye have not yet resisted unto blood striving against sin heb xii    no all that you can plead in excuse of your past inconstancy in virtue is loss so trivial inconvenience so slight uneasiness so insignificant that it deserves not to be named with the least of their sufferings it is shameful to complain of it it is disgraceful for the sake of it to have made one step awry from the ways of god should you be put to a much severer trial should you even be tried with the fiery trial think it not strange as though some strange thing happened unto you x pet iv     it has happened unto ten thousands of the saints let their sufferings and their intrepid perseverance banish your fears confirm your resolution and encourage your steadfastness it is through faith and patience that they now inherit the promises heb vi     be ye also patient and stablish your hearts jam v    be ye followers of them and ye shall obtain the same inheritance  you have even a greater example than that of the saints christ himself also suffered for us leaving us an example that ye should follow his steps   pet ii     though he was the son of god though he was perfectly holy his sufferings while he dwelt in this mortal state surpassed all that ever befell a son of man surpassed what any son of man could bear they were appointed by god for accomplishing the most stupendous purpose the redemption of the world but they were immediately occasioned by his inflexible adherence to truth and righteousness can you expect to meet with no hardship no inconvenience in pursuing the same conduct or will you grudge to meet it the disciple is not above his master nor the servant above his lord fear not therefore mat x         but rejoice in as much as ye are partakers of christs sufferings for if ye are partakers of the sufferings so shall ye be also of the consolation if the sufferings of christ even abound in us our consolation also shall abound by christ when his glory shall be revealed we shall be glad also with exceeding joy   pet iv      cor i      it is a faithful saying for if we be dead with him we shall also live with him if we suffer we shall also reign with him but if we deny him he also will deny us   timothy ii        i conclude with the apostles address wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds heb xii         now the god of all grace who has called us unto his eternal glory by christ jesus after that ye have suffered a while make you perfect stablish strengthen settle you to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever   pet v  0      amen sermon viii the old age of the righteous honorable prove xvi    the hoary head is a crown of glory if it be found in the way of righteousness this is a just aphorism and beautifully expressed old age is in a figurative and poetical manner described by one of its concomitants and by one which does not directly imply any of its infirmities but rather is in its very appearance venerable the hoary head the gray hairs as hairs are an ornament to the head the wise man by an elegant allusion to them calls old age a crown of glory encircling the head adorning it and challenging respect gray hairs indicate the decay of nature but they are notwithstanding an honorable crown if the man who wears them be found in the way of righteousness the plain meaning of the maxim is that the old age of good men is truly venerable and entitles them to esteem and honor  in the present discourse i shall briefly illustrate this maxim and then deduce some practical reflections from it  first i shall illustrate the maxim which solomon delivers in the text that good men who have been allowed a long life and have spent it in piety and virtue are honorable in their old age deserve and even command esteem  nature itself intimates that reverence is due to old age and has always both in the rudest and in the most civilized nations led men very generally to give it reverence when the young failed in respect to the old or treated them with contempt it has ever been considered as a certain mark of great degeneracy of manners the wise men of all countries have acknowleged that years give one kind of superiority and have inculcated reverence correspondent to it to enforce the subjection of the younger to the elder has been a part of the policy of all well regulated states and in some states this subjection has been carried very far and insisted upon in its utmost extent as indispensably necessary for the order and prosperity of society in the republic of israel god made it the subject of an express law thou shall rise up before the hoary head and honor the face of the old man and fear thy god i am the lord lev xix     elihu followed the dictates of nature and of decency when he waited till job and his three friends had spoken because they were elder than he job xxxii    and he spoke the language of both when he said i am young and ye are very old wherefore i was afraid and durst not show you mine opinion i said days should speak and multitude of years should teach wisdom ver       old age thus venerable on its own account cannot fail to become much more venerable when it is found in the way of righteousness the righteous is more excellent than his neighbor prove xii     true goodness in the greatest ornament of human nature it is the properest object of approbation and the justest foundation for esteem it entitles every person who possesses it to love and honor it must therefore be a great ornament to old age and render it truly respectable and venerable when the reverence due to a character of true goodness is added to the reverence due to old age very high veneration must be the result  but for the more particular illustration of solomons maxim for the fuller proof that the old age of the virtuous is honorable let us consider their old age  in relation to the life which has preceded it  in its own nature  and in respect of the prospects which it opens    the old age of the virtuous is honorable on account of the life which has preceded it it is the termination of a wise a wellspent and a useful life such a life was honorable and it reflects great glory on the person who has accomplished it  in a religious and virtuous old man we behold one who has long been exposed to the temptations of the world and has overcome them his virtues have been often put to the trial and they have stood the trial every period of human life has its peculiar difficulties the man who entered early on a religious and virtuous course and went forward in it uniformly to old age has surmounted all these difficulties in a long life there never fail to be vicissitudes of prosperity and adversity of joy and sorrow it is honorable through all these vicissitudes to have remained steadfast in the love and practice of goodness sincere goodness is always approved by god who knows the heart but goodness must be tried before its sincerity can be fully ascertained in the eyes of men we justly behold with pleasure the promising beginnings of goodness in the young but the most promising beginnings sometimes fail the bloom is blasted the fruit comes not to maturity on this account we can scarcely avoid mixing some degree of diffidence and reserve with our approbation of the virtues of the young but the virtuous old man has fully approved himself to men as well as to god by many proofs he has rendered it unquestionable that his goodness is true and genuine we may proclaim his virtues with perfect confidence like a veteran he has long encountered all the dangers of the christian warfare in many conflicts his resolution has been displayed his steadiness manifested and his inviolable attachment to god and goodness justified his integrity is proved by the multitude of his triumphs and they are triumphs full of the truest glory  by trials a mans virtue not only shows itself genuine but also becomes confirmed vigorous and eminent it is by exercise that every virtue is improved the same temptations which endanger our virtues by their assaults strengthen them when they are resisted a long life contains many trials and by every trial in which a man conquers he is made better if we devote ourselves to the practice of goodness in our earliest years and theneforth persist constantly in it we must make great progress before we reach old age a virtuous old person is a person of improved and exalted goodness all that honor and glory which belongs to goodness he claims in its highest degree  again a virtuous old age is the termination of a life which has been filled up with worthy and useful actions when a man as begun early to do good and lived to old ag doing good his services to god and to mankind must be numerous he has had many opportunities of virtuous practice if he has carefully improved them to what honor is he not entitled every day a good man lives he has greater glory than he had the day before for he has done greater good a long life of piety and virtue has contained a great multitude of good actions each of these actions sends forth a ray of glory which is rflected back upon him who did it and when all the scattered rays are collected and as it were twisted into a crown to encircle his hoary head how glorious is that crown with what luster must it shine how rich and how various an effulgence must it diffuse around him the sparkling of the diamond is dimness in comparison the veneration due to virtuous old age is the aggregate of all our approbations of the many virtuous and useful actions with which the prcedent life abounded and this veneration is heightened and sweetened by the emotions of love and gratitude for the advantages which mankind have derived from so long a sries of good offices    the old age of the virtuous is honorable in itself as well as in its relation to their past life  this appears in some measure from what has been already said the character which a pious and virtuous old person exhibits to our view is that of goodness genuine improved and useful of all characters the most respectable this character was acquired by the conduct of the whole life and therefore naturally turns our eye backward to its coure but when we consider it as already formed as now possessed in its maturity and actuating the aged person in all his motions it is in itself and without regard to the life which preceded it a glorious ornament in the earlier periods of life the tenor of a mans virtue is sometimes interrupted and its brightness tarnished by the impetuosity of the passions and the faults into which they precipitate him age calms the mind frees it from turbulent and unruly passions composes it into a holy serenity and makes all the virtues of the heart to shine forth like the sun in the clearest day unobscured by the clouds of vice  but not to enlarge on this in old age virtue is naturally accompanied by wisdom and prudence derived from long experience and by its union with these its luster is augmented much experience is the crown of old men and the fear of god is their glory ecclus xxv    experience is the most powerful teacher in youth men must be in a great measure destitute of its lights and in consequence of this in some cases they must be ignorant and in other cases they must misjudge it is when they are advanced in life that their knowledge becomes extensive their sentiments just and their maxims solid in early life the violence of the passions often hurries men on rashly to action without allowing them either leisure or inclination to listen to the voice of reason and the suggestions of prudence it is when years have rendered the passions less headstrong and the judgment more mature that reason is heard and wisdom acquired in all the savage nations the old men have from a fixed opinion of their wisdom the greatest weight in all public counsels the experience of age qualifies men for instructing for advising for directing when men are destitute of piety and virtue their experience is often only skillfulness in vice all their wisdom is but cunning and their maxims but the rules of deceit at the best their prudence is confined to the things of this world by communicating their sentiments to the younger if they do not corrupt them they will instruct them only in what regards their temporal interests and the conduct of civil life but when a man has grown old in goodness his maxims even for the present life are corrected and his prudence sanctified by religion and his prudence is not confined to earthly things his experience is great in religious matters likewise he has spiritual wisdom and is fit to lead others forward in the paths of righteousness he knows the various frailties of human nature for he has long experienced them and he can prescribe the properest remedies for removing or alleviating them he has had opportunity of observing the several wiles of satan and deceits of sin and is acquainted with the best defenses against them he has long studied the ways of god toward man he understands the language of the various dispensations of providence and he can teach others how to improve them he has learned the true value of things and found the vanity of the world and can check those gay idea and sanguine hopes of youth which when they are indulged without any check overwhelm men with bitter disappointment it is honorable for a man to be knowing in a useful business the virtuous old man has the honor of being knowing in that business which is the most important to every man we respect those who are able to direct and counsel us the aged saint is able to direct and counsel us in our chief concern the improvement of our immortal souls the respect which we owe him is proportioned to the moment of this object  in old age the strength necessarily decays the body becomes weak and feeble infirmities are multiplied it is only the most worthless or the most thoughtless that can on this account despise an aged person from all of other characters the infirmities of age will command the tenderest sympathy and this sympathy far from extinguishing respect will mix with it soften its feelings and make it to show its power by the most attentive care to avoid whatever could give uneasiness to the aged person and by the most assiduous endeavors to mitigate his distresses and promote his comfort when the infirmities of age are hastened or increased by a life of debauchery and vice they do render a person despicable but the bodies of good men are worn out in the practice of virtue in the service of god and mankind and the improvement of their own souls their infirmities themselves are therefore honorable they are like the wounds which the soldier has received in fighting bravely for his country and in which he glories they lead us only to regret the railty of nature which permits not the world longer to enjoy a deserving man when amidst the infirmities of age a person affects the levities or betrays a remaining attachment to the impurities of youth it is at once ridiculous and shocking all respect vanishes we can scarcely help giving full scope to indignation and contempt but his corruption not his decrepitude is the object of these sentiments the contrary sentiments are those which virtue inspies under the infirmitis of old age no wonder that the vicious sink but they give the virtuous an opportunity of showing the triumphs of religion and goodness in a new and striking light a person supporting these infirmities with patience amidst them all preserving composure serenity and cheerfulness  is he more venerable or more amiable he does honor to the power of religion and he is honored by his possessing religion in such power and exerting it with such splendor  the old age of good men is honorable in respect of the prospects which attend it these are the principal causes of that firmness and cheerfulness under their infirmities which we have just now seen procures them reverence and these reflect honor upon them in other ways  old age is the termination of this mortal life but to good men it is the immediate prelude to immortality a person who early began to follow holiness heb xii     and has persisted in it to an advanced age is ripe for the glory and happiness of heaven  it is of this man that eliphaz beautifully observes thou shall come to thy grave in a full age like as a shock of corn comes in in his season job v     like the corn of a fertile field he has grown up gradually pleasant in the sight of god and man and reached full maturity and now he is ready not to be cut down and cast into the fire like tares but to be gathered in removed beyond the reach of all the storms and tempests of this world and placed in everlasting security and peace  his hoary head is a natural emblem and the direct forerunner of that everlasting crown which he is ready to receive  now is his salvation near rom xiii   his prospects are instantly to take place and they are the most magnificent and glorious prospects and built upon the surest foundation they are ascertained by his past life and his present temper he has the pleasant consciousness of a wellspent life he has the comfortable sense of his being at peace with god through jesus christ chap v    he has the chearing view of being immediately delivered from every trouble and every sorrow he has the elevating hope of a great reward he knows that his dissolution approaches fast he perceives it without disquiet or regret he perceives it with joy he looks forward to the day of his death as the birthday of his eternal life when the apostle paul was now an old man and saw death ready to seize him even before the natural period and in one of its most formidable shapes he declared to timothy the transporting prospects which lay before him i am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand i have fought a good fight i have finished my course i have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge will give me at that day   timothy iv        every good man has a right to indulge the same prospects and not to me only continues the apostle but unto all them also that love his appearing can there be truer dignity than what is derived from such sentiments and views they ennoble the soul these are thy triumphs o religion thou enablest thy votaries to despise what others court to desire what others ead to rejoice in what overwhelms others with sorrow and dejection thou raisest them above mortality thou introducest them into everlasting happiness and glory the man who has grown old in goodness is truly great he can smile on death he can scorn the king of terrors he is just about to be advanced to a kingdom and invested with a crown he is quickly going to his god and his savior to be set down with them upon their throne can you conceive a more venerable object than a person just ready to enter into heaven with what respect with what awe with what admiration would you gaze on one of the inhabitants of heaven if he should revisit this earth and present himself to your view in a religious and virtuous old person you behold a man who after a few breaths and pulses more will be one of them who already stands in the very gate of heaven who is on the point of joining the innumerable company of angels the general assembly and church of the first born god the judge of all the spirits of just men made perfect and jesus the mediator of the new covenant this is real honor it is he who is thus honored by god that may be pronounced venerable  thus i have endeavored to illustrate solomons assertion that the old age of the righteous is honorable let us now attend to some of the practical reflections which naturally arise from the subject of our discourse  in general it gives us a striking view of the excellence of religion of the importance of true goodness fit to recommend it to our love and to engage us in the practice of it it doubles the honors of age it renders even its infirmities respectable it gives joy amidst all its distresses this is an illustrious display of the power of goodness a full proof that it is in its nature excellent and honorable let us all value and pursue it as the highest dignity and felicity of our souls it is the guide and the guard of youth the defense and the support of old age the ornament of all the periods of life it alone can preserve us innocent and blameless in our younger and gayer days render us useful in our maturity and give us comfort and heartsease when nothing else can give them in our decline it alone can regulate our temper and our conduct in the present life and it alone can prepare us for happiness in the next and by the chearing the celestial hope of unchangeable felicity beyond the grave reconcile us to all the vicissitudes of time  in particular the maxim which has been illustrated may be distinctly improved  by the young  and by the old  it instructs the young in the duty which they owe to their elders their years give them a superiority their experience gives them prudence and if they have exercised themselves unto godliness  tim iv    the length of their exercise has rendered them proficients in holiness these are all natural motives to respect esteem and honor the young sometimes allow themselves to despise the aged for the infirmities of their bodies and the decays of their activity and strength this shows always giddiness and inconsideration often it proceeds from depravity of heart and is attended with degeneracy of manners it is to disregard the order of nature which gives preeminence to age it is to find fault with age for wanting what the constitution of things cannot permit it to have the glory of young men is their strength but the beauty of old men is the gray head prove xx     as years come on the vigor of youth departs but it is succeeded by accomplishments more respectable what time takes from mens bodies it generally adds to their minds in proportion as the decay of their strength unqualifies them for executing their experience and prudence sit them for contriving and advising the young sometimes conceitedly prefer their own ignorance to the understanding of the ancients they contemn their counsels because they are unsuitable to their own taste they are headstrong impetuous impatient of control and cast off that deference to the judgment of their elders which would check the violence of their passions and restrain the impulses of their presumption this their way is their lly psalm xlix     experience generally leads them to adopt the very maxims which they once rejected with scorn and convinces them that they would have avoided many errors miscarriages and sufferings if they had been pleased to learn these maxims from the experience of others it is the law of nature it is the will of god that the younger should honor and regard the elder it is the very condition of our being that human creatures should be placed under their elders children are taught by nature to submit to the instruction and rely on the advice of their parents and teachers and in the succeeding periods of life it is by observing those who go before us and learning from them that we become gradually more perfect in the several functions of life often without our reflecting that this is the means by which it happens god thus trains us up in respect to our elders and forms us insensibly to that reverence which is due to old age especially when it is found adorned with piety and virtue and he requires us to pay it this reverence ye younger submit yourselves unto the elder   pet v    is the injunction of an inspired apostle especially reverence such of your elders as are peculiarly related to you children obey your parents in all things for this is wellpleasing unto the lord col iii  0  honor thy father and mother that it may be well with thee and thou may live long on the earth ephesians vi       the subject of this discourse suggests to the young instructions likewise of a more extensive nature it urges them to begin early a religious and holy life it is only when the life has been spent in goodness that true honor is reflected on the hary head age is venerable in itself but flly is sufficient to render it despicable and wickedness is the greatest folly and renders it even detestable honor is due to the aged but by their crimes they may fit their claim to honor would you establish your claim to honor when you shall arrive at old age be good betimes begin early and persist seadily when the life has been spent in virtue that virtue will shine mature and perfect in old age but old age is not the season for beginning to be virtuous when the evil days are already come and the years in which thou have no pleasure when the sun and the light and the moon are already darkened and the clouds return after the rain when the keepers of the house tremble and the strong men bow down themselves and the grinders cease because they are few and those that look out of the windows be darkened and the doors are shul in the strets and the sound of the grinding is low and thou risest up at the voice of the bird and all the daughters of music are brought low and fears are in the way and the grasshopper is a burden and desire has failed and the mourners already go about the streets then it is too late by far too late to begin to be virtuous for then shall the dust return to the earth as it was and the spirit shall return unto god who gave it eccles xii       it is beautiful to behold the fields in harvest covered with corn ripe for the sickle but it cannot be beheld except the corn has been sown in the spring youth is the spring of life remember thy creator in the days of thy youth then if you live to be old your gray hairs shall be a crown of glory and then it shall be of little moment to you whether you live to be old or not for at whatever age you die

though they live long yet shall they be nothing regarded and their last age shall be without honor wisd iii     when a man has lived in sin and grown old in it he inherits the iniquities of his youth and the iniquities of all the successive stages of his life they have been multiplied as his days the guilt of them all remains accumulated on his hoary head the ignominy of them all overspreads his wrinkled face by long practice his vicious habits have become inveterate they clave to him and deform him like a leprosy they are inwrought into all the faculties of his soul they have vitiated them so entirely that often when he can no longer commit his former sins he ruminates upon them with pleasure relates them and recommends them and by thus corrupting the young merits their contempt and execration and infallibly incurs the indignation and abhorrence of every person who has a regard either to virtue or to decency he has no rational sentiments no comfortable reflections no cheerful hopes to relieve the infirmities to allay the pains to soften the sorrows of his decline having lived depraved and despicable his soul as degenerate as his body is decrepid his soul as ready for destruction as his body for corruption in the dust he dies either rushing into misery unthinking as the sheep are laid in the grave psalm xlix     or meeting it with horror despair and anguish horrible is the end of the unrighteous generation wisd iii     when they cast up the accounts of their sins they shall come with fear and their own iniquities shall convince them to their face chap iv  0  at every age vice is the greatest folly for at every age men may be hurried in a moment to suffer the punishment of vice but in old age vice is perfect madness for the hoary sinner must quickly be summoned to his doom how dreadfully dangerous is your state you have all the sins of a long life to repent of you have all the habits of a long life to eradicate and you have no time remaining for it your sun is already setting and you have not yet begun the work of the day how shall you be able to finish it repent immediately and pray god if perhaps thy wickedness may be forgiven thee acts viii

you shine forth you are as the morning you are secure because there is hope and may take your rest in safety job xi        but remember that your period of life as well as the periods which you have already passed has its peculiar duties and its peculiar temptations therefore the apostle exhorts that the aged men be sober vigilant grave temperate sound in aith in charity in patience the aged women likewise that they be in behavior as becomes holiness not false accusers not given to much wine teachers of good things tit ii      be careful to practice all the duties and to resist all the temptations of your condition thus you shall still bring forth fruit in old age psalm xcii     employ your prudence in enlightening the inexperience of youth in checking its violence and preventing its wanderings at the same time make great allowance for the gaiety the ignorance the agerness which are inseparable from youth you will insinuate your documents most effectually when you invite the young to listen to them by the cheerfulness of your hearts by the sweetness of your manners and by the candor of your sentiments under your growing infirmities uphold yourselves by the apprbation of your consciences by firm confidence in the mercy and munificence of god through jesus christ by the hope of immortality just at hand supported by these you may bear your pains with patience and meet your decays with resignation sully not the honors of your age by peevishness discontent or ill humor manifest the energy of religion by the composure the meekness and the wisdom of your demeanor draw off your affections more than ever from this world which you are now so very soon to leave be not so busy as heretofore in the pursuit of those earthly things which now can profit you for so very short a moment employ more time than ever in retirement and devotion examine your past life over and over renew your repentance for all your sins if there be in your souls any remaining stain derived from the cares or the pleasures of the world labor to wash it out if there be any passion yet irregular mortify it more completely if any virtue be still weak set yourselves to strengthen it if your former vices have left any evil consequences repair them as much as possible if in any duty you have been defective endeavor to supply what was wanting let your thoughts be sixth on the heavenly state from which you are now separated by so thin a veil render it familiar to yourselves by frequent meditation accustom yourselves to its employments by giving full scope to all the pious and all the benevolent affections from the perfect exercise of which a great part of the happiness of heaven will arise  sermon ix the diversity of mens natural tempers prove xxv    he that has no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down and without walls the spirit of a man is an expression which has different significations in scripture and particularly in the book of proverbs it sometimes signifies the powers of the understanding as when solomon says the spirit of a man is the candle of the lord prove xx     it sometimes denotes the passion of anger he that rules his spirit and he that is low to anger are used as synomymous terms chap xvi    and he that is hasty of spirit is opposed to him that is slow to wrath chap xiv     the spirit sometimes means a temper disposition or turn of mind in general thus we read of an haughty spirit chap xvi    and of an humble spirit ver     this is perhaps the meaning of the expression in my text by him that has no rule over his own spirit may be meant the person who has no government of his passions and of this person it is affirmed that he is like a city that is broken down and without walls he lie open to every vice to which exorbitant passion can expose him and may therefore be compared to a city the fortifications of which have been erased and into which every enemy may enter at pleasure but the expression may without any impropriety be taken in a sens somewhat more restrained for a mans particular temper or predominant turn of mind and solomon may be understood to assert that he who has no command over his natural temper or peculiar bias is in danger of running into every sin  it is in this light that i propose to considr the text i design to treat of the government of what we call a mans natural temper it is a duty of great moment it is an important part of the duty which we owe to ourslvs but it is a duty on which we bestow too little attention the generality of men seem never to think that it is either possible or requisite to lay any restraint upon themselves in this particular but give full indulgence to their peculiar temper and think it a sufficient excuse for whatever this leads them to do amiss that it is their temper and they cannot help it even good men do not reflect sufficiently on the obligation of this duty nor set themselves with steadiness enough to rectify their natural tempers this renders it the more necessary to discourse professedly on this subject in discoursing on it i shall  first explain the origin and the nature of the variety of tempers among mankind  secondly evine the necessity of our governing each his peculiar temper by pointing out the ill consequences of neglecting it and  thirdly enquire what is implied in the government of a mans natural temper  the present discourse shall be employed in explaining the origin and the nature of the variety of tempers among mankind  that god who is the creator of the world delights in variety throughout all his works the same god is the father of our spirits heb xii    and he has formed them also with considerable variety it is a composed variety that takes place in the creation of god it is consistent with genuine simplicity and uniformity all matter has the same effential properties yet the forms into which god has molded it and the purposes to which he has applied the several parts of it are infinitely different in like manner the souls of all men are endued with the same faculties but from the degrees in which they possess these faculties and from the proportions in which they are combined there results an endlss diversity of characters in the human species among the diversitis of character of which men are susceptible there s scarcely any more remarkable or more interesting than that which belongs to the natural temper this diversity may be increased by a difference in the education and culture which men receive and in the habits which they contract but it is not produced by these it is founded in the original constitution for it appears in children from their very bith and it contines to distinguish persons who have received the same culture and acquired the same habits both the temperament of the body and the turn of the mind contribute to form the peculiar bent the latter requires principally to be regarded for it influences the temper most directly the former affects it only indirectly by first affecting the turn of the mind besides it is only so far as the natural temper is founded in the turn of the mind that it is capable of being governed it arises both from the peculiar make of the understanding and from the construction of the passions and active powers but in most instances the latter is its chief and most immediate cause and that either by the predominance of one passion in the constitution or by the general tone of all the passions  before we enter on a more particular investigation of these causes it will be proper to premise one observation under this head we consider the several tempers simply in themselves and not either those excsses of them which are vicious or that regulation of them which is virtuous yet it will be unavoidable often to speak of them by names which imply approbation or disapprobation especially the latter the reason is that as all tempers are most obvious in their excesses and as some are very apt to run into excess we have in many instances no name for the temper itself as distinguished from the abuse of it we must be on our guard against deception from this imperfection of language and endeavor as much as possible to conceive every temper that shall be mentioned as in itself indifferent however readily it may on the one hand degenerate into vice or however easily it may on the other hand be improved into virtue  no man is altogether destitute of any passion or affection belonging to human nature but no man has all his passions balanced against one another with perfect exactness and no two men have them all proportioned to one another precisely in the same degree here is a fruitful source of varieties of temper whatever passion is predominant gives a correspondent cast to the whole soul and produces a suitable complexion  some of our passions and affections are most directly subservient to our own private interest and some of them have other men for their objects when those of the former sort prevail the temper will be selfish and contracted when those of the latter class are predominant the temper will be open and social many distinct affections belong to each of these classes and every affection belonging to either of them produces a turn of temper congruous to itself  we daily meet with characters both good and bad which are founded in and derive their peculiar complexion from an original and natural turn to those affections whether sentiments or desires which are properly selfish some for instance are prone to pride it assumes very different forms according to the causes by which it is produced and the expressions to which it most directly tends and every form of it gives rise to a correspondent particularity of temper hence the stately the haughty the arrogant the insolent the conceited the vain the dignified turn of mind and many others which language cannot mark with precision but which the discrning eye readily distinguishes when they occur in the commerce of the world tempers as various take their rise from an opposite propensity of soul to humility a love of honors power preeminence distinction forms the temper of some indifference about all these is a striking feature in other characters a high relish and a great fondness for what is pleasant forms the basis of some characters and insensibility to the impressions of pleasure that of others some men are naturally turned to the love of riches others to the neglect of them  when the malevolent passions have a tendency to predominate in the soul they occasion all those diversities of temper to which we apply the epithets sour sullen morose severe captious peevish passionate illhumoured and the like  on the contrary the prevalence of the benevolent and kind affections of the heart produces a great variety of tempers some of which we term the sweet the gentle the mild the soft the courteous the tender the sympathising the affectionate the generous  every affection assumes different forms according to the different situations in which its object is placed it exerts itself in desire or aversion in hope or fear in joy or sorrow but every man has not by his constitution an equal propensity to all these exertions of affection some are prone to desire this renders them naturally keen eager or enterprising and apt to become anxious and solicitous others are more turned to aversion and in consequence of this are naturally cautious wary circumspect and liable to care fretfulness and disgust hope is predominant in some men and fear in others the former produces a temper of elation confidence and greater enterprise than would have arisen from the prevalence of desire alone the latter produces a temper cowardly timid dejected suspicious or foreboding there is not perhaps any affection in the operation of which the opposite tempers now mentioned may be seen more strongly contrasted than the love of money in one person this principle shows itself by pushing for great advantages embarking in extensive undertakings and running every risk for the sake of becoming very rich he is actuated properly by the desire of wealth supported by forward hopes the same attachment to money makes another man cautious in all his schemes sparing in every sort of expense apt to forfit great possible gain rather than expose himself to the hazard of any loss this is the miser his conduct proceeds either from aversion to and dread of poverty or from desire of wealth continually checked and converted into timorous anxiety by the predominance of ear some men have a natural propensity to run into joy this occasions cheerfulness and gaity of temper in all its forms other men are most apt to be touched with sorrow and they are constitutionally pensive or gloomy or melancholy this difference accounts in some degree for a diversity of character which we may often observe there are persons who have borne obsurity poverty and even affliction with great composure and equanimity but have been excessively elated and dissipated by prosperity their natural cheerfulness relieved the former but being encouraged by the latter ran into an extreme on the other hand there are persons who can bear prosperity with great moderation but are perfectly sunk by adversity their natural propensity is to sorrow when it is irritated by distress it overwhelms them when it is counteracted by the joys of a prosperous lot it is restrained from every excess  thus all the affections and passions according as one or another of them is predominant tinge the whole soul with their own peculiar hue  we may observe farther that very great diversities of temper may proceed from the same passion only by its being predominant in different manners the passionate temper and the peevish are extremely different yet they both proceed from the predominance of the very same principle sudden anger deliberate anger produces in those who have a propensity to it many distinctions of temper unlike to both these whatever be the varieties of which any passion is susceptible in respect of its causes its objects its feeling or its tendencies the temper founded in that passion will be susceptible of all the same varieties  it may be remarked likewise that some tempers proceed from the weakness of a particular disposition more properly than from a predominance of the contrary courage so far as it is constitutional proceeds merely from the absence of fear impudence is not the prevalence of any positive affection but only the want of shame a reserved temper at least in many instances belongs to this head the person is not actuated by those principles which lead others to a free communication of their sentiments and designs that a distinction of temper should arise from a defect in one mental principle cannot be surprising some vices are altogether negative they consist not in any bad affection they indicate only the want of a good one some virtues in like manner are not positive exertions of laudable affections but arise from the restraint and proper government of such passions as tend to vice the human soul is a complicated machine its state and character are not determined by any one part of it but result from the balancings the relations and the harmonious adjustment of all the parts a want or a relative weakness in any one of the numerous parts of a clock affects the soundness of the whole machine  this principle suggests another observation the several passions and affections are in different men combined in an infinite variety of ways and every particular combination of them produces a distinct temper perhaps every temper when it is analyzed with the utmost accuracy will be found not to arise from the prevalence of a single affection but to derive its form in some degree from the union of several thus in a compounded color different ingredients are mixed and may be observed on attention though one be so much predominant as to give it its common denomination thus fainter traces of several dispositions are often discernible in a countenance which yet receives its principal expression and general form from one affection but in some tempers the union of different principles is more obvious and their influence more equal than in others to produce a temper turned to ridicule both a prevalence of the malevolent passions and a propensity to cheerfulness must concur without the latter the temper would lead to mere invective and bitter railing the united prevalence of joy and benevolent affection forms a peculiarity of temper different from what would result from the prevalence of either of these alone if there be any of your acquaintance marked with this amiable peculiarity you will know it by finding their mirth constantly intended to promote your pleasure and by a winning readiness and alacrity accompanying all their good offices in a modest temper humility and a sense of propriety meet in almost equal measures affability is a temper which cannot be formed but by the union of many sentiments and affections which will be easily discovered by attention to its appearances and exertions some affections are apter to mingle together into one temper than others but no affections are so opposite as not sometimes to be conjoined to mitigate the contrarieties of each other and then to be blended into one turn of soul hence arise those heterogeneous and absurd biasses which we now and then meet with and wonder at as singularities  in all these ways the predominance of some passions and affections or of others is a source of many varieties of temper of more indeed than language has distinct names for expressing though we can discern each of them when we meet with it in life  but it is not only by the prevalence of some of them in comparison with the rest that the passions produce diversities of temper among mankind the general tone also of all the passions occasions a suitable peculiarity a musical instrument acquires different tones by having all its strings wound up to different keys the passions of different persons are as it were wound up to a variety of keys and thence their souls deive distinct tones of temper in some men all the passions are high and strong brisk and lively had these men no one passion more dominant than the rest this general vivacity of the passions would produce a peculiarity of temper congruous to itself it is the cause of those distinctions of temper which can be characterized by sensibility ardour activity vehemence violence impetuosity in other men all the passions are weak and languid this renders the temper in a degree proportioned to their dullness insensible insipid sluggish indolent cool or composed  in order to perceive in its full extent the influence of the general tone of the passions on the formation of the temper we must observe that it may be combined with any predominant passion whatever peculiarity of temper a person derives from the prevalence of one passion a high tone of all the passions will render more striking and more strongly marked than it would have otherwise been it is in men of warm passions that the natural temper shows itself with the greatest force and most precisely discriminated from all other turns of mind when the passions are feeble the temper of the soul whatever be the passion of which it holds may be compared to those faces which having little characteristical or distinctive the painter finds difficulty in taking off the tone of the passions admits many gradations it is the immediate cause of as many particularities of temper every gradation of which it is susceptible may be united with any one predominant passion and every different conjunction will occasion a new cast of mind tempers arising from the predominance of the same passion are in many instances so much diversified by the tone of the passions as to be distinguished even in common language by peculiar names the joyous temper is distinct from the cheerful the affectionate from the gentle the prevailing passion is the same but its tone is different  though the passions be the most immediate causes of the varieties of temper and though on that account they required our first and principal notice in explaining these varieties yet it must be observed not only that the understanding has some influence on every peculiarity of temper but also that some peculiarities of it cannot be at all explained without taking into the account the turn and degree of the understanding nay that some peculiarities of temper are occasioned almost wholly by the form of the intellectual powers some men have a propensity to observe accurately without any formed design whatever comes in their way this propensity lays the foundation of an attentive turn the habit of observing things confirms that turn a heedless temper arises from the want of this propensity some men can easily remove their attention from one object and immediately employ it with as great closeness on another some cannot readily disengage their thoughts from what has once engrossed them the influence of these opposite casts of understanding on the temper is very conspicuous in the man who can observe all the proprieties of quickly varying situations in the man who can adapt himself successively to dissimilar companies or in the man who can apply without distraction and with equal ardor to a multiplicity of occupations you see the operation of the former and you will as clearly perceive the operation of the latter in the contrary characters which frequently occur in great variety some men have reasoning minds whatever object is before them they place it in every attitude they view it in every light they investigate all its consequences this turn of understanding lays the foundation of a considerate provident temper the contrary turn of a thoughtless rash improvident temper there is a credulous and there is a skeptical temper they are founded in opposite turns of understanding but these opposite turns generally imply the same intellectual weakness an incapacity of perceiving the force of evidence quickly and precisely this incapacity leads one man to admit all the evidence that is proposed to him by hindering him from perceiving its defects and it leads another to reject all the evidence that is offered by rendering him insensible of its strength on this account what we often remark as surprising and unaccountable that credulity and incredulity are found in the same characters both in very high degrees that the greatest skeptics and infidels on some subjects show the weakest easiness of faith on others is natural and even unavoidable a sound discernment of the real force of evidence would prevent both extremes when the understanding is clear and decisive it lays the foundation of a firm and determined temper an inability to form a clear opinion produces ickleness and inconsistence  for explaining the variety of tempers it will be proper to make another observation the same temper may in different men proceed from different causes it was formerly observed that some men are composed in adversity but elated by prosperity and others moderate in prosperity but dejected by adversity and that the difference may often be accounted for from the predominance of cheerfulness in the former and of sorrow in the latter when it proceeds from this cause the elation of the former shows itself in giddiness and levity and the dejection of the latter in melancholy but the difference proceeds in many instances from another cause when pride is predominant in the constitution adversity may be no more than it requires to check to moderate and to restrain it within proper bounds prosperity inflames it and gives it scope in insolence and arrogance on the contrary when there is a strong propensity to humility it may need prosperity to counteract it adversity sinks it into depression meanness or pusillanimity in some instances both causes operate and impress on the character traces suitable to each eagerness of temper may arise from a great predominance of one passion or it may arise from a high tone of all the passions a grave temper we should at first sight be apt to impute in every instance to the want of a propensity to joy yet it is often found without any predominance of sorrow in some cases it proceeds from a moderate tone of all the passions in others from a thoughtful considerate turn of mind there are cases in which it has causes different from all these one cause of a reserved temper was mentioned already the want of those dispositions which lead men to communicate their sentiments but it may proceed from very different principles from modesty for instance or from suspiciousness or from sullenness or from pride the source of ickleness and inconstancy is sometimes weakness of judgment sometimes timidity and sometimes the keenness of all the passions hurrying a man continually into new puruits according as they happen to be excited in their turns a temper of rashness and precipitation may proceed from an improvident judgment from the absence of fear and caution or from the violence of any passion but still though tempers thus proceeding from different causes are often so similar as to come under the same common denomination yet they are not precisly the same they are confounded by the generality but a judicious eye can distinguish them they are like those faces which have a strong resemblance in their general cast but differ considerably in their particular features there is a peculiarity in each congruous to its own cause to discern this peculiarity and to perceive the cause from which it is derived is absolutely necessary for our forming a right judgment concerning a persons temper when the causes of similar tempers are very analogous the distinction of these tempers may be very delicate and will require great acuteness to perceive it but it is often obvious enough similar tempers sometimes arise from very unlike causes nay from such as are opposite when they do the dullest can discriminate them a temper of firmness arises from a clear perception of the reasons of a certain conduct obstinacy may arise from an incapacity of perceiving these reasons both imply constancy but none will be at a loss to discern the difference between them generally however the principles which produce similar tempers have some analogy some fitness to coalesce when they have some degree of them all often appears in the temper though a greater degree of one of them gives it the predominant tinge  as similar tempers may proceed from dissimilar causes so even opposite tempers may proceed from the same cause under a former head we have already found an example of this we have found the skeptical temper and the credulous ultimately resolved into the same imbecility of understanding an inability of clearly discerning the real force of evidence this inability likewise gives rise to an obstinate temper in some to a wavering temper in others one is immovable in all his designs because he is incapable of discerning the strength of those reasons which should persuade him to alter them another is ickle in them all because he cannot see the weakness of the reasons which are produced against them  such are the general causes of the diversity of tmprs among mankind they ae capable of numberless combinations and every combination of them produces a distinct temper as no two plants are exactly alike as no two human faces are absolutely undistinguishable so no two tempers are prfectly the same every man has his own spirit his peculiar temper by which he differs from every other man to enumerate all the peculiarities of temper is impossible what has been said will be sufficient to prepare us both for perceiving the necessity and for understanding the manner of governing our own temper it may likewise suggest useful reflections to us i shall conclude this discourse by mentioning a few of them    each of us should study to know his own particular temper know thyself was one of the most approved precepts of ancient wisdom know ye not your own selves cor xiii    is the expostulation of a christian apostle the knowledge of our natural temper is one important part of the knowledge of ourselves our temper has an extensive influence on our conduct the government of it is of great moment but for governing it a previons knowledge of it is absolutely necessary our temper affects our judgments as well as our conduct to the gloomy there is nothing in nature cheerful to the gay religion seems to require no restraint or selfdenial every thing appears provoking to the peevish every peculiarity of temper if it be ungoverned is a jaundiced eye which tinges all things with its own color and will make us dupes to some prejudice of its own complexion ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of luke ix     was a severe rebuke which our savior gave the sons of zebedee on one occasion if we be ignorant of our real temper we fall under the rebuke every person with whom we converse quickly discovers our temper and can make his advantage of it it is shameful that ourselves alone should not discover it we can make the greatest advantage by the discovery many are so totally ignorant of themselves that you shall find persons every day disclaiming in the most explicit terms that very temper which all the world knows to be in a palpable excess their own the passionate man praises his own weakness the implacable thanks god that he is not given to resentment the contentious applauds his own love of peace the giddy admires his own sedateness the obstinate declares himself the readiest of all men to receive conviction the proud the assuming the overbearing magnifies his condescension his lowliness and his affability i am persuaded the mention of these instances has called up to your thoughts living characters of your acquaintance but it may be that some of yourselves have been thought of by others as it examples of this selfignorance labor each of you to know your peculiar bias it is by careful attention to the workings of your hearts and the actions of your lives that you can learn it you will find it mingling with them all and giving them a correspondent cast and manner remark its tendency this is what you should set yourselves to regulate or counteract observe what are the ill effects which it is aptest to produce these are what you must endeavor to prevent investigate its cause enquire what is the particular principle or disposition from the predominance of which it proceeds to examine the several sources of the diversity of tempers is entertaining it is useful also as it prepares us for discovering the source of our own temper but it is this discovery that is immediately improving it is the application of the general examination to this purpose that is of chief importance the knowledge of the real cause of our peculiar temper is necessary for the government of it in every case the prevention or the cure of a disease can be effected only by removing its cause    a proper sense of the endless variety of tempers in the human species would lead us to make greater allowance for the sentiments and conduct of others than we often do to ourselves we often arrogate indulgence on account of our peculiar temper much greater than can be reasonable to others we generally give no indulgence on account of the peculiarity of tempers did we consider how difficult it is to govern the natural temper did we reflect how imperfectly we often govern our own and how often it betrays us into what is faulty and were we at the same time disposed to judge and to act equitably with respect to others we could not fail to make great allowances even for the real faults into which their temper leads them great as they may be in the sight of god our judgment of them should be mild and our conduct in consequence of them indulgent and forbearing we may find in ourselves sometimes an excuse for them always an extenuation of them but we on the contrary often form an unfavourable opinion of others entertain hatred of them or treat them ill merely for such differences in their natural temper as are really free from vice the grave and the melancholy are apt to reckon the most innocent cheerfulness and mirth profane and ungodly the gay and cheerful too readily charge the serious with grimace and hypocrisy the man of openness shuns him who is naturally reserved as artful cunning and designing examples might easily be multiplied have we not candor enough to recollect what is so extremely obvious that the tempers of others are very different from ours would you find fault with others because the features of their faces are not the same with those of your own the tempers of men are as various as their faces they can no more eradicate the peculiarity of their tempers than destroy the distinction of their looks they cannot but do the very same action in different manners by attention to this one principle how many differences animosities dislikes misconstructions and ill offices would be prevented among men how much would the virtues of forbearance candor and mutual love be promoted    the amazing diversity of tempers in the human species is a striking instance of the contrivance and wisdom of the god who made us variety combined with uniformity may be considered as the very characteristic of design a perfect combination of them is an indication of perfect wisdom of such combination obvious through the whole creation the endless variety of natural tempers in creatures who have all the same essential powers and produced by so delicate variations of these powers is an illustrious example it proclaims that god our father is wise it proves that the creator of mankind is wonderful in counsel and excellent in working isa xxviii     let us admire let us adore his wisdom manifested in the constitution of our own nature and in this particular part of it our thoughts our feelings our motions may every moment put us in mind to adore it let us celebrate the wisdom of our maker with praises suitable to it saying with david i will praise thee for i am fearfully and wonderfully made mavelous are thy works and that my soul knows right well psalm cxxxix      sermon x the necessity of governing the natural temper prove xxv    he that has no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down and without walls in the last discourse i explained the origin and the nature of the variety of tempers which is found among mankind in this discourse i propose to evince the necessity of our governing each his own peculiar temper  is it then needful to evince the necessity of a mans governing his own temper every man acknowledges that all others ought to govern their tempers and complains of them when they do not by this every man acknowledges that the government of the temper is a duty of indispensible obligation yet there is very great need to enforce it for every man almost pleads a privilege to neglect it in his own particular case as long as men do this it never will be practiced it is not our owning a duty to be incumbent upon others but our perceiving it to be incumbent upon ourselves that will lead us to the performance of it that we may perceive how much it is the duty of every one of us to govern his own temper let us attend to the ill effects of neglecting to govern it they are pointed out by an expressive figure in the text he that has no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down and without walls he has no security against abandoning himself to every vice this is an alarming motive to the government of the temper if the neglect of it has any tendency to vice it must have a very strong tendency the influence of our particular temper runs through our whole life and mixes with every action of it the consequences of an ungoverned temper must therefore be very extensive the whole of our conduct must be vitiated this observation sets the importance of governing the temper in a very striking light if it be at all a duty it is a momentous duty for evincing that it is a duty it will be sufficient to show that the neglect of it leads to vice and in showing this with the fullest evidence there will be little difficulty  every natural temper is innocent in itself it may likewise be made conducive to virtue but every temper is at the same time apt to degenerate into some vice to make the temper subservient to virtue or even to preserve it innocent attention and care in restraining and odelling it are absolutely necessary just as the soil requires culture in order to its producing a crop of useful grain but as the ground whenever it is not cultivated runs into wildness and nourishes useless or noxious weeds so that our natural temper may lead s into the vices suited to it and occasion us all the misery involved in them nothing is necessary but to leave it to itself to neglect to rule it our becoming abandoned to these ices at least is the necessary consequence of the neglect the strictest government of the tempr which our imperfection permits cannot prevent our being duced by these vices in some instances where there is no government at all the man must be enslaved by them  there is not a single vice to which some turn of temper does not directly tend and therefore there is not a single vice into which one man or another will not be led by neglecting to govern his natural temper this  in a very great measure the cause of all the variety of vicious characters which digrace the human species some have been led by particular causes into courses of vice from which their natural temper was abhorrent but the greatest part addict themselves to the vices which most fall in with it there is some vice which easily falls in with every turn of temper and unavoidably arises from the indulgence of it  need i point out minutely the vices to which the indulgence of a contracted and selfish temper naturally leads will it not be readily acknowledged by all that vice is the certain consequence of the indulgence it will be only difficult for the generality to form a conception of a contracted temper so carefully corrected as not to include vice in the very idea of it selfishness is a term which we never use in a favorable sense a certain proof that a propensity to it is very apt to become vicious the selfish affections are various they turn to different objects but it requires the strictest government to prvent a temper founded on the prevalence of any of them from degenerating into the correspondent vice ambition or vanity or avarice or sensuality and the love of pleasure these are all the names of vices and of vices which when they rise to a great height and are indulged without control render the characters detestable in which they are the leading principles we regard prid with a somewhat less unfavourable eye than any of the selfish deires we allow that there are species of it which are innocent or even virtuous but some epithet must be applied to mark them it is an affection so apt to become vicious and so frequently found in a faulty form that pride without an epithet always denotes a vice to its excesses names are appropriated expressive of the greatest baseness a man naturally turned to pride without governing his temper becomes haughty or arrogant or insolent one superciliously dspises those with whom he lives the stateliness of his carriage proclaims how much he rckons them below him he disdains to take notice of them another is perpetually claiming extravagant respect he is not satisfied with his own opinion of his superiority he demands that you should own it he anxiously displays it he makes a show of his riches before the poor man and of his pomp before the mean if you refuse him homage if you yield it in any degree of moderation you ant him and he becomes your enemy one affects affability and lowliness but he forces you to fel that he thinks he is condescending very far in treating you as his equal another is overbearing he reckons you much his inferior he thinks you dependent upon him perhaps he studies to render you dependent at any rate he treats you as if you were he mortifies you with all the petulance of insult such characters are detestable and they arise infallibly from ungoverned pride even humility of all the private affections the most approveable if it predominated in the temper and were put under no regulation would sink into a feeble a mean and an abject spirit which is blameable in itself and chills every great and worthy effort of the soul  it is still less necessary to enter into a long detail of the detestable vices which spring from a temper founded in a propensity to any of the malevolent passions it will universally be confessed that such tempers if not very carfully corrected must produce characters deservedly odious they lead to vices which spread misery through society and which overwhelm the person himself with greater misery than he brings upon those around him habitual peevishness producing fretfulness on every the slightest occasion putting one out of humor with every person and every thing creating incessant uneasiness to those who are connected with him eating out the enjoyment of life is the natural effect of a temper founded on a propensity to anger though accompanied with the weakest tone of passion the same propensity joined to a higher tone of passion leads to vices of a still more pernicious tendency to licentious reproaches extravagant menaces vehemence rage and fury it harasses inferiors and dependents it provokes and alienates the dearest friends it stains conversation with rudeness and brutality in a moment it precipitates into injuries which can never be repaired and into crimes which ntail bitter repentance on the whole succeeding part of life but when the propensity is not to short fits of passion frequently recurring but to permanent and deliberate anger the indulgence o i produces the blackest vices it renders the whole behavior captious and perverse it infects every action with harshness and bitterness it settles into malice it grows up into envy it exerts itself in revenge it breaks forth into rancour it degenerates into cruelty it employs power in creating misery and spreading desolation it takes occasion even from religion for persecution and bloody massacre  but alas even those best of tempers in which the kind affections prevail will be productive of very destructive vices if they are not governed with care every day we meet with persons who have become vicious by indulging a temper of this kind one man is ociable he indulges his love of company and he becomes dissipated and neglects every material duty of life he falls into ill company and he is corrupted another is soft in his nature and cannot bear to disoblige he falls in with vicious men to oblige them he grants whatever they are pleased to ask he consents to what he knows to be wrong he sins with them good nature it is even commonly observed exposes a person to dangerous temptations a sympathizing temper often degenerates into weaknesses greatly blameable generosity of temper readily shoots up into prodigality and ruinous extravagance and the warm and affectionate heart needs to be held in with a steady rein else it will rush forward into unlawful testimonies of kindness and unrighteous acts of friendship  in whatever way our temper most disposes the several passions and affections to exert themselves it will without regulation prove the source of peculiar vices when the propensity to desire renders the temper ken and eager if we lay it under no restraint if we be not at pains both to direct it to proper objects and to moderate the degree of it it must engage us in trifling and vicious pursuits in respect of the object of our pursuit whether pleasure profit or power it must render us craving and insatiable ever unsatisfied with what we have obtained wishing and plotting for more and in respect of the means of prosecution it must render us impetuous and violent regardless of the bounds of right impatient of every delay and opposition we shall fret and rage at the disappointment of wishes which ought never to have been formed and the inefficacy of means which ought never to have been employed is the opposite propensity to aversion indulged every thing wears a gloomy aspect and is viewed on its darkest side we act as if we were resolved never to be pleased we search for occasions of disgust regret and uneasiness and we find them in every object every gentle affection is banished from the breast discontent fretfulness and ill humor become habitual a temper of confidence easily degenerates into presumption it engages a man in impracticable enterprises and makes him sure of success in them it makes him look on impossibilities as merely difficulties he hopes and he strains every nerve to overcome them he attempts even the most unlawful means he is plunged into disappointment when he least thinks of it hurried into all the vices which disappointment produces in the sanguine and overwhelmed with anguish proportioned to the elevation of his former hopes another gives full scope to the timidity of his natural disposition he dares not attempt any thing that is worthy the slightest danger can terrify him into the basest conduct he falls into all the sins and into all the miseries which belong to the cowardly the suspicious the jealous the cunning the desponding the sorrowful cast of mind become excessive renders even a mans virtues forbidding and disposes him to vices which can only torment him a cheerful temper is amiable but when it is ungoverned it is the source of many vicious characters the man who abandons himself to dissolute mirth and jollity without regard to the propriety of subjects or of situations the person who trifles in unceasing levity incapable of serious thought or of a moments sedate behavior the insignificant fluttering in a continual round of gay amusements at leisure for none of the duties of life the wretch who runs from pleasure to pleasure and gives himself up to false and riotous joys all these characters and many more spring in a great measure from cheerfulness of temper indulged without control  when the general tone of the passions is high it exposes a man to all the vices in their turn which can arise from the excess of any passion and most to those which arise from the strength of his ruling passion when it gives too great sensibility to the temper it renders a man prone to all the weaknesses which naturally spring from love or hatred from joy or sorrow from any of the emotions of the soul immoderately indulged according to the different ways in which his sensibility happens successively to be touched when it produces violence and impetuosity it needs but an occasion to hurry a person into all the crimes which anger malice revenge extravagant desire presumptuous hope or any the most restless passion in human nature can suggest if the man who has a keen and ardent temper turn not to virtue he must be bold and uncontrollable in all his vices but to virtue he cannot be supposed to turn if he have no rule over his own spirit for virtue is always founded in selfgovernment when on the contrary the passions are low and languid and render a man unfeeling sluggish and inactive if he be at no pains to counteract this disposition is it possible that he can avoid the sins of omission the vices of neglect of the meltings of compassion of the efforts of benevolence of the labors of love   thessalonians i   heb vi  0  of the fervours of devotion of the actings of zeal for god and goodness of all the alacrity and vigorous energies of virtue he is incapable until he raise himself above the natural insipidity of his temper if he may be harmless he cannot be useful slothfulness casts into a deep sleep prove xix     the slothful hides his hand in his bosom it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth chap xxvi     his hands refuse to labor chap xxi     his way is an hedge of thorns chap xv      it will not be necessary for our purpose to examine what are the vices congenial to every one of the varieties of temper which were formerly pointed out as arising from the several mental powers either separately or differently combined together from the instances already produced it is sufficiently plain that every turn of temper leads naturally to some vice or another to these instances let us however subjoin a very few more courage may very readily degenerate into fierceness reserve into sullenness and openness of temper into such unwariness as betrays the secrets or the interests of the dearest friend a prudent turn of mind is easily corrupted into cunning and the smallest propensity to thoughtlessness may terminate in the most destructive rashness and precipitation credulity lays a man open to many means of seduction and a tendency to doubt may grow up into such skepticism as shall enervate every principle of virtue and annihilate every motive to the practice of it a firm and steady temper is manly but if it be ungoverned and undirected it may produce obstinacy rendering a man inflexible in his worst actions and designs irreclaimable in all his vices the opposite temper can scarcely by any pains be kept from producing some degree of fickleness and inconstancy which is itself a blemish and if no pains be taken to fix it it will render a person contemptible and little incapable of that persevering goodness which alone can be either useful to men or acceptable to god  the same temper it may be farther observed will lead a man with equal readiness into opposite vices in opposite situations there is an example very common and very commonly taken notice of the same littleness of mind renders a man insolent in prosperity and abject in adversity a man of this turn obtains a fortune and becomes rude to his superiors contemptuous to his equals and oppressive to his inferiors he runs into all extravagance he dissipates his fortune and he is mean and shameless in his poverty shimei casting stones at david and his servants going after him and cursing as he went calling him a bloody man and a man of belial a sam xvi      and shimei a few days after on a reverse of davids fortune the first of all the house of joseph to go down to meet him falling down before him and deprecating punishment   samuel xix        0  is the very same character  that vice be it what it will to which our particular temper directly leads us is an enemy already advanced to the gates of the heart and if it finds the heart like a city without walls it enters at its pleasure we can make no resistance if we have no rule over our own spirit if we do not carefully govern our natural temper we cannot avoid indulging that vice but the indulgence of any one vice is inconsistent with true goodness of character it forfeits our future happiness it excludes us from the favor of god for whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point he is guilty of all jam ii  0  if therefore our becoming a prey to this one vice were the only effect of our neglecting to govern our natural temper it might be sufficient to deter us from the neglect  but this is very far from being the whole effect of our neglecting to govern our natural temper the man who rules not his spirit does not merely become enslaved to one vice in consequence of this he is open to every vice and certainly shall be led into very many vices every ruling sin will require from the man who lives in the indulgence of it the commission of many others for its support for its gratification or for disguising and concealing it and if that sin has by its suitableness to an ungoverned natural temper obtained dominion over us it will not be in our power to abstain from any of these others whenever they become necessary for these purposes this might be illustrated and confirmed by a long detail but it is not needful to produce many instances it lies open to the observation of every man in the daily course of the world few vices at their first approach smile so sweetly or so much put on the look of innocence as the love of pleasure but let a man by giving a loose to his natural temper be once abandoned to the love of pleasure and the vices are innumerable by which he must necessarily be contaminated it quickly brings on a disrelish of every enjoyment and of every sentiment superior to the gratifications of sensuality and the suggestions of appetite no office of kindness no exertion in doing good must be expected from the sensualist the labor of performing it would break in upon the indolence and destroy the gaiety of the present hour his pleasures are expensive in supporting them he dissipates all the wealth that is his own he covets that of other men as the means of continuing his riots he becomes the slave of avarice he goes beyond the lowest miser in rapacity extortion rapine and dishonest arts gratitude to a benefactor fidelity to a friend the claims of innocence the sacred rights of marriage often stand between him and the indulgence on which his soul is set they must all be overleaped all the stratagems of seduction all the methods of perfidy must be practiced the tyrant of his heart demands it this very tyrant got possession of davids heart for a little while and it led him first meanly to attempt imposing a spurious offspring on his valiant faithful and zealous servant and afterward basely to lay a snare for his life and expose him to certain destruction in bravely serving him if it could produce deeds so foul in a short period of usurpation what a series of crimes will it not produce when it is quietly settled on the throne for life vanity is perhaps in itself one of the most harmless of the vicious passions it is reckoned the object rather of ridicule than of indignation but let it predominate in the temper and be indulged without reserve it will lead to vices well deserving of our most serious indignation it will prompt a man to falsehood and lies in order to raise admiration of his abilities or his exploits it will hurry him on to an expense of ostentation which his fortune cannot bear to meanness and injustice for supporting it and to every wile however unlawful for hiding the poverty which it has produced it will make him betray a trust sacrifice the rights of others or venture on the basest actions when by so doing he can display his importance to the great or catch the applauses of the multitude it will seduce him to deny the most momentous truths to laugh at the most sacred obligations to propagate the most pernicious maxims that he may appear superior to the vulgar generosity is an amiable temper but the man who has allowed the generosity of his nature to lead him into profusion will soon become guilty of all the vices which seem necessary for retrieving his distressed circumstances and will find his heart embittered against mankind by the ingratitude of those on whom he injudiciously lavished his favors when such faults of temper as these can beget so many and so heinous vices it is surely needless to trace out the innumerable progeny of those turns of temper which tend still more strongly to multiply crimes every page for instance of the history of mankind is full of the enormities of all different kinds which have sprung from the love of power degenerated into boundless ambition and the experience of all ages has verified the apostles assertion that the love of money is the root of all evil   timothy vi  0   but it deserves to be particularly remarked that as soon as the misgovernment of natural temper has subjected a man to one predominant or ruling vice he is no longer proof against even such vices as are in themselves most opposite to that very temper to a person who is under the dominion of any one vice mere temper is not a security against any crime every ones observation will supply him with instances of persons who being engaged in one vicious course have by it been led into sins most contrary to their nature and at the thought of which they would have shuddered if their darling sin had not demanded them and produced insensibility to their baseness with instances of the soft and gentle being brought to act with cruelty and even to venture upon murder of the benevolent and kindhearted laboring to bring ruin upon those who happened to stand in the way of some unlawful project of the generous in the prosecution of some bad design stooping to the most sordid actions of the candid and open betrayed into schemes of artifice dissimulation and falsehood of the timid rushing forward into the most dangerous crimes hence a reflection which is often made and is so obvious as to occur to the least discerning of a person who has become addicted to any vice that it has changed his very nature  thus the man who abandons himself to that one vice which arises from the corruption of his natural temper is from that moment in danger of every sin every predominant vice requires as great a number of other vices to be subservient to it in the course of a wicked life as the ministers whom any tyrant can stand in need of to be the instruments of his cruelty rapacity and lusts in consequence of indulging that vice which suits his particular temper the sinner becomes polluted with many acts of almost all sins and depraved by confirmed habits of very many sins by being like a city without walls destitute of defense against any sin he becomes like a city broken down reduced to ruins desolated uninhabited and uninhabitable and as the prophet foretold of ancient babylon wild beasts of the desert lie there and their houses are full of doleful creatures and owls dwell there and satyrs dance there and the wild beasts of the islands cry in their desolate houses and dragons in their pleasant palaces ii xii        every thing regular fair and worthy is destroyed out of his heart he is filled with all iniquity  after the detail which has been given of the consequences of our neglecting to govern our natural temper can it be necessary to use many words for dissuading us from the neglect can any of you think of pleading your temper as an excuse for any vice do you not see that because your temper leans to that particular vice you ought for that very reason to guard against it with the greater anxiety and care on that side your danger is most imminent and therefore to that side your quickest and your most constant vigilance should be directed can you imagine that god requires you not to employ all the care that is necessary for governing your natural temper to imagine it were to suppose that he gives every man allowance to live in the practice of some one sin for every peculiarity of temper indulged without control it has been clearly shown terminates naturally and inevitably in a correspondent vice nay to imagine it were to suppose that god has granted unlimited permission to commit all sins in some particular situations for there is no sin which the predominant vice springing from the indulgence of a mans natural temper may not at times demand such imaginations are absurd and impious and therefore it must be true that god requires each of us to rule his own spirit to restrain and regulate the prevailing bias of his nature the work is difficult very difficult but since it is a necessary and important work its difficulty ought only to augment our care and diligence in performing it its difficulty will be no excuse for our neglecting it it only renders it a very substantial part of our probation and moral discipline in spite of our greatest care and our most assiduous application the natural temper will i fear start forth now and then into vice the merciful god who knows our frame and remembereth that we are dust psalm ciii     will doubtless reckon this among the infirmities of our nature to which he extends his paternal pity but it will be only with respect to those who sincerely exert themselves in opposing and subduing it those who bestow no pains upon it he will hold to be without excuse and to them he will impute all the corruption and all the crimes which arise from the misgovernment of their temper in this as in every other case gods mercy is great to the failings of the upright but he shows no mercy to any wicked transgressors can you think without horror of the baseness of those multiplied vices with which the habitual misgovernment of your natural temper must in time overspread your souls can you think without terror of the accumulated guilt of all these vices and of the punishment to which they must expose you possessed and actuated by these emotions be roused to every exertion for removing the faulty propensity of your nature it is like a subtle poison pervading all the powers of your souls mixing itself with all your sentiments and actions and infecting them it envenoms the foundation and vitiates all the issues of life while you neglect to govern your natural temper all your endeavors to avoid or to mortify the vices which spring from it will be but like lopping off a few twigs which the vigor of the root will enable quickly to grow again perhaps stronger and more luxuriant than before it is only by setting yourselves at once to govern it to rectify all its perversities that you can lay the axe to the root of the tree and effectually kill all the branches thus shall we in the easiest and most effectual manner by the grace of god render our hearts pure our conduct blameless consistent and uniform and ourselves acceptable to him and fit for the future state of perfection and happiness how we ought to govern our temper so as to answer this important purpose shall be explained in the next discourse  sermon xi the manner of governing the natural temper prove xxv    he that has no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down and without walls that mens natural tempers are by a multitude of causes rendered infinitely various and that every mans governing his own temper is absolutely necessary in order to prevent his being by it precipitated not only into the vices which suit it most but also by means of them into almost every vice and consequently is his indispensible duty has been already shown in two discourses it remains on this subject and shall be the business of this discourse to show how this duty ought to be performed to explain what is implied in the government of the natural temper or in a mans having rule over his own spirit  it implies not that a man destroy his peculiar temper it is the business of government not to exterminate the subjects but to direct to animate and to restrain them properly to extirpate ones natural temper is impossible it is a distinguishing character impressed on every soul by the hand of the almighty which the power of man can no more erase than it can esace the distinctive characters of the several kinds of plants and animals and reduce them all to one kind  if it were possible for a man to destroy his peculiar temper it would not be necessary it would be even pernicious it is for the best purposes that the allwise god has distributed among mankind so great a diversity of tempers could we destroy that diversity all these purposes would be defeated the beautiful variety which at present prevails among the human species would disappear an insipid sameness of character would succeed men would no longer be disposed to different pursuits and manners of acting nor fitted for uniting closely in society all would act in the same manner each would be fit only for solitude or for independence all the delights and all the benefits of social connection and social commerce would be at an end  among all the varieties of temper which men possess there is not one inconsistent with virtue there is not one which duty requires us to endeavor to extirpate we are apt to consider some turns of natural temper as in themselves virtuous or vicious the reason is that the affections from whose predominance some tempers result are naturally friendly to virtue and lead to it when they are cherished and those in the predominance of which other tempers consist tend most directly to vice and lead to it whenever they are indulged the former tempers such for instance as hold of the benevolent affections are in themselves desirable and amiable the latter such for example as proceed from anger or from any of the selfish principles are disagreeable render the practice of some virtues difficult and put men in great danger of becoming vicious our proneness to run into the mistake is the greater because the names given to tempers of the one kind often imply their improvement into virtue and the names given to those of the other kind express that turpitude which belongs to them only when they have degenerated into vice but as the former considered only as natural biasses have no real virtue so the latter considered in the same light are not really vicious it is an unhappiness to be marked with them but it is not sinful in itself they are very liable to abuse and the abuse of them is sinful but the best natural temper may likewise be abused and the abuse of it too is sinful  but though it be neither possible nor necessary to extirpate the natural temper it is both possible and necessary to govern it we every day meet with persons who from good breeding or from prudence can disguise their temper and keep it from showing itself not on one occasion but on many occasions and through a long course of time could not then better principles enable them to correct it we actually see some persons who have corrected very bad natural tempers to a great degree their closest and most intimate friends perceive little starts of them on particular emergences but the general tenor of their behavior retains no vestige of their constitutional fault of temper most of their acquaintance can scarcely believe that ever they were subject to it a physiognomist pretended to discover by his art that the great athenian philosopher socrates was addicted to vices so opposite to his whole conduct and character that all who knew him were disposed to ridicule the pretensions of the physiognomist as absurd but to their astonishment socrates declared that he was by his constitutional biass prone to all the vices which had been imputed to him and that it was only by philosophy that he had got the better of them would it not be shameful if many christians could not make a similar declaration by the power of christian principles the government of the natural temper may certainly be carried to a great height of perfection let us consider what it implies and carefully set ourselves to practice it the government of our peculiar temper may be comprehended in three particulars  that we restrain it from breaking out into sin  that we render it subservient to the practice of virtue  and that we incorporate it with all our virtues    the first object of a mans care in ruling his own spirit is to restrain his natural bias so that it may not become vicious or lead him into sin the least that can be incumbent on us is to keep it within such bounds that it may continue innocent but even this will be very difficult the natural temper may be compared to a constitutional proneness to any bodily distemper which it is possible to prevent from actually breaking out into that distemper or at least from breaking out into other than short and moderate fits of it consistent with an habitual state of health but this can be obtained only by constant attention to the constitution by unintermitted care to observe a regimen fit to counteract it if it be in the least degree neglected the distemper will break out with violence and become mortal in like manner to prevent our natural temper from bringing us under the dominion of those fins which are suitable to it will require the most intense and unwearied diligence in opposing every irregular tendency and restraining every blameable exertion of that temper in avoiding every action which can confirm it and every object and opinion which can increase its faulty bias and in pursuing such a conduct cherishing such opinions and dwelling upon such objects as are fit to wear off that bias diligence in all this is necessary for our avoiding every vice but it is peculiarly necessary for our avoiding that ruling vice to which our constitution makes us to lean most strongly  every passion and affection is weak and plible in the moment of its birth had we always recollection enough to observe and resolution enough to check its first tendency to irregularity our victory over it would be easy but if we let slip this favorable moment it will soon be able to carry us wherever it pleases when thou fittest to eat says solomon put a knife to thy throat if thou be a man given to appetite prove xxii      by the careful observation of this rule by opposing the first rising of the sensual appetite the man who is most strongly turned to pleasure would become capable of abstaining from every excess and from every forbidden species of enjoyment if we could mark the instant in which the desire of riches or of honors begins to render us uneasy in the want of them and to suggest improper methods of pursuing them the instant in which pride begins to swell the heart malevolence to imbitter the spirit sociability to throw off the restraints of virtue desire to grow up into rapacity or carefulness and hope into presumption laughter to become mad  i   sorrow to degenerate into dejection or fear into despondence the instant in which reserve verges toward sullenness in which modesty makes us think of omitting what our soul approves in which we feel an inclination to resist evidence by which we are convinced or to strive to believe what we cannot perceive to be proved or to persist in a course which we see good reason to alter if we could seize and improve that instant we should effectually prevent our natural turn of temper from betraying us into sin even they who are far from governing it as they ought may be convinced of this from their own experience the most hasty spirits for example may perhaps recollect some rare occasions on which they have watched the beginnings of their anger prevented its boiling in their hearts and recovered their composure as soon it was disturbed the same care constantly employed would enable them to conquer it and preserve them from all the outrages into which it has hurried them at other times constantly to observe and correct the first tendency of the predominant passion to evil would be to kill the seeds of all its congenial vices it would be to pluck out the right eye and to cut off the right hand mat v     0   when this is neglected when the ruling passion is allowed to become in any degree irregular it works within the soul it fixes the imagination on the attractions of its object and from the contemplation of it draws nourishment and acquires strength then it struggles for exertion to prevent its exertion will require more resolute and vigorous efforts than would have been sufficient to check it before it was so far indulged but their difficulty is not greater than the necessity of employing them is urgent if selfishness has already prompted thee to devise an unrighteous plan for gratifying it and to wish for an opportunity of executing it if thine heart has already declined to the ways of a strange woman prove vii     and thou have lusted after her beauty in thine heart chap vi     if wrath has already raged like a tempest in a breast and torn thee with the desire of hurting the person who had provoked it if the gaiety of thy heart has already risen into levity ready to overleap the bounds of decency or to sport with sacred things if thy prevailing passion whatever it be has already met with inward indulgence recollect thyself immediately thou have no time to lose thou art on the brink of the precipice in one moment thou must either retreat or tumble down even after the prevailing passion has been heedlessly suffered to operate so far it may sometimes be checked and subdued by a bold and resolute effort seasonably exerted  if we can even rein in our ruling passion before it has broken out into overt acts of vice it will be of great importance for our obtaining the command of it every outward action strengthens the inward principle from which it proceeds if we indulge ourselves in vicious actions dictated by our ruling passion each of them will give it new vigor and aided by our natural proclivity to it they will quickly render it habitually vicious and almost irresistible is thy heart prone to pride high looks lofty eyes haughty words stately carriage insulting actions will render thee continually more prone to it is thy natural propensity to anger hasty words bitter taunts outrageous violence will increase the propensity but abstinence from all such evil actions as fall in with your natural temper will be the beginning of your victory over it deprived of the nourishment which it would have drawn from them it will gradually be weakened your abstinence will become continually easier and by persisting in it your temper will lose all its tendency to vice  our several passions and affections are excited by the presence or by the lively conception of their objects they are enflamed by our entertaining flattering opinions of their objects the frequent presence of these objects the dwelling upon these opinions cannot fail to strengthen our several passions and wherever the strength of a passion is faulty to render it irregular and vicious the greater our propensity to any passion the more quickly will it become irregular if therefore we would restrain our predominant passion we must be at the greatest pains to avoid the objects the opinions the imaginations which are favorable to its growth have thou a propensity to excess look not thou upon the wine when it is red when it gives his color to the cup when it moves itself aright prove xxiii     is thy constitutional bias to impurity and lust look not on a woman till thou have lusted after her mat v     do thou feel in thyself any tendency to a narrow and contracted spirit let not thy heart suggest to thee that wealth is precious let not thy fancy magnify the advantages of riches will thou set thine eyes on that which is not for riches certainly make themselves wings they flee away as an eagle toward heaven prove xxiii    would thou restrain thy ruling passion learn first to govern thy senses and thine imagination  in order to restrain our ruling passion it will often be necessary studiously to turn our attention to such objects and to accustom ourselves to such actions as are most contradictory to it art thou constitutionally gloomy turn thy thoughrs to the smiling scenes of nature the chearing views of providence and the gladdening prospects of religion art thou too much inclined to gaiety and giddiness force thyself to frequent contemplation of every thing that is awful in religion and to the frequent performance of serious exercises art thou apt to become too fond of pleasure deny thyself even such gratifications as are lawful art thou naturally indolent prescribe to thyself vigorous and continued exertion in some laudable employment when a twig has long been bent one way it cannot be made straight without being for some time bent the contrary way  the vices to which the natural temper gives us a propensity are those which we shall find the greatest difficulty in conquering and which after many defeats will most frequently revolt the last vices which a good man is able to subdue are his constitutional vices he cannot mortify them perfectly in this mortal state after all his pains they now and then prevail against him they are his frailties from the incursions of which he can never be altogether secure when peter was a young christian he betrayed the timidity of his temper by denying his lord after he had made great proficience in the christian life he withdrew from the gentile converts and separated himself fearing them which were of the circumcision gal ii     he had often in the interval displayed a noble courage but the contrary disposition had a foundation in his temper and was ready to break out on particular occasions good men fall into other sins only before a violent temptation or by being very much off their guard but the best men by the least failure in circumspection or on a very weak temptation sometimes fall into particular acts of those sins which suit their natural temper the temptation to them is ever present it lurks within it is in the heart itself we should not for this reason give indulgence to such sins or suffer ourselves to think favorably of them whenever we fall into them we should repent deeply that we may not have occasion often to repent of them we should direct our strictest attention to them and employ our most strenuous endeavors against them and thus if human infirmity permits not our avoiding them wholly render our commission of them less frequent every day a propensity to them is the weak part of the fortress it needs a double guard to preserve us from these vices is one of the chief purposes for which the grace of god is given a victory over them is one of the greatest triumphs of divine grace in the heart of man grace to conquer them should be one of the greatest subjects of our prayers and we should improve the grace of god to this purpose with the utmost diligence the generality neglect to govern their natural temper even so far as to restrain it from becoming vicious or productive of vicious actions but the government of the temper the ruling of a mans own spirit implies much more than this    it implies that every man render his temper subservient to the practice of virtue and holiness as every natural temper even the most amiable may degenerate into vice so on the contrary every temper even that which becomes most disagreeable by the smallest corruption of it may be made to contribute to the virtue of the heart to make our natural temper to contribute to this is an important part of our duty in governing it it is the business of government not only to restrain the subjects from crimes but also to encourage them in right practice and to direct and regulate their several occupations  every natural temper properly managed and improved may give us an advantage either for the practice of some particular virtue or for the general security of our virtue  some turns of temper are naturally and strongly allied to virtue it is scarcely necessary to observe because it is so plain that all the tempers which are founded in a predominance of the kind affections are directly favorable to the love of mankind to all the important virtues of benevolence and charity and render the practice of every social duty easy and pleasant or that they introduce a habit of soul congruous to the love of god as well as to that inward serenity which characterizes every grace and renders it doubly amiable  other turns of temper are as it were neutral between virtue and vice in perceiving how these may be rendered serviceable to virtue there is little difficulty the keen and eager temper in which desire is the chief ingredient when directed to holiness as its object will render a man spirited in the practice of it and susceptible of a strong impulse from its joys and rewards the contrary temper in which aversion prevails tends to cherish a deep abhorrence of sin which is one of the strongest and most permanent securities against the indulgence of it both these tempers may become equally conducive to holiness by prompting us the one to avoid evil the other to do good the temper of confidence which hope produces will encourage the heart to aspire after the most excellent seize and to attempt the most arduous improvements in virtue it seems to have been eminently the temper of the apostle paul in the school of gamaliel it led him to profit in the jews religion above many his equals in his own nation gal i     in the christian church it made him to strive that he might not be a whit behind the very chiefest apostles but in labors more abundant   cor xi       his discourse to the elders of ephesus acts xx        bears many strong marks of it in all his writings and in all his actions we may read his ambition to reach forth unto those things which are before phil iii     the opposite temper likewise of caution and timidity has so many peculiar advantages is so friendly to circumspection and watchfulness and consequently to that holiness which without these cannot be steadily and blamelessly practiced in this state of trial and difficulty that the wise man says happy is the man that fears always prove xxviii     when a cheerful heart is united to a virtuous character it favors the improvement of it it is its ornament it gives a grace to all its exertions it renders it amiable and attractive neither is the contrary temper without its own advantages when it is duly regulated it produces a seriousness in religion which is venerable and commanding and proves a preservative against many sins a high tone of the passions a sensibility ardour or activity of spirit prepares the soul for entering into the raptures of devotion for feeling the fervours of godly zeal for showing eminent alacrity in every duty this temper led john to sin on one occasion by wishing for fire from heaven to consume the samaritans luke ix     and on another occasion by intriguing for one of the chief places in the kingdom of christ mat xx    mark x     but it likewise cherished that holy vehemence in religion which entitled him to be surnamed a son of thunder mark iii     and it gave his benevolence that constant warmth that benign ardour which is conspicuous in all his writings a temper opposite to this may be improved into a settled composure and calm equability in the love and practice of holiness a resolute spirit will render it the easier to be steadfast in in our adherence to goodness a pliable and variable temper is to a certain degree requisite for our being ready to correct what we have done amiss but it is unnecessary to enter farther into particulars on this head  it is more needful to observe because it is not so obvious that even those turns of temper which are most nearly allied to vice and which are with the greatest difficulty kept from running into it may notwithstanding be rendered subservient to virtue pride for instance may be improved into true dignity of character into a noble and habitual disdain of every thought and action that is mean or base an ambitious temper needs only to be fixed upon its properest objects in order to animate us in the indefatigable pursuit of that genuine honor which results from the approbation of god and from the glories of heaven and which will be bestowed only on the righteous and in proportion to their righteousness a temper which by being neglected would become blameably selfish and contracted will by being governed become eminently conducive to prudence and an incitement to diligence in that course of holiness which is our real wisdom and our best interest even that temper in which the malevolent affections tend to preponderate the sour the morose the irascible may be rendered subservient to our virtue and improvement if it be curbed so strongly as not to lead us to hurt others or to wish for their hurt it will exert itself in a keen indignation against vice in a rigorous purity of heart in a blameless severity of manners and it will make us inaccessible to many temptations which have great power over soft and gentle and social minds  thus every temper may be rendered productive of some advantages for the practice of virtue and it is our duty to consider what are the advantages which our particular temper gives us and to improve them with care    we ought not only to render our peculiar temper subservient to virtue but also to incorporate it with all our virtues  whether a mans character be good or bad his natural temper will run through it if it be not violently hindered and will tinge it with a correspondent complexion both the particular vices to which different sinners addict themselves and the particular manners in which they practice the same vices are in a great measure determined by their different tempers the grace of god does not extinguish the diversity of tempers it only purifies and rectifies each of them there is a great variety in the make of human bodies even such as have nothing faulty or disproportioned one is formed for strength another for agility the beauty of one consists in dignity that of another in elegance there are still greater varieties in mens inward characters even when all of them are virtuous in dispositions and manners nowise blameable there may be great dissimilitude characters equally good are yet never the very same no virtue is wholly wanting in any good character but one virtue or another predominates according to the original propensity of the soul and directs and shapes the exertion of all the rest and according to the same propensity any one virtue is exercised and practiced in a different manner and style by different men survey the good characters with which you are acquainted you will find them distinguished in both these respects no two of them are perfectly alike all the good men whose lives the scripture has recorded display different forms of holiness derived from their dissimilar tempers job is characterized by patience moses by meekness david is highspirited his devotion is fervent his virtues are all heroic solomon has a softer soul turned for exercising virtue in the mild arts of peace john and paul are both warm fervent and affectionate but the warmth of the former is sweet and gentle that of the latter bold and enterprizing to the influence of the natural temper informing and fashioning the whole character and conduct are owing all the varieties of characters truly virtuous without that influence they could differ only in the degree of their goodness in all other respects they would be precisely similar  as every man thus derives from nature a distinct personal character he ought to adhere to it and to preserve its peculiar decorum he can preserve it only by maintaining his own natural temper so far as it is innocent and acting always in conformity to it we ought to comply with and follow our own particular and proper nature in the cast of our whole behavior to violate it will always be of bad consequence equability consistnce and uniformity in the whole tenor of our lives is of very great importance but it cannot be obtained if we endeavor to put on the nature of another man and to throw off our own in whatever instances we attempt it our behavior cannot be natural or graceful that will always become every man most which is most his own every departure from a mans own personal character is an affectation which will be either ridiculous or disgusting it is like the painting of the face it disguises the genuine complexion of the soul it is like altering the natural cast of the body by running into distorted attitudes and motions it is as if in ancient games the brawny wrestler had engaged only in the course and the man who was fitted for the race had endeavored to signalize himself by feats of strength a man naturally sedate and grave attempting gaiety and frolic becomes an awkward bussoon and a man naturally cheerful putting on gravity and seveverity becomes no less aukwardly morose each of them considered at one time forms a perfect contrast to himself as he appears at another time the man of a mild gentle timorous flexible spirit by choosing a walk in life which suits him will be truly amiable but should he set up for a bold reformer or intrude into a bustling sphere or rush forward into dangerous enterprises he would quickly lose himself and betray his weakness in a word as every violation of a mans peculiar temper is in its own way disagreeable ungraceful and pernicious it is an important part of the government of the temper to perform all our duties and to cultivate and exercise all our virtues in congruity to it and thus to maintain the decency of our personal and distinctive character  to conclude this subject if we would rule our own spirit if we would govern our natural temper let us restrain it from degenerating into vice or leading us into sin let us take every advantage which it can give us for the improvement of our hearts and the practice of our duty by preserving it and adhering to it so far as it is not vicious let us render our whole character natural and uniform and all our conduct graceful and consistent the means of governing our peculiar temper are the same with the means of performing every other duty resolution congruous exercises watchfulness and prayer but all these means we must in this case employ with peculiar care and diligence because it is a matter of peculiar difficulty to control and regulate our predominant disposition its importance is however in proportion to its difficulty if we can effectually accomplish this it will render it the easier to subdue all our other irregular passions they act in subordination to it and derive a great part of their strength from it and to subdue it is like cutting off the general who was the spirit of the battle and on whose fall the army breaks and takes to flight by cherishing our natural temper when refined from all perversity we shall facilitate the practice of virtue we shall render our virtues truly our own consistent becoming and graceful we shall obtain that inward tranquillity satisfaction and selfenjoyment which attends a natural state and behavior and when we are removed from this world we shall find in our fathers house mansions john xiv   peculiarly adapted to our character and shall be fit to fill our proper place in the heavenly society to the beauty perfection harmony and happiness of which a variety of characters stations and employments doubtless will contribute  sermon xii virtuous solicitude pslam cxix   o that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes a solicitude to perform our duty an anxious concern to practice holiness at all times and to make a constant progress in it is an essential ingredient in a virtuous temper a necessary qualification of our obedience and a powerful means of our becoming active and steadfast in it this solicitude is expressed strongly though in very few words in the text the nature of the psalm gives great advantage for a lively and forcible expression of it it is a pious meditation of david in which he gives utterance to the several workings of his heart in a variety of situations and particularly to his sentiments and emotions respecting the law of god in comparison with the glowing pictures of character and manners to which such a meditation gives scope general maxims delivered in a speculative discourse are cold and unaffecting it introduces us at once into the recesses of the psalmists heart it displays all the movements of his soul it enables us to perceive and makes us to feel how he thought and acted on every occasion by this means it as it were embodies a virtuous temper and while it gives us the clearest conception of the nature of holiness at the same time strikingly inculcates the love and practice of it nothing could for instance convey to us a distincter or a livelier sense of earnest solicitude to practice and improve in holiness than the warm wish which david expresses in my text o that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes this short exclamation discovers his inmost temper it shows a soul burning with love to goodness bent on the practice of it panting after improvement in it and rising in fervent prayer to god for his assistance and it expresses this temper with so great a force that we can scarcely read his wish without feeling our hearts disposed to join in it i propose to illustrate this temper by pointing out the several particulars which are implied in it    the psalmists temper implies a lively sense of the supreme importance of holiness a sense of this is the only proper foundation of solicitude to practice holiness and it is plainly expressed in the context in it the psalmist asserts the happiness of virtue blessed are the undefiled in the way who walk in the way of the lord blessed are they that keep his testimonies and that seek him with the whole heart psalm ver      he reflects that it is required by that god who has supreme authority over us thou have commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently ver    these views of holiness impressed him with such a sense of its importance as naturally dictated this earnest wish that his ways were directed to keep gods statutes and when he had formed this wish he hugged it in his very heart he exulted in the prospect of the inward peace selfcomplacence and joy which the accomplishment of it would give him and by this prospect he cherished his wish and increased its ardour then shall i not be ashamed when i have respect unto all thy commandments i will praise thee with uprightness of heart when i shall have learned thy righteous judgments ver       in whatever light we consider holiness we may well be sensible of its importance when we consider it merely in relation to the sentiments of our own hearts it is of such unspeakable consequence that if we be destitute of it if we be conscious of our having lived in the violation of its laws we cannot approve ourselves but must be ashamed and despise ourselves in every moment of serious reflection holiness is of indispensible obligation for it is the law of the god who made us the sovereign of heaven and earth it is the health of the soul the balm of adversity the ornament of prosperity the greatest good of man the happiness both of the present life and of the future the wise man estimates matters justly when he declares that to fear god and keep his commandments is the whole duty of man eccl xii      but many of us seem to form a very different judgment if we ever think of the importance of keeping gods law we think of it very seldom and very slightly the thought sinks not so deep as to touch the heart it certainly continues not so long nor recurs so often as to make a lasting impression on the heart far from regarding holiness as our chief and in comparison our only concern we seem to think it less our concern than any thing besides a moment of guilty pleasure a few pence the gratification of any appetite or passion seems to be in our opinion of greater moment than doing the will of god for it is preferred to it every day no wondr then that we are so indifferent whether we do right or wrong whether we improve or corrupt ourselves without a deep and permanent sense of the importance of virtue as our dignity our duty and our interest we cannot be solicitous to cultivate and practice it    the temper which the psalmist expresses in the text implies a settled love of goodness and hatred of iniquity this is the natural consequence of the former part of this temper a just sense of the importance of holiness cannot fail to attach our hearts to it and it will not suffer us to be cold or lukewarm in our attachment thy word says our psalmist is very pure therefore thy servant loves it i hate vain thoughts but thy law do i love my soul has kept thy testimonies and i love them exceedingly ver   0               the worst of men cannot help approving virtue and disapproving vice but the approbation and disapprobation of the wicked are only cool perceptions of the understanding in the good man these perceptions are improved into warm sentiments of the heart are made to grow up into lively affections of love and hatred a strong conception of the beauty of holiness of the excellent nature and the happy consequences of virtue enamours his soul and makes him to feel all that david felt when he said o how love i thy law it is my meditation all the day how sweet are thy words unto my taste yea sweeter than honey to my mouth through thy precepts i get understanding therefore i hate every false way therefore i love thy commandments above gold yea above fine gold therefore i esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right and i hate every false way ver     0   0           hatred of sin is inseparable from the love of holiness it is its counterpart it is a different exertion of the very same affection the more warmly we are affected by the excellence of virtue the stronger sense we must have of the baseness of vice the greater must be our abhorrence of it the keener our indignation against it a strong affection to any object always implies aversion to its contrary if virtue be the darling of the heart vice must be its detestation  these principles rooted and cherished in the soul will necessarily promote virtuous solicitude actuated by them we cannot but regret deeply every failure in our duty every stain and depravity of our temper we must long for deliverance from every remain of the body of sin we must be intent upon holiness and fired with a noble ardour in the practice of it    this leads us on to observe that the temper expressed in the text includes a vigorous constant and prevailing desire to keep gods statutes this is indeed the leading feature in that temper it is the most obvious language of davids wish it will naturally spring from a sense of the importance of holiness and from love to it on account of its importance and it is only when it springs from these that it can have either vigor or stability when a wish that we were holy springs up suddenly as is too often the case only from an occasional fit of seriousness from accidental experience of some of the inconveniences of our vices from the present depression of adversity or from a momentary dread of the wrath of god as from a seed dropped by chance in an improper or unprepared soil no wonder that it is weak and puny and quickly withers for it has no sound and healthy root it must grow out of a warm love to goodness else it cannot thrive that it may thrive and yield its proper fruits it must be both strong and constant  rare and transient wishes for holiness however ardent will be of small avail there are few of us perhaps who do not sometimes wish and wish earnestly too that we were better than we are it is only the sinner who is abandoned in his way that never forms this wish it now and then starts up in the thoughtless sons of pleasure in the midst of their dissipation though it stays not long enough to preserve them from going again into the house of a strange woman prove vii      or from seeking for mixed wine chap xxii  0  on the next occasion it sometimes steals into the heart of the busy worldling though the cares of life banish it before it can excite him to labor strenuously for the meat which endures unto everlasting life john vi     sinners of every class cannot help sometimes wishing their own souls know it sor deliverance from the power of sin nay all who have not proceeded far and persisted long in sin are at times wung with anguish and in the bitterness of their souls groan heavily for reformation but all their wishes and their groans are useless because they are not permanent and habitual  on the other hand our desires of virtue and improvement will not be sufficient though they be constant if they are not likewise strong a man may feel pretty constantly a faint desire of doing good but because it is faint it is therefore ineffectual we sometimes feel such a desire even while we are committing sin at the very time when opportunity invites when temptation solicits when appetite or passion prompts to an act of sin we yet do not run into it with full complacence there are desires and wishes on the other side they struggle against the commission of the sin but they are vanquished by the superior strength of sinsul inclination yet they do not yield in silence they complain as it were of the violence which they suffer they make us to feel great reluctance against the sin even while they yield when the act of sin is over the virtuous desires revive we are pierced with grief we wish that we had not done it we wish and pray that we may be more resolute hereafter but corrupt inclination soon begins again to rise it struggles against the nobler wish for virtue these opposite desires possess the heart by turns they sometimes even occupy it together and distract it but on a new trial the vicious desire puts forth all its strength the virtuous wish is overwhelmed in every trial it fails for it has not vigor enough to actuate us uniformly in opposition to vicious principles  davids concern to practice and improve in holiness was at once vigorous and steady he explicitly declares both its vehemence and its constancy behold i have longed after thy precepts my soul breaks for the longing that it has unto thy judgments at all times i opened my mouth and panted for i longed for thy commandments ver  0  0      our desires of virtue should have so great life as to be able constantly to support themselves against all opposition and to exert themselves in spite of every difficulty blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness mat v    the appetites of hunger and thirst will be satisfied with nothing but meat and drink and they crave always till they gt them just so our desire to keep gods law ought to be such as will be satisfied with nothing less than actually keeping it and such as will make our endeavors restless and indefatigable till we be conscious that we have kept it    the temper of solicitude to keep gods statutes which david expresses in the text implies a firm resolution to keep them that he was resolved he tlls us explicitly when he says almost immediately after i will keep thy statutes ver    i have chosen the way of truth i will keep thy precepts with my whole heart ver  0     throughout the psalm he repeatedly declares his resolution in a great variety of terms the desire of being virtuous naturally produces a resolution to practice virtue and by this resolution the desire is in its turn confirmed  we do not sincerely desire a thing at most our desire of it is very weak if we at the same time resolve not to do any thing for obtaining it a strong desire of what in any measure depends upon our own endeavors quickly converts itself into a resolution to pursue it the desire is the resolution in its beginning the resolution is the desire risen to maturity when even transient wishes that they were better men are accidentally excited in the wicked they always produce at least for a moment some design of becoming better men the design proves abortive because the wishes were only transient but were we earnestly and habitually desirous of becoming holy we would be likewise sincerely and constantly determined to practice holiness without a resolution to do all we can to keep gods statutes an ardent desire to keep them would be an absolute absurdity  as soon as the resolution is formed it supports and strengthens the desire it presents the object of the desire in a new form fit to draw out that desire with redoubled force it sets it before us as what we have resolved that we will by any means obtain i have said that i would keep thy words i have sworn and i will perform it that i will keep thy righteous judgments ver     0   the psalmists prayer in the text expresses a soul already resolved to practice virtue and in consequence of this concerned and solicitous to execute the resolution his resolution was hearty and permanent and therefore his solicitude was vehement and lasting but too often our resolutions are neither vigorous nor habitual and our solicitude must partake in their infirmity and languor when a favorable opportunity of committing some darling sin occurs when a strong temptation to it presents itself we discover that we have never made a determined choice of the ways of virtue that we have been but half resolved to walk in them that resolution has never taken fast hold of us for if our resolution be at all remembered in the hour of difficulty we find it feeble and impotent it suffers itself to be explained away we persuade ourselves that it was not necessary to have formed it with so great rigor and severity and that in this instance we may venture to counteract it enervated by these suggestions of corrupt passion our good resolutions yield they vanish and with them vanishes every desire to do our duty this desire is again awakened our resolutions are renewed and renewed still again but still again they fail and are forgotten in the day of trial such fluctuation makes it plain that our resolution was not firm it sprang not from a stable love of goodness nor from a predominant desire to practice it and for that reason it begets no solicitude to carry it into execution a hearty resolution would be an unalterable choice of gods testimonies as our employment and our heritage for ever ver         the psalmists temper which we are describing implies a prevailing bias of the whole soul toward virtuous practice he declares explicitly that this was included in his temper i have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes always even unto the end ver      it is not enough that the will be fixed in a determination to practice holiness the whole heart likewise all the affections and springs of action must acquire a continual bent and tendency toward the practice of it till they have acquired this bent our desire of practicing holiness cannot settle into an uninterrupted solicitude but must often fail of producing its effect the inclination of the heart to virtue arises partly from the reduction of vicious passions and partly from the vigor of good affections  while vicious passions retain so great a strength as to render us often violently prone to sin they will often likewise make us to look upon our duty with aversion or regret they will extinguish for a time the desire of performing it even though we be determined to perform it and in the place of that desire they will inspire wishes that we could in this instance dispense with obedience to the law of god few of us i fear have made so great a progress in virtue as not sometimes to feel corrupt inclination struggling in this manner against our best principles and resolutions we are perhaps determined not to indulge it but it is so strong that it almost overcomes us it is by a sort of force that principle and resolution restrain us unwilling and reluctant from proceeding to the full indulgence of it it is well if they restrain us by any means god knows that in many cases they cannot but their needing to restrain us by force by so violent an exertion of their power is a proof of the imperfection of our holiness our heart is not yet enough formed to virtue else inful passion could not resist so stoutly indeed in this frail and feeble state irregular appetites and passions cannot be totally extirpated solicited by the presence or the conception of their object they will sometimes rise and labor for indulgence but in the person who is resolved and solicitous to adhere to virtue and habitually actuated by this resolution and solicitude irregular inclinations will be so often chckd and so much accustomed to submit that whenever the virtuous principle begins to exert itself they will after a few languid efforts yield without great reluctance in like manner as the most mttlesome horse by being nured to the bit readily obeys the gentlest motion of the skilful rider  at the same time all virtuous affections being nourished by the determined choice and love of the heart and strengthened by habitual practice consequent there upon will be rendered sensible as it were of their title to indulgence will rise with considence will be in a constant preparation and forwardness to exert themselves and will exert themselves with alertness and vigor whenever they have opportunity thus ardent desire of virtue cherished by love to it and supported by a steady resolution to practice it will gradually produce a propensity to virtue wear off the contrary bias of depraved nature and impress a predominant bent and tendency to run into the practice of every duty and by this bent and tendency the desire of virtue and improvement will be strengthened and secured of its accomplishment for it will be rendered natural and congruous to the reigning temper of the soul    finally the temper which the psalmist here expresses implies fervent desire o gods assistance in the practice of holiness he addresses his wish in a prayer to god and in many passages of the psalm with declarations of his solicitude to do his duty he joins petitions for aid from god in doing it i will keep thy statutes o forsake me not utterly teach me o lord the way of thy statutes and i shall keep it unto the end make me to go in the path of thy commandments for therein do i delight incline my heart unto thy testimonies and not to covetousness behold i have longed after thy precepts quicken me in thy righteousness consider how i love thy precepts quicken me o lord according to thy loving kindness let thine hand help me for i have chosen thy precepts ver             0           the weakness and the corruption of our nature render the assistance of god absolutely necessary for our practicing holiness a sense of necessity is sufficient to produce ardent desires of that assistance and earnest wishes for it in every person who regards and is attached to holiness as his main concern had we indeed no hope of obtaining it our wishes must be weak and transient desire vanishes when we know it to be impossible that it should be fulfilled it soon becomes languid when its accomplishment appears to be totally uncertain but desire is supported and invigorated by the prospect of its being satisfied of assistance from the benignity of god in practicing that holiness which is his delight nature itself infuses some degree of hope and revelation gives us full assurances if then we be not constantly concerned to obtain it we cannot be sensible of the infinite importance of holiness we can have no love to it we can have neither desire nor resolution to adhere to it we cannot have the smallest inclinaion of heart to the practice of it this temper would impel us with an irresistible force to ask the aids of divine grace it would not suffer us at any time to ask them without a real desire of them in our hearts it would not suffer us to ask them with only weak desires it would not suffer us to continue long without exerting desires of them it would render our concern to be assisted and strengthened by god constant and habitual we stand in need of his assistance for doing every action of our lives in a right manner let us not at the time of any action be void of the desire of his assistance in particular whenever we find either a temptation or an inclination to any sin whenever we meet with any difficulty in perceiving or adhering to our duty let us then recollect ourselves and cherish and put forth desire of aid from heaven let us diligently use all means of religious worship and meditation which god has appointed for the communication of his grace to men and whenever we use them let it not be with indifference let it be with fervent desires of obtaining by them the influence of divine grace the grace of god alone  keep alive our solicitude to do his will and preserve it in continual vigor and as the tree naturally draws in the sap which conduces to its life and growth that solicitude will foster earnest and habitual dsires of his grace to enable us to do his will  thus the psalmists prayer in the text is a fervent expression of his solicitude to practice and improve in holiness it displays a soul possessed with a deep sense of the supreme importance of holiness with a prevailing love to it with strong and constant desires of it resolved firmly to adhere to it habitually prone and welldisposed to its several duties and earnest to obtain all that assistance from god which is necessary for holding up our goings in his ways psalm xvii    these are the sentiments and dispositions which by their union form that concern and solicitude to become holy which ought to actuate us uniformly which is an essential ingredient in a virtuous temper and which will be one of the most powerful incitements to the cultivation of it in every person who is not wholly destitute of holiness some degree of this solicitude must take place no man can practice holiness whose heart is not set upon it as his business the best of us are defective in virtuous solicitude and therefore our holiness is so incomplete a just and permanent concern to be better would quickly carry us forward to the perfection of goodness  that you may understand this holy solicitude still more clearly that you may judge the more certainly whether you are actuated by it that you may have the stronger sense of its moment and utility i shall conclude this discourse with pointing out what sort of conduct and behavior will naturally result from the inward temper which we have described is it not plain that the man whose soul is full of love to virtue and resolved anxious and inclined to practice it and excel in it as long as he acts under the influence of this temper will be indefatigable in studying his duty and careful diligent inflexible in doing what he knows to be his duty does not ardour in every art prompt the artist to become perfect both in the knowledge of its principles and in performing according to its rules and can it be otherwise in the art of life  in every situation that mans concern who glows with virtuous ardour will be not what is agreeable to his humor and inclination and what will procure him pleasure or advantage but solely what is right and good intent on discovering this he will like david meditate on gods precepts and hide gods word in his heart that he may not sin against him his testimonies also will be his delight and his only counselors ver           except we know our duty it is impossible that we practice it if we willingly remain ignorant of it we are indifferent about it  when desire love resolution and inclination are all fixed upon holiness the united force of these cannot fail to render a man diligent in practicing it he will abstain from every sin for that holiness on which his heart is set includes universal purity we commit sin only because we are not enough solicitous to avoid it they who seek opportunities of sinning who designedly meet temptations or who yield without a struggle on their first assault show that they are wholly destitute of virtuous solicitude nay under the power of a contrary temper prone to sin in love with it confirmed in iniquity temptations will often force themselves upon us if in this case we yield to them easily or deliberate about yielding to them or admit in our hearts any extenuations of the sin or faulter in our resistance to it this manifestly proceeds from some coldness in our love of virtue some weakness in our resolution to pursue it some faintness in our desire of practicing it some remaining indisposition of our hearts to virtue the man who is intent on virtue will be watchful against every deviation from it the infirmity of his nature will not allow him to avoid every act of sin but his inward temper will make him restless till he recover himself by repentance and fortify his soul more strongly against a relapse a sudden temptation may now and then surprise him off his guard but for the most part the aversion of his determined heart against sin will be roused quickly enough to defend him even from a sudden assault corrupt appetite and passion like a reduced enemy deriving unnatural strength from a fit of despair may at times exert such force as to gain an advantage over him but they will never be able to bring him into lasting subjection fixed on the attainment of holiness he will war constantly against all its enemies till he subdue them though it should be by slow degrees and by means of the severest struggles he will practice and cultivate every virtue for every virtue belongs to that holy temper which engages his most earnest solicitude omissions of his duty neglects of the virtuous exertions for which he has opportunity will be the rare blemishes of his conduct not its general tenor or complexion the temper of his soul will produce activity in well doing will render him resolute patient and undaunted in surmounting all the difficulties of religion will prompt him to put forth all his strength that he may be ever pure blameless and eminently good in proportion as our solicitude for virtue renders it our prevailing temper every duty will become pleasant to us by falling in with the predominant bent of our hearts and we shall perform it with alacrity and cheerfulness its very difficulties will only occasion an agreeable exertion of vigor even the pains which it brings upon us will be amply compensated by the gratification which the performance of it yields to our prevailing temper and we shall constantly delight ourselves in gods commandments which we have loved ver      o that our ways were directed thus to keep gods statutes  amen sermon xiii regard to positive institutions essential to goodness of character luke i   and they were both righteous before god walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the lord blameless in these words which contain the character given by the evangelist of the parents of john the baptist the moral precepts of the law are by many thoughts to be meant by ordinances and the positive and ritual precepts by commandmets and in respect of both zacharias and elizabeth are pronounced righteous before god and blameless in the sight of men in this light the words intimate that a regard to ritual duties really instituted by god as well as to moral virtue is necessary to a worthy and blameless character but though the expressions should not be considered as intended to mark this distinction it being certain that they are often used promiscuously in scripture yet the text will naturally enough suggest the same intimation for none who attends to the nature of the mosaical dispensation abounding with ceremonies appointed by the immediate authority of god can imagine that a jew and a jewish priest would have been respected as bearing a blameless character without the punctual observance of all the ritual duties of his religion  that moral duties are the weightier matters of the law mat xxiii     and of higher and more indispensible obligation than any positive and external duty none but the superstitious will deny it is so plain and so certain a truth that even the superstitious generally rather act in contradiction to it than explicitly deny it but on this obvious and important truth error may be grafted by this principle some who profess to believe the gospel think themselves authorized to pronounce that a regard to external worship and ritual duties is not at all essential to a good and worthy character and to bestow the highest applause on persons whose benevolence and moral integrity they reckon unexceptionable without any abatement for their totally neglecting all the positive appointments of christianity nay a punctual observance of these they would perhaps consider as taking something from the character as implying weakness and superstition if not hypocrisy this judgment is pronounced by such persons as think themselves at liberty to neglect positive duties provided they adhere to moral virtue the principles of conduct which we adopt for ourselves always influence our sentiments of others  in consequence of the influence of opposite principles of conduct the generality of christians form a very different judgment i speak not of the superstitious who despise morality and foolishly rest in outward rites as the whole of religion it is natural for them to reckon a scrupulous observance of rites a compensation for moral goodness in other men as well as in themselves but even they whom all except the impious will acquit from the charge of superstition they who both in principle and in practice acknowledge the great superiority of moral to positive duties but yet esteem these latter also of high obligation nay all who have a genuine and deep sense of religion not only judge a regard to its positive institutions absolutely necessary to complete a worthy character but even pass a severer censure on a total disregard to these or a very great neglect of them than on some transgressions of moral obligation and reckon it a more certain sign of an unprincipled and graceless character  this judgment seems at first sight to be inconsistent with the acknowledged preference due to moral duties the unbelieving and ungodly ascribe it without hesitation to superstition and as it is adopted by serious christians in general and even supported by the declarations of scripture and the spirit of revealed religion they considently urge it as a proof that revealed religion and positive precepts necessarily foster superstition and lead men to undervalue morality it will be useful therefore to account for this judgment without resolving it into superstition to show that it is just and well founded and perfectly consistent with the superiority of moral virtue to all positive duties to evince that notwithstanding this superiority a great neglect of the latter is really baser and more blameable than some defects in the former it will tend to invalidate a plausible objection against the genius and consequently the divinity of christianity and to correct sentiments which many christians have especially in this age heedlessly borrowed from infidelity with a view to these important purposes i shall in the present discourse endeaour to prove that a total disregard to the positive and external duties of religion or a very great neglect of them is justly reckoned more blameable and a stronger evidence of an unprincipled character than even some transgressions of moral obligation and afterward i shall apply the subject to the direction of our practice  i begin with observing that positive institutions in general as distinguished from particular rites have really the nature of moral commandments no one particular mode of external worship is of moral obligation but to worship god externally is a duty of moral obligation suitable to our compound frame and our embodied state and so obviously discernible by the light of nature that it has been acknowledged by the universal practice of mankind in every age and every nation but the man who totally and constantly neglects positive duties does not at all worship god externally and consequently transgresses a moral obligation and is justly cnsurable as in that respect immoral and vicious  besides even particular positive precepts as soon as they are given by god have something moral in their nature suppose the ites which are enjoined by them perfectly indifferent before they were enjoined yet from that moment they cease to be indifferent the divine authority is interposed for the observance of them to neglect them is no longer to forbear an indifferent action or to do a thing in one way rather than in another which has naturally no greater propriety it is very different it is to disobey god it is to despise his authority it is to resist his will can any man believe a god and not acknowledge that disobedience to him and contempt of his authority is immoral and far from the least heinous species of immorality to condemn the person therefore who neglects the external worship of god and the positive institutions of his will and to condemn him for this neglect more severely than for some other vices is not weakness is not superstition is not to give rites the preference to moral virtue it is only to proportion our sentiments to the comparative moment of different moral virtues it is only to pronounce that obedience to the great lawgiver of the universe is a very sacred and important virtue it is only to judge consistently with the belief of a god  to render this still plainer it may be observed that positive duties are expressions of affections and dispositions morally good the heart is the seat both of virtue and of vice but every virtue and every vice seated in the heart necessarily exerts itself in correspondent outward actions we perceive only these actions from them we infer the virtue or vice of the heart and we bestow upon the character a degree of approbation or of disapprobation suited to the virtue or the vice which we have found reason to infer our exact observance of positive rites owned by us to be of divine appointment shows in general a temper of subjection and obedience to god the neglect of such rites shows the want or the weakness of this temper every particular religious rite is fit also for expressing some particular good affection thanksgiving is an exertion of gratitude prayer of dependence intercession of benevolence and if the good affection be vigorous in the heart it will break forth into such exertion the neglect therefore of all external worship and positive duties indicates the want and great remissness in them proclaims the weakness of all the good affections which would have been exercised in performing them and the man who indulges himself in that remissness or neglect we with reason consider as void of these affections they are among the most amiable affections in human nature they stand in opposition to the most detestable vices on the person therefore who either by his neglect of the positive institutions and external duties of religion or by any other means shows himself to be destitute of these affections not to pass a heavy censure would demonstrate a great perversion of judgment for to be destitute of these affections is a deeper depravity than that which is fixed upon the character by some immediate transgressions of moral laws when we censure it more severely than such transgressions we only look beyond the outward action which indicates it and which is neither good nor evil considered merely in itself we abstract from such circumstances of the action as are not essential we consider it simply as a sign of inward moral temper and we estimate the character according to that inward temper which alone can be of importance in determining it  farther all positive institutions of divine appointment are means of cultivating moral virtue be the rites themselves what they will their being enjoined by god renders them proper trials of our obedience to him and renders our observance of them the means of cherishing a sense of his authority and of improving a principle of subjection to it a principle of subjection to the authority of god is one of the firmest supports of all goodness and virtue and positive institutions are the most direct means of cultivating it for the observance of them proceeds solely from the principle of obedience but in every moral virtue other principles are conjoined with this all the rites appointed by god are likewise direct and very powerful means of improving many particular virtuous affections all the affections which are naturally exercised in performing them neglect of the means demonstrates in every case indifference about the end disregard to external worship and positive institutions shows the want of all concern for moral improvement but unconcernedness for moral improvement is not the defect of a single virtue is not a single vice it is a corruption and degeneracy of the whole soul and therefore must appear highly detestable to every person of sound and unbiassed judgment much more highly detestable than some transgressions of a single moral law  again when men indulge themselves in the neglect of positive duties their acts of neglect are more frequent more constant and bear a greater proportion to their acts of performance than the acts of immediate immorality which even in very vicious persons fall under the notice of observers but it is unquestionably just to pass a severer censure on a long and uninterrupted multitude of transgressions though each of them taken by itself be not very einous than on a few acts of vice each of which singly is greater than any one of the others this consideration actually has great influence on the judgment now under examination for on the one hand it is only the total or the very great neglect of positive institutions that men pronounce inconsistent with all principle and goodness smaller degrees of neglect we treat with greater indulgence than almost any immediate transgression of moral law and on the other hand when a man lives in the frequent or the continual practice of any direct immorality we consider him as abandoned to that vice and never fail to blame his conduct more highly than we blame any neglect of positive institutions  it must be added that the neglect of positive duties is more obvious to spectators than many transgressions of moral obligation these latter are sometimes indefinite and ambiguous the actions from which we infer a transgression are in some degree equivocal and capable of different constructions but the neglect of a positive institution is an act absolutely determinate which can neither be palliated nor explained away men therefore pass their censure upon it without hesitation and the assurance and readiness with which they pass itgives their judgment greater firmness and force and more appearance of severity than the judgments have which they pronounce with hesitation concerning transgressions of moral obligation more indeterminate or equivocal  finally with respect to almost every transgression of moral obligation there is some natural passion which directly and universally proves a temptation to it we of course think of this temptation along with the transgression and a sense of its strength and of the difficulty of resisting it mitigates our censure any vicious passion may accidentally and in a particular instance oppose the observance of a positive institution but there is no one natural passion which stands directly and in all cases in opposition to the performance of positive duties consequently there is no universal temptation to the total or habitual neglect of them in the view of mankind when they pass their censure on the person who indulges himself in that neglect and therefore they pass it without mitigation or abatement  these considerations duly weighed will be sufficient to vindicate the severe judgment passed by the bulk of christians concerning the character of those persons who habitually or totally disregard the positive institutions of religion this judgment is perfectly consistent with a sense of the superior excellence of moral virtue it by no means implies that mere rites and ceremonies are in any case so essential as moral goodness it only considers a disregard to rites ordained by god as a proof of moral defect or depravity and condemns it more severely than smaller defects or depravitis evidenced by actions of a different kind this judgment proceeds not from superstition it is founded in nature it is confirmed by the clearest principles of sound reason it is not they who reckon a regard to positive institutions essential to a good and unblemished character that judge weakly but they who reckon that regard of no importance vain are their pretensions to enlargement of sentiment and elevation above prejudice their minds are so contracted that they can admit only a partial idea of the nature of positive duties they consider but the mere matter of them they comprehend not their moral principles their sublime end or their important signification suffer not yourselves christians to adopt or to give any countenance to a judgment which cannot be supported without supposing either that the ritual institutions of your religion are not of divine original or that the precepts of your god are not of sacred obligation your religion does bind you to hold the contrary judgment and in doing so it perfectly coincides with reason it fosters not superstition it prohibits irreligion it sets not morality aside but it completes it and makes a provision for its support absolutely necessary in our present embodied state the high regard which christianity demands to external worship can be no presumption that it is an imposture on the contrary its entire coincidence with reason in demanding this regard consistently with the acknowledged superiority of moral virtue and even in subservience to it is a mark of its descent from that god who endued men with reason  the observations which we have made in this discourse tend no less to direct our practice than to regulate our judgment with respect to the moral and the positive precepts of religion they serve to restrain us from both the extremes to which mankind have always shown a propensity  they warn us on the one hand against indulging ourselves in the neglect of the positive appointments of christianity under a pretense of adhering solely to morality they demonstrate this neglect so incompatible with the whole tenor of the gospel to be on supposition of the truth of the gospel no less incompatible with reason and a heinous violation of morality itself moral duties are far more excellent than positive whenever in a particular situation we cannot perform both unquestionably we ought to prefer the former but whenever there is no such inconsistence it is equally unquestionable that the obligation of the latter is sacred and indispensible such inconsistence is very rare how seldom does our situation enable us honestly to say that we could not have attended upon external worship without neglecting some moral duty how seldom is the superiority of virtue to external rites at all applicable to our situation or capable of being pleaded as an excuse for our omitting these the omission generally proceeds from very dissimilar causes from insensibility to the authority of gods laws from weakness of the religious affections from indifference about spiritual improvement indifference about improvement in that very morality for which we pretend so ardent a zeal no doubt there may be just reasons for omitting a positive duty at a particular time but what then will this excuse our omitting it when there is no just reason there may be reasons also for omitting a particular exercise of moral virtue peculiar circumstances may make that cease to be our duty at one time which is our duty at other times will it therefore follow that moral virtue may be neglected when no such peculiar circumstances exist in the former case it is as really as in the latter a point of conscience whether the reasons which actually move us to the omission are just and valid for the frequent omission of positive duties much more for the habitual and constant neglect of them there cannot possibly be any just or valid reason it is absolutely inexcusable it is inconsistent with the belief of the gospel  but let us be likewise careful to guard against the opposite extreme while we shun irreligion let us with equal caution avoid superstition though a regard to positive duties be necessary for completing a worthy character yet a regard to them alone will contribute very little to worthiness of character to perform them without a religious temper is base hypocrisy to perform them without moral improvement is unprofitable superstition to reckon the performance of them a compensation for the neglect of any virtue an atonement for any vice is destructive imprety all the principles from which we have been reasoning imply the superiority of moral virtue it is from the indispensible obligation and the excellence of this that we have deduced all our proofs of the sacred obligation of positive institutions as they who disregard these neglect the necessary means and the natural expressions of religion so they who rest in them despise its principle and its substance while we are not negligent in observing any institution of our religion let us be diligent in practicing every virtue  religion is of a complex nature it includes things of different kinds it includes articles of faith and rules of practice it includes precepts of a moral and precepts of a positive kind all these are essential to it and each of them has its proper place and dignity we ought not to separate them we ought not unduly to exalt one and depress the rest the pharisees in our saviors time undervalued and neglected moral duties and hoped to expiate the neglect by a very scrupulous compliance not only with positive precepts of divine appointment but also with superstitions of their own invention for this our savior often reproved them with great severity the contrary extreme he had scarcely an opportunity of reproving professedly none of the jews imagined it lawful to neglect the ritual of their religion it is among christians that this inconsistent absurdity has been introduced by the contagion of infidelity yet in reproving the pharisees he has sufficiently put us on our guard against this extreme while he declares the superior excellence of moral virtue and inculcates the careful practice of it as indispensible he is far from vilifying positive duties of gods appointment he inculates the observance of them also as truly necessary he distinguishes the respective obligations of these two classes with the utmost accuracy woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye pay tithes of mint and anise and cummin and rue and all manner of herbs and have omitted the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and faith and the love of god these ought you to have done and not to leave the other undone mat xxiii    luke xi     neither part of the injunction is unnecessary in the christian world neither part of it can be disregarded without hazard to our souls if we walk not both in all the commandments and in all the ordinances of the lord if we perform not both moral and positive duties in their proper places we cannot sustain a character of complete and consistent worth we can neither be rightecus before god nor blameless in the eyes of such men as judge soundly and impartially  sermon xiv redeeming the time preached in the beginning of the year ephesians v    redeeming the time  it is the prerogative of mans reasonable nature to be capable of looking backward to the past and forward to the future it is this capacity that qualifies us for forming some judgment of the future and for directing our conduct in it by the experience which we have acquired in time past our acting this part is absolutely necessary for the prudent management of our worldly business it is equally necessary in religion and as subservient to religious prudence it is incomparably more important because religion is our principal concern  to reflect on the past part of our lives extending our thoughts at the same time to the future part of them and from that reflection to collect maxims for the regulation of our future conduct is a very powerful means of religious improvement it is to redeem the time that we may walk circumspectly not as sools but as wise it is an exercise which we ought to perform frequently but which we are very apt to neglect for preventing the neglect we should take advantage of the several distinctions of time and at the end of each of them recollect our demeanor through the course of it for our direction in the next it is an excellent advice to this purpose which an ancient philosopher gave to his scholars at the end of every day to recollect all the actions of it that if they had done any thing amiss they might amend it next day and that if they had done any thing well they might enjoy the comfort of it when a heathen recommended this to be practiced every day may not they blush to call themselves christians who practice it scarcely any day such daily recollection uniformly persisted in could not fail to produce the happiest effects a little time only could indeed by the generality be bestowed upon it every day but if it were practiced every day a very little time would soon become sufficient for it even in this case however it would not be superfluous at the end of larger periods of our time particularly of the years which divide our lives to survey at greater leisure the manner in which we have employed them to consider more deliberately how we may render the occurrences of them subservient to our improvement and to resolve more explicitly that we will render them subservient to it but the more negligent we have been in daily recollection the more necessary it is that we should deliberately reflect upon our conduct at stated times  one year is just expired only a few days of another year are yet elapsed if we have begun this year with the practice now mentioned it is well if we have not it is not yet too late we are yet alive though even in these few days many of our fellowmen and some it may be of our neighbors have been snatched away by death let us seize the opportunity while we have it how soon it may be lost god only knows while we yet live let us look back upon our past conduct that we may learn to redeem the time thus the apostle exhorted the ephesians and thus he exhorts every one of us the ephesians had but lately heard the gospel preached having for the greatest part of their lives been heathens dead in trespasses and sins wherein they walked according to the course of this world chap ii      the apostle considers all that part of their lives as lost and directs them to redeem it to buy it back though we were born christians we also have lost a great part of our past time having a name that we lived we have been dead rev iii    let us too buy back our time  there is a sense in which every man would gladly buy back his past time when old age has come upon us when feebleness has run through our frame when disease racks us who would not willingly recover the season of youth health and vigor the sensualist when pleasure begins to lose its relish or when he can no longer find opportunity and means of gratification wishes that he could recall the opportunities and the enjoyments which he once had and taste his sensuality anew the worldling would rejoice if he could recall his former opportunities of making gain the sorrowful and the unsuccessful periods of life we would readily abandon but all the hours which have been cheerful prosperous or successful we would be desirous of redeeming and living over again in such ways to redeem the time would be only to have it in our power again to misspend it or at best to employ it for mere worldly purposes to redeem it in such ways is impossible time once past is irrecoverable the very latest moments of the last year and of yesterday are already as much beyond our reach as the years and days which were before the flood the only way in which we can redeem the time is to employ the future better than we have employed the past it is from the experience of the past to learn to act more wisely for the time to come correcting the faults which we have formerly committed pursuing the improvements which we have hitherto neglected and using the opportunities which we have often carelessly let slip  for our thus redeeming the time it is necessary to look back to the past with a resolution to apply it to the direction of the future that we therefore may thus redeem the time let us in the beginning of this year review our past time and particularly our past year on purpose to learn how we may make a better use of our time in the present year and in all our future years that we may review it with the greater distinctness and with the greater advantage let us consider our past time  first in respect of itself  secondly in respect of the events which it brought along with it and  thidly in respect of the manner in which we have employed it  first let us consider our past time in respect of itself  time considered simply in itself is a trust committed to us by god and it is a most important trust and committed to us for the most important of all purposes for providing for eternity for avoiding the misery of hell and for obtaining the everlasting joys of heaven our time is short it is likewise so uncertain that we know not but it may expire in a single hour its shortness and uncertainty render it a trust the more important for still it is the only season allowed us for securing our everlasting interests being so important time ought not to be wasted whenever the care of our souls is neglected time is wasted about whatever else it has been employed pleasure is alluring innocent pleasure we are not required to refuse riches are convenient by honest means we are allowed to pursue them honor and power are desirable we are not forbidden to aspire after them with moderation but in the pursuit neither of pleasure nor of riches nor of power and honor ought our whole time to be employed it ought to be employed chiefly in seeking after the delights the treasures the dignities the glories of immortality  to which of these pursuits has your past time to which of them has your last year been devoted examine this question seriously it is a very serious inquiry and it is each of you for himself that can determine it  does conscience testify that your past time that your last year has been devoted to the care of your souls has been employed for their salvation has contributed to their improvement in goodness happy may you with reason be in the pleasing consciousness you have no need to redeem the time you have spent it well continue to do so spend this year as you did the last spend it as much better as you can if you do not you will nceforth lose your time and forfit all the advantage which you have gained the whole of this life is the day allotted us for our preparation for eternity as long as the day lasts w must work the works of him that sent us john ix    then when the night comes we shall fall asleep in christ   cor xv     we shall est from our labors our works shall follow us rev xiv     and spring up into everlasting blessedness  but does any of you after careful selfexamination find that your last year has not promoted your salvation that it has been spent in sin that it is gone without bringing you to repentance which of you have reason to form this melancholy judgment concerning yourselves it is impossible for me to say but in so numerous an assembly there must be many who have reason to form it and who deceive themselves if they form it not you have lost your precious time redeem it without delay begin immediately to work out your salvation phil ii     employ this year in working it out with diligence to lose any longer time would be desperate folly the night comes wherein no man can work john ix    you know not how soon it comes the day of human life is not like the natural day of a known and equable duration there are clouds which unexpectedly overcast the sunshine of life and often bring on night and darkness at noon give glory therefore to the lord your god before he cause darkness and before your seet stumble upon the dark mountains and while ye look for light he turn it into the shadow of death and make it gross darkness jer xiii      seconldy let us consider our past time in respect of the events which it brought along with it time brings along with it opportunities and it brings along wiah it temptations to these two all possible vents may be reduced in relation to their influence on our behavior and our state    every portion of time brings valuable opportunities along with it your last year brought you many opportunities every hour gives an opportunity for the practice of some christian duty for some act of selfgovernment for some exercise of piety or for some work of beneficence how many such opportunities has the last year presented to every one of us recollect them carefully ponder them attentively every one of our opportunities has been either improved or neglected the only portions of our time which we have no need to redeem are those whose opportunities we have improved the remembrance of them will elevate our hearts with spiritual joy and with triumphant hope may they be many of which we can have this glad remembrance it will give us the sincerest the purest the most solid happiness of which a mortal man is capable let our blessed experience of it in any past instance encourage us to seize and to improve our future opportunities with still greater alacrity and assiduity that our joy may grow that our joy may be full then shall we employ all the coming days of our lives continually better and better ever abounding in the work of the lord   cor xv     herein shall our father be glorified john xv    and hereby great shall be our reward in heaven mat v      but alas who among us can survey his past life who among us can survey a single year nay a single day of it and say with truth that we have laid hold of all the opportunities of doing our duty of improving ourselves in holiness of fitting ourselves for heaven which it put into our hands many very many of those talents which our lord has delivered to us each of us has neglected to employ to advantage we have laid them up in a napkin luk xix  0  we have hid them in the earth mat xxv     we have suffered them to remain useless we have even lost them of all this we must give an account to our lord at his return for all this let us now call ourselves to an account that judging ourselves we may not be judged by him   cor xi     the best of us have let many an opportunity slip redeem the opportunity so the text may be translated and so it is understood by several interpreters reflect what are the opportunities which you have lost by what means you were led to lose them and in what manner you might have improved them guard against similar neglects for the future look out hereafter for every opportunity of welldoing that you may seize it the moment it occurs though you should not be so negligent of your opportunities as to prevent your salvation yet every degree of negligence will lessen your reward the servant who had gained only five pounds was set over only five cities but he who had gained ten pounds was raised to authority over ten cities luke xix        some of us i fear like the thoughtless spendthrift who dissipates his whole fortune have let slip all their past opportunities of doing good and becoming happy such have been slothful and wicked servants flee from ruin instantly begin to redeem the opportunity reflect that for all your present and for all your future opportunities you will be brought into judgment be careful to employ them so that you may be able to stand in the judgment psalm i    the more numerous the opportunities are which you have already lost the greater in proportion should be your future diligence  we have all had many opportunities but our opportunities have been different no two of us have been in precisely the same situation and every situation affords its peculiar opportunities each of you recollect your own situation and the opportunities which it gave you i cannot enumerate the situations or the opportunities of you all but for your assistance i shall mention some of the most general and comprehensive varieties of situation and while i mention them each of you ask your own conscience how you have improved such of them as have belonged to you  you have enjoyed health and you still enjoy it it is the opportunity for industry both in your temporal and in your spiritual concerns have you employed your health in industry for both whenever you have health be careful to employ it in this manner  or you have been broken with sickness and groaned under disease it may happen again some time or other it will happen to every one of us sickness brings the opportunity for learning patience and for exercising meekness and resignation have you exercised these in your distress whenever you are in distress neglect not to exercise them  you have been busy in the occupations of active life these present opportunities for the practice of justice honesty truth fidelity equity have you or have you not practiced these virtues practice them whenever you are busy in your callings  or it may be you have retired from business or had intervals of leisure these gave you opportunity for entering into yourselves for considering your ways for strengthening virtuous principles for deepening religious impressions in your hearts did you improve them for these purposes you will often hereafter enjoy leisure and retirement improve it always for these purposes  you have lived from year to year in affluence or you have been prosperous last year and found your wealth increased this was the season for thankfulness to god and for an increase of your beneficence and charity to the needy persist in this conduct if you have begun it make up for your past neglects by additional thankfulness to the giver and enlarged beneficence to men in every future season of plenty and success  or your lot has been scantiness and straits your fortune has been diminished your riches have fled this is the situation which gives scope for contentment submission and trust in him whose unerring wisdom orders all the vicissitudes of things you ought to have improved it and to continue to improve it for cherishing these graces  last year has perhaps found and left you living cheerfully with your friends and family rejoicing in the welfare of the husband or the wife of your affections and in the improvements of your darling children this year the same happiness may continue it is one of the sweetest joys of human life it calls for the fervours of thanksgiving the ardours of social love and the chearfullest alertness in practicing all our duties  but last year has wounded the hearts of some of you with pungnt sorrow for the unkindness of relations the cruelty of acquaintance the death of the revered parent the supporting husband the soothing wife the pleasant child or the beloved friend these are the scenes of the tenderest sorrow but they are likewise the opportunities for learning patience resignation fortitude the vanity of this world and the value of the next    time brings along with it not only opportunities for virtuous practice and improvement but also temptations to vice and degenracy every year and every day of our lives exposes us to temptations and to reflect on the temptations to which we have hitherto been exposed will both enable us to form a just judgment concerning the past and serve for our direction in the future our temptations have been either resisted or complied with from considering deliberately whether we have resisted them or complied with them we may derive great advantage have we resisted them have we avoided the vices into which they would have led us have we persisted in practicing the duties which they solicited us to neglect so far we have been conquerors and may rejoice in our victory we have improved the time let us continue to improve it it will be shameful to fall at length before the enemy whom we have often vanquished and to fall before him after by frequent victories he has been weakened and we have been strengthened yet even our former victories may contribute to our falling they may render us confident presumptuous and negligent guard against this abuse of your success let the difficulty which you experienced in resisting former temptations preserve you vigilant and ever mindful of the necessity of caution and exertion whatever were the means which contributed to your success in past instances employ the same means in every future hour of trial  but of the temptations which have assaulted us how many have prevailed against us what have these been into what sins have they betrayed us by what means did they seduce us the examination of these particulars will be unpleasant it will force upon us an humiliating sense of our own weakness it will fill us with remorse for our guilt but without submitting to it we must continue to be vanquished in every trial to degenerate more and more and become the slaves of sin those periods of time in which we have corrupted ourselves by yielding to temptations we have very great need to redeem we can redeem them only by resisting these temptations when they again attack us and by resisting every temptation for the future more strenuously than we have resisted any in time past to this the recollection and the permanent sense of our former defeats will be subservient by rendering us diffident of ourselves circumspect dependent on the grace of god instant in prayer romans xii    for his assistance careful to fly from temptations suspicious of the arts by which we have been formerly beguiled jealous of the inadvertencies by which we have given sin an advantage against us  every place is full of temptations every season abounds with them every man according to his peculiar circumstances has his own temptations against which he is chiefly concerned to defend himself his situation either puts him in danger of committing some particular sins or exposes him to some particular mode of seduction by reflecting on the variety of our past conditions each of us may bring to his remembrance the temptations to which he in particular has been exposed youth and high health contain temptations to levity to dissipation to unlawful pleasure to thoughtlessness about death and eternity sickness puts us in danger of peevishness murmuring and impatience a busy life is apt to render men worldlyminded intent upon earthly things regardless of god and religion a life of idleness or even of leisure leads men into excessive or unlawful amusement and into all the vices which spring from the want of good employment a state of prosperity and asfluence contains temptations to pride insolence presumption luxury insensibility to the miseries of mankind poverty leads to discontent anxiety complaints against providence abjectness of spirit or dishonesty the temptations belonging to the several situations in which you have hitherto been placed each of you for himself should recollect that if you have resisted them you may know how to resist them still and thus improve your future time that if you have yielded to them you may henceforth redeem the time by no longer yielding to them  thirdly we may consider our past time in respect of the manner in which we have employed it it was impossible to exclude this view of it altogether under the former head for events are what give occasion for particular instances of behavior and our behavior has always a congruity to the situations in which we are placed but it will throw new light on the subject and give farther direction for our redeeming the time to survey the past part of it as either wellemployed or illemployed or trifled away    our past time and our last year may have been wellemployed let each of us examine himself what part of it he has employed well the business of this life is to make preparation for the next whatever time we have spent in the practice of any virtue has been well spent it has been spent for the great purpose of our being while we are practicing any virtue we are going directly forward toward heaven the way of righteousness and the way everlasting is the same the hours which we have employed in sincere devotion in praying to god in praising him in adoring the perfections of his nature in humbling ourselves before him confessing our sins exercising repentance and exciting ourselves to amendment under a sense of his immediate and awful presence the hours in which our hearts have been truly engaged in these duties in secret in our families or in the public assemblies of christians the hours in which we have been indulging the silent workings of love reverence resignation toward god or cherishing these pious affections by meditation and retirement from the world all these hours have been wellemployed they have been employed in strengthening and in exercising the first and noblest of the virtues the great principles of all right conduct those principles which alone can preserve us steadfast in good practice the hours which we employed in serious consideration of the great truths of our holy religion of our state and our obligations of the vanity of earthly things of the frailty of life of our latter end of the important concerns of eternity these have been wellemployed they have contributed to excite us to our

your imperfections by degrees many however as our imperfections have been it were happy for us that we could reflect on all our past time as employed in the ways which have been mentioned but alas this is not the case    our past time may have been a great part of it has been illemployed all the time that we have spent in sin has been misspent in dishonouring god in corrupting our own hearts in laboring for misery we have need to redeem it if we would redeem it we must search out the sins which we have committed and set them in order before our eyes in all their baseness and all their guilt that by the view of them we may excite ourselves to avoid every sin hereafter if we will not we must continue to repeat the same sins to run into other sins and to abuse to our own destruction all the

majesty in swearing in profaning his name in murmuring against the dispensations of his providence have you wasted his sabbaths in listless idleness or in attention to your worldly business have you suffered them to slip away one after another without any meditation on religious truth or moral obligation without doing any thing to increase your knowledge of the principles of the gospel or to confirm your attachment to its duties have you spent any of your days in prosecuting an unjust design in catching at dishonest gain in oppressing the weak in imposing on the ignorant in treading upon

deeper corruption you have to eradicate and the less time remains for accomplishing the arduous task lose no part of that little time shortlived creatures as we are we cannot afford to employ a single hour in sinful courses    a great part of our past time has been trifled away it too needs to be redeemed if it has not been abused to bad purposes yet it has not been used to any good purpose whatever part of our time has contributed nothing to the improvement of our souls though it has not been employed in corrupting them whatever part has not promoted our salvation though it has not directly counteracted it has been trifled away a very great part of our time is necessarily spent in such a manner as can have no influence on our preparation for eternity so far as this is necessary it is not blameable it is but one instance of the imperfection of our nature infancy and childhood is the age of trifling reason is dormant the sense of good and evil is but beginning to show itself the faculties are too imperfectly opened for a just conception of things spiritual and eternal through all the periods of life a considerable proportion of our time must be spent in sleep in exercise relaxation and amusement needful for the health and vigor of the body as well as for the soundness and alacrity of the mind how great a part of your past time has thus elapsed if in these things you have not exceeded the bounds of moderation it has passed innocently but still it has been nowise subservient to the important purposes of eternity since then so great a part of our time has slipped away and must continue to slip away without promoting these purposes can we be too diligent in making the best use of those parts of it which are capable of promoting them but which of us can say that we have spent no more time than was necessary in these ways or that we have wasted none of it in listless indolence counting the tedious hours and wishing that they would pass more swiftly what is the whole life of many but one uninterrupted series of thoughtlessness levity and dissipation does this become creatures who amidst all the avocations of this short life must make preparation for eternity

profitable business that you may avoid the folly and the temptations of idleness never indulge yourselves in relaxation and amusement when you have a call to any useful office render your very relaxations as far as their nature can permit indirectly subservient to your salvation by taking care that they be always such as render you fitter for those employments which directly promote it  i

have hitherto resisted that you may persist in employing your time well in those instances in which you have been accustomed to employ it well and that by your future circumspection and diligence you may in some measure retrieve those parts of it which you have either misspent or trifled away to redeem the time is of great importance and of real necessity to us all the best are capable of great improvement and are bound to make a constant progress to the very end of their lives but if there be any of you who have yet done nothing for eternity without speedily redeeming the time you must be

are hastening to the grave where there is no work nor device eccles ix  0   sermon xv the truth of christianity confirmed by the manner in which its evidences were proposed though this argument be prosecuted at large in dissert  on subjects relating to the genius and the evidences of christianity it is not perhaps supersuous or useless to exhibit its force collected into a narrower compass which may happen to obtain for it a  general attention  preached in the high church of edinburgh may         at the opening of the general assembly of the church of scotland john viii    jesus answered and said unto them though i bear record of myself yet my record is true in the preceding part of this chapter we are informed that some phariss brought a woman caught in adultery to jesus asking his judgment in the case and prepared to take advantage against him whatever his determination should be but he disconcerted their malice by his wisdom and afterward affirmed the excellence of his own character and office saying i am the light of the world ver     the pharisees censured this as vainglorious boasting characteristical of an impostor thou bear record of thyself thy record is not true ver     he answers in the text though i bear record of myself yet my record is true the answer is not applicable only to that one occasion it naturally implies this general sentiment that christ jesus proposed and urged the evidences of his mission in a manner which far from lessening their weight makes an addition to it  there is scarcely any test of truth less ambiguous than this that it becomes more undeniable the more severely it is examined and the more various the lights in which it is viewed christianity has many features perceivable at first sight which intimate its divine original but every new atttitude in which it can be placed discovers additional marks of its divinity the strength of its several evidences considered in themselves has been often and fully displayed the manner in which these evidences were at first proposed has not been so commonly attended to that that manner contains many separate presumptions of the truth of christianity it shall be the business of this discourse to evince  in prosecution of this design it will be necessary to examine distinctly first the manner in which christ and his apostles proposed the evidences of the gospel originally and secondly the manner in which they proposed them in consequence of opposition  first let us attend to the manner in which christ and his apostles proposed the evidences of the gospel originally that is in addressing those who had not yet shown prejudices or raised objections against the gospel  in this situation they simply exhibited the evidences of their mission without either illustrating their strength by reasoning or studiously preventing objections against them they published doctrines really excellent but they did not affect on every occasion either to assert that they are excellent or to affirm that their excellence proves their divinity they wrought miracles actually attended with all the circumstances which could contribute to their credibility and to their force but they were not at pains to show by arguments in what manner or how much the several circumstances contributed to the one purpose or to the other in many instances they discovered their knowledge of the hearts of men and they predicted future events but they left men to conclude of themselves from these instances that they had a divine mission they scarcely ever drew the inference they proved jesus to be the messiah from ancient prophecies but they proved it in the simplest manner sometimes by only appealing to the old testament in general often by barely quoting a particular passage always without justifying the application by subtle reasoning that this was uniformly their manner in proposing the evidences of their mission originally or to those who did not directly show a spirit of opposition might be proved by a large detail of instances from the new testament but that would be tedious and in this auditory it is not necessary  but does not this representation of their manner give countenance to an objection which has been urged against christianity that it was not in its first publication founded upon argument it does not give countenance so much as in appearance to this objection in the most important sense of it it implies not in the remotest manner that christianity is not founded on or to speak more properly supported by just and rational evidence for the observations which we have made relate not at all to the matter of the evidence but merely to the manner of proposing it but does it not give a color for affirming at least that the evidence of the gospel was proposed in an improper and imperfect manner if it give a color for this objection it gives no more this manner is no real presumption against the truth of christianity on the contrary it is a strong presumption for it  it is no presumption against the truth of christianity for that manner was neither improper nor imperfect it was sufficient for producing belief in the circumstances in which it was used if the gospel in its first publication was not supported by argument it was notwithstanding supported by evidence evidence is different from reasoning evidence perceived is the immediate cause of belief reasoning is but one means of bringing men to perceive the evidence and it is a means which is far from being necessary in every case the strongest conviction possible is produced by simple intuition the evidence of natural and moral truths and in general of all matters of fact requires not a process of reasoning in order to its being perceived a fact is exhibited and from it a conclusion concerning another fact is directly inferred the natural constitution of the mind determines us to make the inference and to adopt it without any comparison of ideas the evidences of the gospel are facts miracles for instance the perception of which leads the mind naturally to infer the truth of the gospel the facts are perceived without reasoning and when they are perceived the conclusion is likewise deduced without reasoning natural evidence is by the original formation of the soul adapted to the understanding there are principles of belief essential to man on which it lays hold and by means of which it produces immediate conviction in the unperverted christ exhibited evidence in a way fit for operating on the natural principles of belief he made men to perceive the facts from which the truth of his mission directly followed this was enough it is the very method by which men are daily convinced in similar cases  evidence of every kind admits reasoning the evidence of our religion is capable of copious illustrations and defenses by argument but it is in no case necessary in order to conviction that a person attend to all the reasonings of which the subject is susceptible if he perceive the evidence without them it would be altogether superfluous it deserves to be remarked also that the evidences of the gospel do not appear in the very same light to us in which they appeared to those to whom they were originally proposed our situation differs from theirs in many circumstances and it is from these circumstances that most of the reasonings arise which have been introduced into the defense of christianity for our conviction reasoning may be necessary but it by no means follows that it was necessary for convincing them their situation gave not the same occasion for it to them the evidence was directly exhibited if it was real and natural evidence it would produce belief in them  their conviction would likewise be entirely rational we are apt to regard nicety in canvassing evidence and scrupulosity in admitting it with too favorable an eye what renders assent irrational is its being yielded to improper evidence not its being yielded readily to such as is proper assent is always rational when it is yielded to real and just evidence the more readily it is yielded it is the more rational to be imposed upon by insufficient evidence shows a defect of understanding not to perceive natural evidence quickly without a multitude of arguments and illustrations shows an equal defect the stomach is sound when it digests easily by its own force the eye is good when it perceives objects clearly without artificial assistances true vigor of understanding is entirely similar to those who gave no signs of their being distempered with incredulity the evidences of christianity were simply exhibited this is no presumption against christianity it was sufficient for producing firm and rational belief in such  this manner is in several ways a very strong presumption for christianity  far from implying that no real evidence was given it necessarily implies that the evidence was strong the strongest evidence in every kind operates most quickly on the understanding if evidence be weak or doubtful its force cannot be at all perceived without the aid of reasoning and illustration it is certain that the evidence of the gospel was at first merely exhibited it is equally certain that many were in fact convinced by the first proposal of it it is therefore undeniable that its evidence was not only real but also strong men are very credulous they often believe without just evidenee we confess it but it is only when the want of evidence is concealed by specious reasoning or by some other artifice this was not the case in the original publication of the gospel if there had been any defect in its evidence the defect must have been perceived for no means at all were used to hide it if the evidence had not been strong it could not possibly have produced belief for it was barely shown very certain truths have been rejected because the proof of them was not sufficiently urged but there never was a falsehood successfully inculcated by a naked and artless exhibition of pretended evidence  again this manner was the fittest possible for convincing the unprejudiced the more simply evidence can be proposed consistently with clearness the better it answers its end whenever reasoning is not necessary it burdens the evidence and perplexes the understanding this is in a peculiar manner true of matters of fact which we are naturally formed for inferring immediately at a single step and it holds especially when the bulk of mankind are addressed propose to an ordinary man evidence really suited to the nature of the subject he assents without hesitation enter upon the discussions which ingnuity has introduced into every subject he understands you not every man is mde capable of bing convinced by real evidence but many cannot comprehend the subtties of disputation christianity was intended for the use of the generality not for the entertainment of the curious if its evidence was real simply to present it would most effectually produce belief in an ordinary man if it was not fit for producing belief when thus proposed it was not adapted to the bulk of mankind god has suited its evidence to their powers christ has proposed it in the manner fittest for convincing them by this it is declared not obscurely that the gospel is the offspring of the same wisdom which fixed the human constitution  this manner is likewise most suitable to the character of a divine teacher it sets jesus in direct opposition to impostors they magnify slender evidence they can produce no better and therefore they labor to persuade men by every art that what they have produced is considerable it becomes a teacher truly sent from god to give on the contrary evidence of his mission fit in its own nature for producing belief and conscious of its inherent strength to propose it without show in mahomet we find the former manner in christ the latter in perfection that looks very like imposture this bears the unequivocal features of truth when a man asserts at every turn that his arguments are strong it is at least suspicious one who has no design to bias the judgment proposes his reasons and leaves them to make their strength to be felt simplicity of manner is always an indication of truth and jesus possessed it in the highest degree  this shows likewise that he was conscions of his title to the character which he claimed a person who knows that he intends to deceive is naturally suspicious but jesus discovers no anxiety to foresee and prevent difficulties and his apostles relate things as they knew them to be without any appearance of concern about the consequences this is that honest confidence which flows naturally from integrity which a deceiver never can put on it proves them to be what they said they were  simplicity of manner is moreover an indication of genuine dignity mahomet affected dignity but it was of a false kind and it was totally misplaced he haughtily disdained to give evidence of his mission to have given it was absolutely incumbent on him at the same time he made an ostentation of evidence it was in avoiding this that true greatness would have appeared this betrayed a littleness of mind it showed his dignity to be affected at other times only to hide the want of evidence jesus assumed a high character but his manner showed that it belonged to him it was a plain expression of it he sustained it with natural ease and unaffected majesty he gave evidence very readily he disdained only to display it with parade and ostentation truly this was the son of god mat xxvii      thus the manner in which the evidences of the gospel were originally proposed contains many presumptions of its truth they are so strong that if you suppose it false it must appear unaccountable that ever that manner should have been adopted and impossible that ever it could have succeeded  but proper as this manner was it did not secure christianity from opposition vice and prejudice suggested many objections against its evidences they were proposed to christ and his apostles and they induced them to depart from their ordinary manner of simply exhibiting evidence and to adopt a different manner the examination of which was the second part of our design  in what manner then did christ support his claim when he addressed those who formed objections or listened to them he asserted his mission and avowed his character in the most peremptory and explicit terms in confuting mens cavils in illustrating what had occasioned them in correcting their mistakes in instilling juster principles he often gave a more ample exhibition of excellent doctrine he asserted likewise that the gospel is excellent and he urged its excellence as a proof of its divinity he reminded those who opposed him of the miracles which he had wrought he affirmed expressly and frequently that they were wrought on purpose to prove his mission and establish his doctrine it was denied that his miracles had force enough to prove that he came from god they were even ascribed to magic he demonstrated the absurdity of the charge and vindicated their force by clear and solid argument he moreover showed in several instances that his miracles were direct evidences of the principal doctrines of his religion as being actual experienced exertions of the very powers which these doctrines ascribed to him or of the most similar powers that could be rendered objects of sense he often appealed in express terms to particular ancient predictions and showed that they were fulfilled in himself the jews had formed a very inadequate idea of the messiah and were hindered from perceiving that jesus was he by their overlooking some whole predictions and some capital circumstances in other predictions concerning him our savior pointed out these and reasoned from them in order to perfect their idea of the messiah and remove their prejudices against himself they observed in jesus some characters inconsistent with the conception of the messiah which they thought they had derived from the prophets he showed that these characters were truly consistent with the prophetical descriptions of the messiah nay often that they were plainly included in them they missed in him some characters which they ascribed to the messiah he proved sometimes that he himself really had thse characters and at other times that their expectation of finding them in the messiah proceeded only from their ignorance of the true meaning of the prophecies the opposition which was made to him led him not only to illustrate and urge the evidences of his mission separately but also to collect them together and display their united force time will not allow me either to produce examples of these several particulars or to show how closely and with how great propriety the apostles imitated their master in all of them we proceed therefore to enquire what advantages christianity has derived from this alteration in the manner of proposing its evidences  by means of this alteration the truth of christianity is rendered more immediately evident and the defense of it easier and shorter for by it considerable difficulties are avoided and plausible objections prevented by claiming a divine mission so frequently and so explicitly christ rendered it indisputable that he intended his whole doctrine to stand on the authority of a divine revelation this has a very great and extensive influence on the manner of examining the truth of christianity it makes it plain that very many of the most specious arguments of inidels are really nothing at all to the purpose that no objection against any particular doctrines of christianity is of weight in the question except it show that they cannot possibly be true that therefore the only question is whether christ had in fact a divine mission and that this can be legitimately determined in no other way but by a close examination of the positive evidence produced if this evidence is not directly confuted his authority is alone sufficient for proving that any doctrine which in its nature may be true is true it demands our unreserved assent to whatever he really taught by his express declarations of the intention of his miracles he has rendered their connection with his doctrine obvious no man can honestly overlook it or represent them as mere unmeaning acts of kill or power the frequency of his appeals to prophecy removes all manner of difficulty in determining whether he claimed the high character of the messiah or only that of an ordinary prophet every difficulty in revelation is magnified by infidels into an objection against it christianity stands clear of many difficulties by the manner of its publication to a certain degree it is what infidels would wish is this no indication of its truth it is the most considerable because it could be accomplished without forfeiting other great advantages by no possible means except the delicate and singular conjunction of contrary manners which jesus introduced  as the manner in which he supported his mission on occasion of opposition prevents some objections so it removes others it gives us his own account of the nature and force of the evidences which he produced and his own answers to several objections against them infidels have never confuted these they have scarcely attempted it is this reconcilable to candor is it not an acknowledgment of weakness they ought to have begun with this by neglecting it they have left a strong enemy behind in possession of a fortress which they found impregnable and in consequence of this all their advances are insecure and their successes are but apparent the reasonings of jesus stand unanswered in them christians may rest with the fullest assurance and in them they find not only models for defenses of their religion but also principles directly applicable to the confutation of many of the objections which have been more lately raised against it  the manner which christ adopted when he met with opposition gives a new proof of the strength of the evidence which he produced in convincing many when it was simply exhibited its strength was exerted and it was displayed by the exertion but prejudice or indisposition of mind often hinders the strongest evidence from convincing all in this case the strength of the evidence can be shown only by reasoning and by reasoning it may be shown that it ought to have convinced all the evidence which christ offered was examined and by the examination its strength was justified that must be truth which has evidence capable of a full vindication by solid argument  three are many who cannot be convinced by the mere exhibition of evidence the distempered need medicine as well as food some are either inattentive or prejudiced or prone to doubt or so fond of reasoning as to demand it in every case these can be convinced only by an argumentative display of evidence christ often met with such he adapted his manner to them he used the natural means of bringing them to believe he did all that could be done for the conviction even of the most incredulous is not credit due to the teacher who never declined using any proper means of conviction is it no evidence of truth that the gospel was capable of being supported by every kind of means  but is there nothing in all this contrary to that simplicity which was remarked in his original manner as a strong indication of his divine character and mission are there not assertions of his mission and dignity appeals to the evidences which he had produced professed displays of them and threatenings against those who resisted them but all these without exception were occasioned by opposition this gives a full account of them in this situation they had entire propriety they were even no more than justly varied expressions of the very characters which shone forth in his original manner  to hear and answer objections readily when men raised them to vindicate the evidences of his mission by reasoning when their force was called in question was even necessary for showing that he was sincere in claiming a mission and secure of his title to it when a mans right is called in question not to assert it is to relinquish it  ostentation is inconsistent with true dignity but to illustrate evidence after it has been misunderstood to enforce it by reasoning on those who have not felt its force to claim whatever is at the same time proved to be due is not ostentation it is truly the natural ease and condescension which is so essential to genuine dignity that pride finds it necessary to put it on the contrary conduct would have plainly betrayed supercilious haughtiness  it may be added that the nature of all christs reasonings is expressive both of conscious truth and of real greatness his reasonings are calculated always for convincing never for making a show of ingenuity they contain nothing either mean or weak or artificial they are all concise direct clear and cogent impostors affect to disdain answering objections or instead of solving them by argument they elude them by mere confident assertions by artifice or by declamation in justifying the evidences of his mission no less than in originally presenting them christ is a perfect contrast to impostors he has not a single lineament which is not the reverse of theirs is it possible that he should nevertheless be one of them  thus by christs vindication of his mission the features of divinity observable in his original manner are only thrown into a new attitude in the most opposite situations he preserved the character uniform and consistent he only varied the expressions of it as the case required cunning will enable a man who only affects a character to escape detection in one situation in which he has carefully practiced his part but if a man sustain it with equal propriety in sudden reverses of condition it must be his real and natural character  upon the whole the manner in which christ bare record to himself both originally and in consequence of opposition is in many ways a strong proof that his record was true the manner proper to either of these situations taken alone has some defects and it has some advantages he has used the one manner so as to correct the imperfections of the other and he has united the opposite advantages of both his whole manner whether we consider it in relation to the conviction of men or in relation to the character of a divine teacher is absolutely perfect there is nothing wanting nothing superfluos nothing misplaced it has an excellence which has not yet been mentioned it is an application of evidence which shows the greatest strength of understanding and the highest powers of reason to judge unerringly when evidence should be only exhibited and when it is proper to enforce it to present none that is not solid to place every argument by one happy turn in a striking point of view to preserve all this propriety throughout an address to mankind continued for years this is a pitch of excellence which uninspired persons attain only when natural vigor of mind and superior genius and penetration are united with the best means of intellectual improvement neither christ nor his apostles had an opportunity of attaining it by natural means they must have owed it therefore to supernatural causes they must have been as they affirmed themselves to be persons commissioned and inspired by god  all these strong presumptions of truth and divinity tend directly to confirm our faith in the gospel faith will always operate on the heart and life in proportion to its strength attention to the multitudes of circumstances of the most various kinds which cur in proclaiming that our religion is of god will enable us unaffected by trivial objections to rest in it with full assurance faith thus invigorated and enlivened will not remain inactive it will instigate all who are possessed of it to the hearty obedience of the gospel if such faith prevail in our hearts my reverend fathers and brethren it will moreover diffuse life and spirit through all our ministrations  the manner in which we have seen that the gospel was published at first may likewise suggest to us many rules of great importance both in our public and in our private addresses to mankind particularly in relation to the best manner of communicating and inculcating religious truths but i will leave these to be collected by your own reflections rather than encroach upon your patience suffer me only to hint with the utmost brevity that this example will direct us to propose to our hearers not abstruse notions or refined speculations but plain truth to exhibit it to their view not in a dry analysis or labored and artificial distribution but in striking maxims warm sentiments and natural arrangement to support it by solid evidence and convincing argument not by abstract reasonings or intricate deductions much less by forced interpretations dubious positions or plausible sophisms to avoid altogether questions which are frivolous unedifying or interminable and never without necessity to enter even on such points of nice discussion as seem to be of some importance and of possible solution to express our instructions in the language of scripture and of common sense not in the learned phraseology of either the ancient or the modern schools of science to vary both the matter and the manner of our addresses according to the capacities and situations of those for whom they are designed and always so as to reach their understandings by the nearest and asiest road and to touch their hearts with the greatest force in one word studiously to aim never at displaying or even gratifying ourselves but constantly and in all respects at profiting others by bringing them to a firm faith of the simple principles of the gospel by exciting them to a lively perception of them and by persuading them to comply with their genuine intention in all goodness and righteousness and truth ph v     sermon xvi the advantages of the virtuous for the enjoyment of external good psalm xxxvii    a little that a righteous man has is better tha the riches of many wicked of the different courses by which mankind pursue happiness it must be acknowledged fair to give that the preference which confers the greatest happiness when all circumstances are supposed equal if it can be proved that the righteous are happier than the wicked in the same situation it will follow undeniably that virtue is much more favorable than vice to our interest in the present world and that without taking the rewards of eternity into the account virtue ought to be the choice of every prudent man but even this is not all that can be said with truth in behalf of virtue my text puts the case much stronger a little that a righteous man has is better than the riches of many wicked a small portion of the good things of the world gives the virtuous man more real enjoyment not than the same portion but more than affluence than riches nay than the riches of many joined together can yield to the vicious  were we fully convinced of this it must recommend virtue very strongly for it would urge us to the practice of it from a regard to our present happiness in order to convince us of this salatury truth i shall illustrate and confirm the psalmists maxim by showing  first that a good man has greater enjoyment from a little than the wicked can have from the largest fortune and  secondly that he has more durable enjoyment  first a good man has greater enjoyment purer and more solid satisfaction from a little than the wicked can have from the largest fortune  it will scarcely be denied by any person who at all reflects either that outward possessions can make us happy only so far as we enjoy them or that the foundation of enjoyment must be laid in ourselves that health of body and freedom from acute pain or severe distemper are absolutely necessary for our deriving pleasure from the greatest abundance of external things is acknowledged by all why is not the necessity of a sound and healthful temper of mind as universally acknowledged how foolishly do men estimate the requisites to happiness the body is only the instrument by means of which the soul receives pleasure from outward things the health of that is confessed to be necessary for our enjoying them with what consistence can it be denied that the health of this is at least as necessary it cannot be denied without contradicting the plainest experience who is there that cannot recollect the time when grief for the death of a beloved friend regret for the loss of something valuable anxiety for what he longed to possess or dread of an impending danger rendered those things not insipid only but disagreeable and loathsome which in a different state of mind would have given him the highest pleasure needs there a clearer evidence that the immediate and principal foundation of enjoyment lies in the inward temper if the temper of mind fits us for enjoyment a little will give us great satisfaction but if our temper be irregular and unhealthy it will spoil our relish for every object and render us incapable of extracting any real satisfaction from the greatest affluence  vice produces a temper which is very unfavourable to our enjoyment it destroys the constitution and breaks the vigor of the soul it subjects it to the most uneasy feelings and the most painful passions the whole head is sick and the whole heart faint from the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it but wounds and bruises and putrefying sores isa i      to a soul in this manner exulcerated and diseased what enjoyment can rise from the greatest wealth the perturbations with which vice fills the soul are more incompatible with enjoyment than any distemper which can afflict the body the burning fever does not render us more incapable of tasting pleasure than insatiable desires and boisterous passions agitated by them the soul boileth it tosseth it cannot rest the agonies of the stone do not more corrode the body than careful anxiety fretting peevishness pining discontent wasting envy fell revenge gnawing remorse and their kindred agonies the genuine progeny of vice corrode the mind the tortures which they inflict force us to nauseate the best things in life as the ravenous wolf devours the harmless lamb and converts it into its own substance they swallow up all the sensations of the soul and by the mixture even of such as are most pleasant become the more excruciating objects which might afford the sweetest gratification they render bitterer than gall when a mans mind is in the power of every vicious passion all things provoke or deject him and by heightening his inward misery increase his incapacity of enjoyment is our neighbor fortunate his prosperity is only fuel thrown into the fire which rages in our souls is he unfortunate his calamities give us joy but it is a poisoned joy which swells our hearts into greater naughtiness and malignity does the world censure us conscience is roused it ratifies the censure it stings with redoubled force we are exasperated into fury we are raised into madness does the world commend us our heart tells us that we deserve it not it can give us no sincere pleasure the feeling of our demerit is strengthened by being contrasted with the opinion of the world we despise ourselves and abhor ourselves the more a vicious temper finds occasion of disquiet and disgust in every situation it deprives a man of that internal serenity and peace which is the sole foundation of happiness what are the riches of many wicked what are all the kingdoms of the earth able to avail the man who is wretched in himself the fiercest shocks of thunder winds and rains cannot produce more dreadful convulsions in the frame of nature than those into which tumultuous exorbitant and jarring passions throw the soul they ravage all its enjoyments vice lets in upon the soul an inundation of torments which overwhelms it as the flood of old overwhelmed the earth when god opened the windows of heaven and broke up the fountains of the great deep when the waters prevailed and increased greatly upon the earth and killed all flesh that moved upon the earth and destroyed every living substance that was upon the face of the ground genesis vii              all is chaos and disorder all is uproar and dissatisfaction  on the other hand virtue establishes a temper in the soul which fits us for taking pleasure in whatever we possess it dispells the black clouds which overcast the vicious heart and intercept the comfort which might arise from outward things they are scattered by its brightness they fly away before it as the shadows of the night before the rising sun they leave the soul open and clear like the serenest heavens like the sovereign voice of god whose offspring it is virtue calms those inward storms which would disturb our peace it commands the boisterous winds which tear the wicked breast to cease it quells the commotion which sin had raised and made to overflow the wicked like a wide breaking in of waters and to desolte all their pleasures as righteous noah found refuge in the ark from all the spouting cataracts of heaven and all the gushing fountains of the deep so the good man in the srentiy which his virtue has established finds security against the inundation of pains by which the enjoyments of the sinner are swept away by directing all our passions to their proper objects and by moderating their impetuosity virtue strikes at the root of every corrupt lust and every perturbation fatal to our enjoyment so far as it prevails it cures the soul of dissatisfaction and disease no importunate appetite no vexatious passion no sickening remorse no shuddering dread no terrifying forebodings of future misery wound the peace of the righteous or render his possessions unsatisfying virtue cherishes the most pleasant affections contentment love cheerfulness joy hope and by their influence it sweetens the ordinary comforts of human life and keeps the soul in a proper habit for turning all things to the best advantage it produces a natural and regular motion of all our powers above all it promotes the active operation of kind and devout affections which give a soundness and vigor to the mind more favorable than the greatest flow of bodily health to an exquisite relish of life and its most common blessings a temper so delightful as that which virtue establishes has power enough to overcome the bitterness of sorrow much abler must it be to improve all our sources of enjoyment and heighten all the pleasures which naturally issue from them the temper of the good man fits him for enjoying all the happiness of others and for tasting satisfaction from the compassion with which he regards their pains if the world approves him he has its approbation without abatement it is confirmed by his own consciousness of worth and the joy which attends this consciousness cannot be extinguished by the censure of the ignorant and the malicious in exerting itself to rise above that censure it is often brightened and rendered the more exhilarating a virtuous temper lays the mind open to every satisfaction that comes in its way prepares it for embracing and enjoying it and it renders the man so well disposed so happy in himself that almost every object throws some satisfaction in his way  thus the temper of the mind is the very foundation of enjoyment vice spoils this temper virtue alone can preserve it sound in the same outward circumstances therefore it is plain that the enjoyment of the good man will be far superior but very little reflection is necessary to convince us that from the same principles it follows undeniably that even in the most unequal circumstances even when the wicked are supposed to ave the greatest uence and the righteous to possess but a little the latter have much gt enment than the formr  we are very at to confound those external things which are only the materials of enjoyment with enjoyment itself they are however totally distinct every days experience proves that a man may have many external things in his possession from which he derives no real enjoyment every person is forced to make this observation on some occasions in the present argument it is of great importance to attend to the distinction riches are able only so far as they yield enjoymnt they can therefore be of little value to the wicked man whose temper renders him so incapable of enjoying them his soul is diseased though he had alone the riches of many wealthy men they could give him little sincere delight they may purchase objects the fittest for gratifying the senses but by these his senses are not gratified they may procure for him all the elegances of life but his inward habit sophisticates the pleasure which they ought to give him how different is the condition of the good man he may possess very little but his inward temper secures to him the full enjoyment of whatever he possesses a very little is sufficient for the necessaries of life and if he have only the necessaries of life he can derive from them more solid pleasure even of sense than the wicked derive from all their riches in reality there is not so great a difference as there seems to be between the homely pleasure of the poorest cottager and the splendid luxury of the greatest monarch there is generally more cheerfulness and contentment in the cottage than in the palace this is at the very lowest a demonstration that the poor have more real satisfaction and enjoyment than the rich can easily believe to be compatible with their situation nevertheless a few obvious remarks may enable the rich to form a conception of it it is confessed that by continual use the most sumptuous enjoyments lose their relish they become common and familiar they are in time despised by those who had at first the quickest taste of them custom brings down the enjoyment of the prince almost to a level with that of the peasant the rich find their accustomed pleasures so insipid that they are continually searching for new delights but the poor remain contented with the same simple fare and without a wish for variety repeat it day after day with undiminished relish an evidence that the simplest things give the most real and lasting pleasure it is felt by the luxurious themselves amidst all the variations of entertainment which they introduce they never banish from their tables bread and water the necessaries of life the constant viands of the poor in these plain productions of nature they find solider satisfaction than in all the refined inventions of the epicure when at some times whetted with hunger and unable to procure their ordinary delicacies they have been obliged to take up with homely fare it gave them a higher gratification than they found at other times in all their dainties by acknowledging that it did they unintentionally give their suffrage for the reality of the poor mans enjoyment you will say it was owing only to the accidental keenness of their appetite granted but this confirms our argument they commonly prevent their appetites and by doing so they necessarily prevent their pleasure which arises chiefly from satisfying appetite the poor man has always this advantage he runs not before his appetites he eats and drinks only to satisfy them and from their being satisfied he derives that enjoyment every day which is so unusual to the luxurious his senses being neither palled nor vitiated he uses the carsest food with more exquisite relish than the papered debauchd palate of the voluptuous can admit but if the snsal pleasures of the poor and the rich be in themselves so nearly upon a level the poor man who by being virtuous possesses inward tranquillity must have great advantage for enjoyment above a rich man who is wicked and selftormented the pleasure of the former is pure all the pleasures of the latter are woefully sophisticated better is a dry morsel and quietness of spirit therewith than a house full of sacrifices with the inward trouble prove xvii   xv    which vice produces if the righteous man have only the necessaries of life they are better than all the treasures of the wicked but there are very few who have not more than the necessaries of life a little will procure a share of conveniences and its comforts sufficient to satisfy the moderate and wellregulated appetites of the virtuous man enough for this is as much as his heart desires it is truly as much as the wealthiest can have whatever a man possesses more than he can use to some good purpose is nothing to him contributes nothing to his happiness yields him no recompense for the trouble which it costs him to take care of it this is so unquestionably true that the general voice of mankind pronounces the middle state of life happir than the highest  insatiable desires in common with every irregular and faulty passion obstruct our enjoyment of outward things by spoiling the inward temper they likewise obstruct in it a way peculiar to themselves it is not the less true for being trite that our natural wants are few and easily supplied but that no abundance can supply the extravagance and multitude of artificial wants which arise in the ungoverned mind he that loves silver shall not be satisfied with silver let him have ever so much nor he that loves abundance with increase eccles v  0  be it ever so great in the fullness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits job xx     it holds not of riches only but of every external object of desire now the lawless imagination of the vicious man by painting the objects of desire in false colors makes them to appear much more valuable than they are his desire gathers strength proportioned to their fancied value and the constant habit of indulging it raises it to a degree of vehemence far exceeding even his own opinion of the value of its objects no enjoyment of these objects can satisfy its craving or quench its ardour it is the fire that says not it is enough prove xxx    exorbitant desire is a dropsy of the soul it parches it with a thirst which far from being allayed is inflamed by every draught it cannot possibly be satisfied the more studiously it is indulged the more importunately it cries give give incapable of gratification from its own objects it likewise renders a man unfit for deriving gratification from other objects the man who is agerly engrossed by one darling pursuit finds every pleasure that is foreign to it tasteless at least if not disgusting as in deformed bodies the distorted member itself a deformity and encumbrance exhausts the nourishment of the other members rendering the whole a puny skeleton so overgrown appetites and passions themselves insatiable deprive all our other powers of their enjoyment and rob the soul of its vigor its satisfaction and its happiness all the riches which a wicked man can possess all the materials of enjoyment which they can enable him to accumulate instead of filling his exorbitant desires render them more exorbitant increase the distortion of his soul and put satisfaction the farther beyond his reach the greater the abundance which he possesses the more frequent the gratifications which his situation affords to his desires the more incapable he is of real enjoyment a pitiable wretched state but a state into which the want of selfgovernment necessarily plunges men you may every day observe it realized in the restlessness of the rich and the voluptuous perpetually running from place to place and from entertainment to entertainment weary of the present impatient for the future but sick of it also the moment they have begun to taste it far different is the state of the virtuous man it is the very province of virtue to reduce all our desires within their natural limits it moderates their strength lessens their number fixes their just balance none consumes the food of the rest and therefore a very little satisfies them all as in a healthful body the nourishment distributed regularly to all the members renders the whole wellproportioned vigorous and agile so in the virtuous soul the proper gratification being allowed to every natural passion it contributes its part to enjoyment and happiness  all the kinds of vice obstruct enjoyment in the ways that have been mentioned every vice distempers the soul and spoils its constitution many vices consist wholly in the exorbitance of desire and every vice contributes to the exorbitance of our desires by destroying their just proportion but there are particular vices which produce likewise other effects no less fatal to real enjoyment you readily think of avarice it forbids the application of riches to any of the necessary ends of life it proscribes every possible use of wealth the more a covetous man has the more anxious his trouble in preserving it the more excruciating his dread of losing it the more parching and unquenchable his thirst for greater riches but wonder not when you hear intemperance mentioned along with it intemperance it is the very organ of sensual pleasure pleasure is its direct aim and end if any of the vices can improve our enjoyment of outward things it must be intemperance yet it truly gives a less share even of the pleasures of sense than sobriety and temperance the habit of excess deadens the sense renders it so callous and unfeeling that the pleasure of indulging it is reduced to little more than a cessation of the uneasiness of importunate desire but the moderation which temperance prescribes preserves the senses quick and tender and susceptible of all the pleasures which objects are fit to give  from these observatios it appars that a little can yield to the virtuous more genuine pleasure even of sens than the greatest riches can yield to the wicked but the virtuous have still greatr advantages from affluence the wicked derive only snsual plasure from a competence from a very little the good man derives far noblr joys snsual pleasure is of the most abject kind alone it cannot rnder life so much as tolerable dspicable is the life which is filled up with a succession of eating drinking sleeping contemptible is the man who spends all his days in the most refined luxury in the most artfully varied pleasures but never prforms a gnerous friendly human or charitable deed a single mment of serious reflection would pierce his heart with a pungnt feeling of his own meanness and insignificanc the total absence of reflection cannot prvent his feeling very often that h is unsatid and wretchd or his groaning inwardly under the pressure of languor and satity he cannot be constantly employed in gratiying his senses no agreeable reflection no chearing slfapprobation can irradiate his intervals of enjoyment they are painfully wasted in overwhelming surfeit listless yawning or fretful impatience for a new engagement the human soul has faculties which demand sublimer objects it may become so degenerate as never to aspire to them but the lowest degeneracy cannot extinguish a distressing sensation of inanity and dissatisfaction in the want of them while the wicked are in many ways rendered incapable of a full relish of the very enjoyment which they professedly pursue they pine under a tormenting sense of the want of higher enjoyments which the corruption of their souls smothers every thought of pursuing but virtue teaches the true use of the worldly mammon from earthly pelf it enables the good man to extract the sublimest joy besides purer pleasures of sense than any of which the wicked are susceptible he enjoys delights with which these are not worthy to be compared the exquisite delights of benevolence and of piety  a good man shows savor and lends he is gracious and full of compassion psalm cxii      he employs his substance in beneficence he obtains from it all the joys which attend the exercise of friendship generosity charity and all the joys which spring from reflection on a godlike temper joys which resemble the happiness of heaven the raptures of angels the blessedness of god it is more blessed to give than to receive acts xx     said he who could fairly estimate every sentiment of the human heart its dignity its beauty and its blessedness job attests from his own experience when the ear heard me then it blessed me and when the eye saw me it gave witness to me because i delivered the poor that cried and the fatherless and him that had none to help him the blessing of him that was ready to persh came upon me and i caused the widows heart to sing for joy i put on righteousness and it clothed me my judgment was as a robe and a diadem i was eyes to the blind and feet was i to the lame i was a father to the poor my root was spread out by the waters and the dew lay all night upon my branch my glory was fresh in me and my bow was renewed in my hand unto me men gave ear and waited and kept silence at my counsel after my words they spoke not again and my speech dropped upon them and they waited for me as for the rain and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain i chose out their way and sat chief and dwelt as a king in the army as one that comfort the mourners job xxix       this good man was overwhelmed with poverty and disease all the means of beneficence were taken from him he was abused by those whom he had fed his glory was turned into contempt he felt the reverse with all the sensibility of honest indignation but now they that are younger than i have me in derision whose fathers i would have disdaind to have set with the dogs of my flock and now i am their song yea i am their bywd they abor me they flee from me and spare t to spit in my face job xxx      0  but even in this depth of complicated distress he was not destitute of comfort the remembrance of his bnfcen upheld him and inspired a chearing condence if i have withheld the poor from their desire or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail or have eaten my morsel alone and the fatherless has not eaten thereof for from my youth he was brought up with me as with a father if i have seen any perish for want of clothing or any poor without covering if his oins have not blessed me and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep if i have lift up my hand against the fatherless when i saw my help in the gate then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade and mine arm be broken from the bone chap xxxi         if you have a dear brother or a beloved son is not this the character which you would wish him to sustain in possessing it would you not reckon him excellent and happy compared with the man who employs his substance in such offices of beneficence how pitiful how wretched does he appear who expends it in the most splendid gratifications of sense wealth in the hands of benevolence gives pleasure to thousands and all the pleasure which they all receive is returned greatly refined and exalted into the soul that gave it a little furnishes not the means of doing all the liberal things which the liberal devises i xxxii    but he willingly does all the good he can and if there be first a willing mind few are so destitute as not to be able to confer some happiness and what a man confers is not only accepted by god but also approved and inwardly enjoyed by himself according to what he has not according to that he has not   cor viii     the widows two mites bestowed by fervent charity is more than all the gifts which the rich grudgingly or ostntatiously give of their abundance luke xxi        the good man considers all that he has however little it be as bestowed on him by god the consideration gives a flavor to his pleasures of which the wicked can form no conception whatever he possesses he reckons it not little it is a divine gift it derives value from the hand that gave it it is a mark of the notice of the most high but the wicked never think from whom their abundance comes amidst their revellings they dishonor the god by whose bounty their tables are supplied regardless of his operation in enriching them they taste only the shell of their worldly goods they do not penetrate to the kernel they taste none of the exalted pleasures which spring from divine love from fervent gratitude from cheerful trust in an unerring and gracious providence from gladdening consciousness of its continual protection these pleasures the poorest good man derives from his scanty pittance in every one of his comforts he enjoys god he shares in davids raptures i will love thee o lord my strength the lord is my rock and my fortress my god my strength in whom i will trust the horn of my salvation and my high tower psalm xviii   thou lord have made me glad through thy work i will triumph in the works of thy hands psalm

inheritance and of my cup thou maintainest my lot psalm xvi    surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life psalm xxiii     thus by examining the opposite effects of vice and virtue on the temper of the mind which is the necessary foundation even of sensual enjoyment and in particular on the government of our appetites and passions in satisfying which that enjoyment consists and by pointing out the sublime and elevated pleasures which goodness reaps from the right use of worldly things it has been evinced that a little wealth gives the virtuous man purer and greater enjoyment than treasures can yield to the wicked that it gives him likewise more durable enjoyment shall be proved hereafter without virtue what is life a dreary waste a barren desert what is all that the world can bestow but vanity pain and bitterness but to the virtuous poverty is wealth where virtue is not dissatisfaction and wretchedness prevail where virtue dwells there is sincere pleasure and true enjoyment behold the blasting poisonous influence of vice let your regard to interest to present interest urge you to abandon it behold the power of virtue to improve to refine every gratification let selflove determine you to practice it  sermon xvii the advantages of the virtuous for the enjoyment of external good psalm xxxvii    a little that a righteous man has is better than the riches of many wicked that it is better because it gives greater purer and more solid enjoyment has been already evinced that it is likewise better because it gives more durable enjoyment shall be next evinced  the practice of virtue preserves and improves the capacity of enjoyment the practice of wickedness impairs it as every vice tends to unfit us for the true enjoyment of outward things the greater and the more numerous our vices are our enjoyment must be the less they may become so many and so great as to render the amplest possessions perfectly insipid in wicked men vicious habits never fail to make a rapid progress as bodily distemper from small beginnings increases till it prove mortal as one disease neglected is the cause of many others so the vices of the depraved heart daily acquire new strength by indulgence they propagate many more they infect the temper and disorder the constitution with a growing multitude of tormenting passions they root guilt remorse and terror deeper in the soul when the government of the passions is neglected when the authority of conscience is slighted when a sacred regard to the will of god is cast away every temptation will precipitate a man into new sins and every new sin will be the source of many griefs however weak however few his sinful habits be at first however little they disturb his enjoyment they will increase and in the end destroy it whatever good qualities he once possessed they will be gradually choked by his spreading vices they will wither and decay his capacity of enjoyment will be blasted in the same proportion the man who never thinks of rectifying the depravities of his temper but goes on to indulge them without control must at last become abandoned and insusceptible of genuine satisfaction the enjoyment of the good man is in every respect the reverse like his practice it is as the shining light that shines more and more unto the perfect day prove iv     his virtue does not merely secure the continuance of that relish which he has for true pleasure it improves his relish in proportion as itself is by careful practice strengthened and refined all the enemies of his enjyment will be subdued by degrees all inordinate passions will be mortified all corrupt dispositions extirpated all excessive desires curbed all the fountains of inward pain will be dried up his peace of mind will be established all his good principles will be improved by daily progress in holiness he will be more and more possessed of that heavenly serenity of soul which by giving him the full enjoyment of himself prepares him for deriving high and solid satisfaction from every agreeable circumstance in his worldly condition  the health of the body as well as the temper of the mind is requisite for our finding pleasure in outward things there are many vices which render our enjoyment transitory by breaking the health of the body envy says solomon is the rottenness of the bones prove xiv  0  envy discontent peevishness malice pride emaciate and wear out the body rage and fury inflame all its humors sloth and indolence make them to stagnate in languor and infirmity intemperance fills every member with torturing disease enjoyment hastens to a speedy period the opposite virtues are friendly to health a sound heart is the life of the flesh prove xiv  0  and it is only inward rectitude that can bestow it by determined temperance by persevering selfgovernment by the serene tranquillity of conscious virtue the disorders incident to very delicate constitutions have often been prevented from giving any considerable interruption to the enjoyment of a very long life  it is not only by preserving the capacity of enjoyment that virtue prolongs our satisfaction it is not only by impairing this capacity that vice hastens its extinction virtue likewise gives a greater probability than vice for the continuance of those outward things which are the materials and means of enjoyment it must be confessed that worldly goods are of a fleeting and precarious nature riches are not for ever nor does the crown endure to every generation chap xxvii     prosperity like a meteor often vanishes in an instant there is no infallible method of preserving it in continual splendor but what security there can be for its continuance virtue gives and of all things vice tends most directly to extinguish it  the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty prove xxiii     intemperance luxury and the other sensual vices consume the substance like the locusts which eat every herb which grows out of the field a fire devoureth before them and behind them a flame burns exodus x    how much they can consume would be incredible if experience had not often shown that the amplest fortune is quickly exhausted in supporting them at the same time a course of unlawful pleasure eneebles the soul enervates the body sinks both into sloth and ffeminacy and renders a man incapable of either sustaining or repairing his broken fortune so shall thy poverty come swift as one that travalleth and thy want irresistible as an armed man prove vi     by voluptuousness the building decays and through idness of the hands the house drppeth through eccl x     the pampered son of pleasure no longer finds the means of supplying his multiplied nessitis he tumbles down into penury he falls friendless and contemptible unassisted unpitied by all and often most by those who have shared in his riots or become rich by his spoils the temperate has no expensive lusts to make provision for he wastes not the means of enjoyment if he has but a little he bids fair to possess it long his moderation preserves his mind vigorous and his body hardy he is capable of exertion by which he may improve his condition and render his little more  again integrity honesty equity gain a man the confidence of the world and secure to him many advantages for prosperity which naturally arise from that confidence all good men rejoice in his prosperity none but the very worst will endeavor to prevent or to blast his success he fears no prosecution for invaded rights no demand of expensive reparation for wrongs that he has done if in contradiction to the direct tendency of invariable justice poverty should happen to come upon him he is secure from insult he has the sympathy of all and the friendship of the good and he shall be delivered from want in the evil day so true in every sense is solomons maxim he that walks uprightly walks surely but he that perceives his ways shall be known prove x    his real character cannot remain for ever undiscovered every dishonest word and action requires new falsehood and dishonesty to conceal it the longer he goes on the more numerous are the villainies which he must find the means of disguising and the greater is the difficulty of finding these means every moment he is surrounded by manifold hazards of detection and detection is necessarily fatal to his interest he has forfeited the confidence of every heart he lives the object of general distrust in all his actions artifice is suspected the injured demand their own the chastisement of public justice marks him with infamy perhaps he becomes a helpless despised beggar or if he becomes not a beggar he is notwithstanding abject abhorred excluded from all the opportunities of creditable enjoyment he that hastes to be rich considers not that by his haste poverty shall come upon him prove xxviii   the robbery of the wicked shall destroy them because they refuse to do judgment chap xi     but are there not some vices which tend directly to preserve the materials of enjoyment and some virtues which tend directly to dissipate them does not avarice for example labor to secure and increase riches it does but what is the use of riches to the miser of what enjoyment does he render them the means in his possession they are only unemployed unprofitable trash they answer no other end but to minister occasions of anxiety and fretfulness do not generosity hospitality charity beneficence exhaust a mans substance and expose him to penury this is the tendency of prodigality but prodigality is only an awkward mimickry of these amiable virtues their most liberal exertions are regulated by prudence a good man shows favor and lends but he will guide his affairs with discretion ps cxii    he that thus gives unto the poor shall not lack prove xxviii     there is that scatters and yet increases and there is that withholdeth more than is meet but comes to poverty the liberal soul shall be made fat and he that waters shall be watered also himself chap xi        he disperses part of his substance but it is to purchase an ample recompense of inward joy by doing all that his ability permits he secures to himself the good will and the good offices of mankind numbers are indissolubly engaged to him by gratitude and many more by admiration of the benevolence of his heart he shall not fail to receive the means of comfort from others if he have them not of his own he is the good man for whom the apostle supposes that peradventure some would even dare to die romans v     thus from the obvious essential tendencies of virtue and vice we may conclude that the righteous has a much higher probability for the durable enjoyment of his possessions however small than the wicked has for the continuance of his wealth  but the probability is greatly strengthened when we take into the account the providence of god who rules over all our own conduct is far from being the only cause of our good or ill success many things over which we have no power necssarily affect our worldly situation these are all in the hand of god he is the righteous lord who loves righteousness psalm xi   and abhors all iniquity and he will overruled them so as to pull down the wicked except when his prosperity promotes the general good and to establish the righteous except when his prosperity is inconsistent with his own greater happiness signal examples have occurred in every age of gods special providence assisting the natural tendencies of things rendering the miserable consequences of vice more certain and more dreadful and the advantages of virtue greater than the ordinary course of things gave reason for expecting the world has often seen the weakness of the righteous aided by the plain energy of omnipotence bale the power of man and surmount the greatest difficulties it has seen the simplicity of the righteous guided by the divine wisdom elude all the cunning of his enemies and escape from the most imminent dangers it has seen the good man just sinking into an abyss of adversity when lo he has been suddenly upheld by the most unlikely means it has seen the humble and the modest sought for in the most sequestered recesses of obscurity that he might be exalted to honor and set with the princes of his people psalm cxiii    it has seen the treasures of the munificent increase as if they had been replenished by a miracle it has seen the good man raised to the summit of prosperity by those very circumstances which seemed naturally fit for overwhelming him with ruin the young lions do lack and suffer hunger but they that seek the lord shall not want any good psalm xxxiv  0  on the other hand we have sometimes seen the rapacious extortioner and the griping miser reduced to a bit of bread we have often seen the aspiring employ in vain all the profligate arts which ambition dictated we have seen the wicked seated securely as we thought on the pinnacle of prosperity and in an instant an hand which our eye could not perceive has tumbled him down he teemed with flattering schemes for adding thousands to his fortune the moment was come for carrying them into execution when behold the lord blasts them with the breath of his mouth and scatters them as dust is scattered by the wind his closest frauds are detected his most intricate plots are defeated he is snared in the work of his own hands psalm ix     and taken in his own craftiness job v     terrors take hold of him as waters a tempest steals him away in the night the east wind carries him away and he departs and a storm hurleth him out of his place chap xxvii  0     though he heap up silver as the dust and prepare raiment as the day he may prepare it but the just shall put it on and the innocent shall divide the silver ver        the powerful influence of divine providence on the condition both of the righteous and the wicked is beautifully described in many passages of scripture particularly in the psalm from which my text is taken this influence especially when added to the natural tendencies of virtue and vice renders it in the highest degree probable that the righteous shall have more durable possession of the means of enjoyment than the wicked  but suppose them both deprived of them how different are their conditions  the wicked man never had a relish for any other pleasures than such as his wealth could purchase his wealth is gone and all these pleasures have fled along with it winter has overtaken him his summer friends desert him the pinching cold has killed their love they laugh at his calamity his pampered appetites require immense supplies but he can give them none they turn their rage against himself and torture him in the most flourishing state he was often restless and unsatisfied he pined away during the intervals of his pleasures but now he has a perpetual interval nothing remains that can divert his misery for an hour the whole world is become a parched wilderness it contains not a single spring of comfort whence can he look for comfort from the present it is all horror and desolation from the future there he espies more dreadful misery awaiting him from the past that is the fatal cause of all that he feels and of all that he fears his dissatisfaction admits no intermission or relief except he fly to the salutary medicine of bitter repentance till death remove him from it into more insufferable misery  but suppose the righteous man reduced to the extremest poverty god sometimes permits it for wise ends yet his condition is far from being wretched god will raise up friends to him they who love his virtue will rejoice to supply his wants his desires are so moderate that what would be indigence to the wicked is to him a competence the necessaries of life will be sufficient to render his condition more eligible than the affluence of the wicked the same temper which prepares him for deriving the highest enjoyment from earthly things when he has them supports and comforts him in the want of them and in a great measure supplies their place to whatever other pains the good man may be subject he is exempt from the racking pain of guilt to this pain the wicked man is constantly onoxious and he cannot be at all times free from every other the good man may be destitute of other pleasures but of the supreme pleasure of a good conscience no situation can deprive him of this the wicked man is incapable and it is not possible that he should enjoy all other pleasures for they are incompatible in their nature and the depravity of his soul renders them unsatisfying shadows and illusions to the good man a mean opinion of this world and resignation to the providence of god render the want of earthly things easily supportable the consciousness that he received his blessings with gratitude and that he employed them in virtuous offices sustains him in adversity chears him in the midst of tribulations assures him that all things work together for good romans viii    to him in the deepest penury the good man does not so properly lose as vary his pleasures when one source of enjoyment is dried up he draws it from another fountain when the desert denies a spring of water he finds it gushing from the rock if he should even die by famine he dies in the lord and is blessed his works follow him rev xiv     every act of beneficence or compassion which his small possessions ever put it in his power to perform shall be remembered by his savior at the day of judgment a cup of cold water given on a worthy motive shall in no wise lose its reward mat x     it shall be recompensed with everlasting joys judge ye then whether the poor of this world may not be truly rich if they be but virtuous they have the most precious treasures selfenjoyment is their lot heaven is their inheritance god is their portion  in respect of the duration therefore as well as the greatness of his enjoyment a little that a righteous man has is better than the riches of many wicked  but against all that has been said a strong objection seems to arise from experience the wicked it may be urged have actually a greater and the righteous a less dgr of enjoyment than we have all along asserted we admit the fact if the wicked were so totally destitute of enjoyment as we have represented them to be their life would be insupportable but we maintain that when this fact is examined instead of weakening our argument it will confirm it we have hitherto supposed the character to be purely virtuous or purely vicious that by viewing virtue and  separately we might the better discover the genuine tendency of both but every human character is mixed composed of some virtues and some vices and the actual enjoyment of every human creature is affected by each of the ingredients which enter into the composition  on the one hand that good men have not in fact all the enjoyment which virtue naturally tends to produce is owing wholly to vice and to the infirmities which vice has brought upon their souls from vice still lurking in their hearts it proceeds that the bst men are sometimes pyed upon by those painful passions which eat out the sweetness of the most prosperous condition from vice imperfectly subdued it proceeds that their desires are at times immoderate and plunge them into dissatisfaction amidst real abundance from the consciousness of vice which they have committed and of which they are not certain that they have yet obtained forgiveness it proceeds that their enjoyment is sometimes overcast by remorse and doubt and fear if they taste not all the joys of beneficence it must be ascribed to the imperfection of their kind affections or to vicious passions which counteract their exercise preventing their doing all the good that they have it in their power to do if they do not constantly delight themselves in the god of their mercies it is because the weakness of their piety or the influence of sensible things hinders them from preserving a continual sense of him as the giver of all good if they waste their means of enjoyment by frivolous expense or injudicious show or even profuse liberality it is owing to some weakness or imprudence which though compatible with a character virtuous upon the whole is not totally innocent if they sink under the loss of their possessions the cause will be found in some remaining undue attachment to the comforts of easy circumstances or to supposed rank in life which completer virtue would teach them to despise and to sacrifice without a sigh to the will of god in every case the njoyment of the virtuous falls short of what we have described only because their virtues are imperfect and not altogether refined from the alloy of vice being occasioned by this its falling short is so far from being an objection against the tendency of virtue to secure to us the full enjoyment of outward things that it turns out to be a new and irrefragable demonstration of the malignant nature of vice its influence is so subtle and so pernicious that a small mixture of it sophisticates the joys of the most exalted virtue  on the other hand to what is it owing that the wicked have any enjoyment in all that they possess not to their wickedness its real tendency is precisely such as has been described but to this that the very worst of men have some good qualities some imperfect degrees of virtue by preserving some measure of health and soundness in their souls these give them some capacity of enjoyment these set some bounds to their appetites and passions and prevent their desires from becoming absolutely insatiable from reflection upon these they derive some kind of selfapprobation and heartsease their partial goodness dilutes the poison of their many vices it produces both mitigation and intermission of their wretchedness but it cannot prevent their being often inwardly tormented when the world perceives it not it cannot prevent their pleasures from being secretly tainted with the bitterness of corrupt affections and remorse that they are capable of relishing even the pleasures of sense they owe to their virtues that their pleasures are anywise impaired they owe wholly to their vices their virtues slender as they are gain them admission likewise to nobler pleasures very few are so depraved as to exercise no compassion humanity or benevolence many who cannot be reckoned truly virtuous perform acts of generosity or mercy from which they derive great satisfaction they cloth their very luxury and profusion with the garb of social virtue and in this disguise regard them with complacence kind affections are so highly beatifi that even when they are much debased they diffuse serenity upon the soul but their being debased renders it impossible that the pleasure communicated by them to the wicked who exercise them but instinctively and casually can ever rise to an equality with the pure and constant joy of which the uniform exertion of them from principle from conscience from love of goodness is productive to the sincerely virtuous in the wicked these amiable affections being imperfectly formed and mixed with other dispositions odious and disgusting in their nature his character is heterogeneous and monstrous unfit for yielding him upon reflection that full satisfaction and delight by which the consciousness of consistent and growing virtue attunes the good mans soul to every pleasing sentiment whatever enjoyment then the wicked actually have it proves not that vice can ever become conducive to enjoyment it proves only the power of virtue to be so great that the lowest degree the incompletest kind of it can in some measure counteract the tendency of vice to plunge the corrupt and the guilty into perfect misery  thus in every light in which it can be viewed the psamists maxim a little that a righteous man has is better than the riches of many wicked however paradoxical it may seem at first hearing approves itself as a principle of most unquestionable certainty a little gives the good man purer pleasures of sense fuller satisfaction and sublimer joys than the depravity of the wicked permits them to derive from the amplest possessions the good mans relish for enjoyment improves continually the sinners is speedily impaired the conduct of the former is conducive to the preservation of his possessions the conduct of the latter in many ways endangers the loss of them in behalf of the former the divine providence is engaged but the face of the lord is against psalm xxxiv    the latter when riches are once lost the recollection of them can give the wicked no pleasure it wounds his soul with unavailing regret and anguish but if the good mans possessions should forsake him reflection on the use to which he put them comforts him in the day of famine and enlivens his hope of incorruptible treasures in heaven every abatement to which the good mans enjoyment is liable in this mixed state is to be placed to the account of vice and whatever degree of enjoyment the world can convey to the wicked is to be ascribed to their imperfect virtues  if these things be so need we be surprised that so few are really happy is it not rather surprising that so many find life tolerable the generality mistake the place of happiness they seek it only in external goods these they pursue with inextinguishable ardour and indefatigable diligence but they neglect that inward temper of virtue which alone can give them the power of bestowing any happiness if they labor to amass the materials of enjoyment yet by their vicious practice they labor still more assiduously to render themselves incapable of drawing sincere enjoyment from these materials when they feel themselves unsatisfied with what they have they think not that it ought to be imputed to any other cause but that they have no more they fret themselves for the want of what they imagine would fulfill their wishes and secure their satisfaction and to the vanity which is inseparable from sublunary things they foolishly superadd that vexation of spirit which they have it in their own power to avoid they set themselves to acquire what may supply the deficience in their lot but when they have acquired it they find the same deficience still remaining in their enjoyment they study in vain to gratify their desires by satiating them they never attempt to render them susceptible of gratification by governing them when inward uneasiness destroys their relish they have recourse only to palliatives which by giving a momentary relief increase the uneasiness or to provocatives which by irritating the sense wear out its feeling they never think of removing the cause of curing the vice from which their uneasiness ultimately proceeds the generality look for happiness from without therefore they must miss it it can be found only within it depends on the temper of the heart the man must fail of being nourished who seeks his nourishment not in bread but in a stone or in a serpent  again need we be concerned that outward things are distributed so promiscuously or so unequally it is by no means a necessary consequence that enjoyment and uneasiness happiness and misery are likewise distributed promiscuously or unequally it is certain that these are far from being in exact proportion to mens worldly conditions a mans life consists not in the abundance of the things which he possesses luke xii     it may be out of your power to become rich or great the order of nature which god has ordained puts it out of the power of the generality but his ordination is not on that account unrighteous or severe it is sufficient for justifying his appointment it ought to reconcile each of you to his own condition that god has placed real enjoyment within the reach of every man it is in the power of every man by the assistance of gods grace to cultivate a virtuous and holy temper and this is infinitely more important to his enjoyment than the gaudiest distinctions of external state without this nothing external can make him happy with this a very little may the man who is possessed of this can never have reason to envy the most prosperous among the wicked  in ine would we be truly happy let us be virtuous it is not more our duty than it is our interest conscience cannot require it with greater earnestness than selflove enforces it selflove directed by just views of our present happiness though it should look no farther would urge us to fulfill the obligations of virtue and religion at least in all ordinary situations inward worth not only gives the sublimest pleasures peculiar to itself but establishes a temper which prepares us for the completest enjoyment of all other things by vice the best things are converted into poison but things very disagreeable in themselves are rendered pleasant by religion it enables the poor to find satisfaction in the smallest pittance what pleasures then what inexhaustible joys would it not enable the rich and the great to collect from their plentiful possessions by neglecting to excel in goodness how cruelly do they rob their own souls be wise now therefore o ye princes of earth be instructed ye meanest of the people hear this all ye people give ear all ye inhabitants of the world both low and high rich and poor together psalm ii  0 xlix     to all of you the path of happiness is the very same blessed is every one that fears the lord that walks in his ways for thou shall at the labor of thy hands happy shall thou be and it shall be well with thee psalm cxxviii      seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all that is agreeable all that is truly good in the things of this world shall be added unto you mat vi      sermon xviii the power of virtuous resolutions psalm cxix  0  i have sworn and i will perform it that i will keep thy righteous judgments solemn resolutions and vows have always been considered as powerful means of enabling men to abstain from vice and to practice virtue philosophers as well as divines have acknowledged their influence and recommended it to their disciples to form them with care false religions as well as the true religion enjoin them in order to determine their votaries to steadiness in those practices which they inculcate upon them  in common life experience shows that an explicit determined resolution has often very great power in religion experience seems rather to proclaim that the best resolutions are generally weak and ineffectual the one hour men resolve to practice holiness and the next hour they forsake it as if they had never intended to practice it we cannot however fairly conclude from this inconstancy that it is of no avail to form virtuous resolutions in whatever degree the frailty of human nature and the temptations of the world may render them in fact abortive it is evident from their natural tendency that they are among the best means of reformation from sin and of confirmation and improvement in holiness the text will naturally lead us to unfold their tendency and to evince their power i have sworn says david and i will perform it that i will keep thy righteous judgments he had already agreed to keep them he had strengthened his resolution by interposing an oath a solemn vow he would not have formed it with so great care and solemnity if he had not been convinced that it would contribute much to regulate his conduct and the manner of his reflecting upon it shows a deep sense of the obligation which it laid him under to fulfill in this discourse i shall examine the nature of that influence which virtuous resolutions have in fixing our temper and regulating our practice and afterward deduce some practical improvement from the subject  what then is the nature of that influence and power which may justly be ascribed to virtuous resolutions mistake concerning it is one of the principal causes of the inefficacy of such resolutions we expect from them effects which they cannot possibly produce and therefore miss the fruits which might be reaped from the due improvement of them a resolution even the firmest and the strongest cannot directly or immediately extirpate vice and implant holiness it is an internal act of goodness the repetition of it will form a correspondent habit but the only habit correspondent to it is the habit of resolving well virtuous resolutions frequently renewed with sincerity will accustom us to renew them with less reluctance with greater ease and readiness but they cannot by their immediate operation without other means cleanse the heart in an instant from vicious habits and sinful inclinations or rear a virtuous temper a resolution however solmn is only a determination of the will but god has not put our dispositions and our habits so absolutely in our power that we can form or destroy them by merely willing it to become pure and virtuous is a far more arduous task god has appointed it to be our exercise our work our labor throughout this state of trial he has ordained that it should not be accomplished without constant exertion diligence and care his grace could doubtless transform the soul in a moment from wickedness to perfect purity but he has adapted the established methods of his grace to the principles of the human constitution enabling even those to whom it is most liberally communicated to mortify their depraved affections and to acquire the virtues of the christian temper only by slow advances and imperceptible steps in consequence of continual circumspection unremitted activity in welldoing and frequent and fervent prayer as in the natural world the plant is raised to maturity only by a regular process of vegetation in consequence of skilful culture and the nourishing dews of heaven so in the spiritual world the seeds of virtue can be ripened into a solid temper only by a continued course of virtuous practice animated by the power of divine grace it is by exciting us to such practice by prompting us to a series of good actions that resolutions contribute to our improvement and because they excite and prompt us in many ways they are powerful instruments of our improvement    a resolution of virtue lays us under an obligation to be virtuous in the language of scripture it binds the soul with a bond number xxx    a resolution to do any thing though formed with perfect secresy produces an obligation to do it without fulfilling which we cannot thoroughly approve ourselves if we have rashly resolved to do what it is not fit to do we are dissatisfied with our imprudence in resolving if what we resolved upon was proper and worthy to depart from it forces us to despise ourselves for our fickleness and inconstancy and pierces us with a mortifying consciousness that our weakness renders us contemptible in the eyes of the world if you know a person whose character in common life is that he seldom understands his own mind that he alters his intention almost every hour that he never keeps one purpose so long as to have time to execute it that he resolves and promises but quickly changes sides that he cannot be depended upon in any business of moment you know likewise that it is far from an estimable character that it is universally despicable that it is incompatible with every degree of a manly spirit to carry this wavering and unsteadiness into religion is far more censurable the importance of religion and the baseness of living in the violation of its laws prevent the breach of religious resolution from being regarded as a contemptible imbecility they render it a detestable crime to depart from evil and do good psalm xxxiv   is the proper business of man to resolve upon it is our highest wisdom it is necessary to our present peace and to our future happiness in proportion to its importance is the baseness and the igominy of inconstancy in pursuing this course after we have resolved upon it having decreed the only path of life having determined to walk in it can any levity be so degrading can any irresolution be so disgraceful as to be allured by trifling pleasures or advantages or prevailed upon by momentary pains to desert this path and to persist in wandering from it though we meet disquit and disappointment at every step and know that without a speedy return the end must be everlasting death after vows of such high importance of so interesting tendency it is a snare it is full of danger to make enquiry prove xx     once to admit the thought of retracting them can you know yourselves guilty of it without confusion and selfabhorrence can you be guilty of it and not feel yourselves justly abominable in the sight of god when thou vowest a vow unto god defer not to pay it or he has no pleasure in fools eccles v    by thus laying us under an obligation the violation of which must produce a mortifying sense of baseness and demerit virtuous resolutions cannot fail to promote steady perseverance in virtue  a virtuous resolution impels us to virtue by rendering it an object and aim to us let a pursuit be no wise interesting in itself yet when we have determined to engage in it we are no longer indifferent this very determination is sufficient to impress it upon us as an end which we must now attain religion is supremely interesting to every human creature though he should never resolve to practice it but giddiness or the avocations of worldly care hinder many from thinking of it as their concern as a business with which they ought to charge themselves inattention to our concern in the practice of religion is the most general cause of the neglect of it against that inattention the most direct and efficacious antidote is a serious deliberate firm resolution that religion shall be the business of our lives this sets it in our eye as what must be practiced as what must not be on any account neglected as the center in which all our thoughts and views and exertions must ultimately terminate this gives the whole soul a prevailing and habitual bias to it and predisposes us to resist every temptation to vice and to embrace every opportunity for virtue of these native consequences of a fixed determination david gives many bright delineations from his own experience i have sworn that i will keep thy righteous judgments therefore i will perform it my soul is continually in my hand yet do i not forget thy law the wicked have laid a snare for me yet i erred not from thy precepts thy testimonies have i taken as an heritage for ever i have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes always even unto the end ps cxix  0    0          i have chosen the way of truth what was the effect thy judgments have i laid before me as the model of my whole conduct i have stuck unto thy testimonies i will run the way of thy commandments ver  0        such are the genuine sentiments and workings of a soul under the power of a strong purpose of universal holiness it is natural for those who have never resolved on virtuous practice to waver between good and evil but a firm resolution fixes the will in the choice of good and as long as it is thus fixed how can our actions which are the immediate effects of the exertion of the will be evil till the resolution is decayed or forgotten we cannot give full consent to any vice it will be not only a constant monitor of our obligation to adhere steadfastly to virtue but likewise a constant incitement to fulfill the obligation and a counterpoise to the power of sin temptations solicit in the same manner as formerly depraved appetites and passions crave their wonted indulgence but they find a strong resistance to their impulse they find the will determined on the contrary course they find the soul bent to perseverance in it before they can prevail they must conquer this resistance and before they can conquer it resolution must have lost its force the man who remains deeply impressed with his resolution to obey all gods laws whenever he feels himself in danger of a transgression readily checks himself by recollecting that it is inconsistent with the conduct which he has resolved to pursue to every effort of irregular inclination he can oppose the firm determination of the will to every temptation to sin he is prepared to answer i am resolved against it can it fail to be a great advantage to have the heart thus steadily turned to virtue and set upon the practice of it i resolutions regarding common life the advantage is universally acknowledged and experienced we scruple not to dissuade a man from many things which he designs but when we know that he is absolutely determined on any point we confess it to be in vain to endeavor to dissuade him and why should not resolutions in religion have equal influence only because we are not careful to render them equally firm  from the habitual bent to virtue as its object and its aim which an explicit resolution of pursuing it impresses on the soul there arises another great advantage if it were possible that a man should employ himself in virtuous actions without any previous resolution of being virtuous yet these actions could improve only the particular virtue of which they were immediate exertions acts of abstinence would improve the habit of temperance but could add no strength to the habits of justice benevolence and piety acts of justice or of charity would promote a just or charitable spirit but could contribute nothing toward forming the other parts of a holy temper his progress would resemble the imperfect operations of human art in which only one member of the work is shaped or polished at once the other members remaining in the mean time rude and without form while he were intent on improving one of the virtues of a good character he could make no improvement in any of the other virtues but when a firm resolution has devoted us to the practice of universal holiness it gives the soul a fixed bias and permanent propensity to every part of holiness we apply ourselves to every duty which there is an opportunity of performing as a branch of the general plan which we have determined to execute and in consequence of this by performing it we carry forward that whole plan every good action undertaken in accomplishment of a resolution of universal holiness whatever be the particular nature of that action strengthens the resolution confirms the general bias resulting from it and by doing so renders us better disposed not only to the virtue from which it directly proceeds but to all the virtues which come within the compass of our resolution we advance in the improvement of our hearts in a manner similar to the perfect operation of god who in every one of his works forms the rudiments of all the parts at once and by one process extending its influence to them all rears them together to perfection firmly resolved to do whatever we know to be our duty we acquire the beginnings of all the virtues at once by every good action of our lives we raise them all to a greater degree of vigor we are secure against the danger of resting satisfied with partial goodness  thus a resolution of holiness sincerely formed and carefully preserved has great power to render us holy by fixing holiness as an end which we must pursue by presenting it to our view as our proper business by predisposing the mind alike to all the parts of it and by rendering the exertions of every virtue the means of cultivating universal goodness    a virtuous resolution contributes to our practicing virtue by rendering the practice of it agreeable to us this is the natural consequence of that habitual bias which resolution impresses on the soul many things nowise painful in themselves become disagreeable to us merely because we undertake them with reluctance because they run counter to our present bent and inclination the very same things will be accomplished with ease and even prosecuted with pleasure at another time when they are undertaken of choice and coincide with inclination a resolution renders that our choice which is necessary for fulfilling it removes our backwardness to engage in it prevents the uneasiness which this backwardness would occasion in performing it and makes it to fall in with the prevailing propensity of the soul in common life a thousand things appear impracticable when we first think of them which nevertheless we execute with facility as soon as a firm resolution has set our hearts upon them a determined mind can support the hardest labor and surmount the greatest difficulties with alacrity and satisfaction irregular inclinations and corrupt affections render us averse to the restraints which religion imposes on them we engage in it with reluctance and therefore every step is difficult and unpleasant a hearty resolution if it cannot destroy our reluctance provides a counterbalance to it it determines our fixed choice to holiness it makes us habitually solicitous to become holy it renders us intent on practicing it we enter into it wih spirit we exert ourselves with vigor and we feel pleasure in the exertion when a temptation occurs it excites the vicious passion to which it is addressed this passion produces an aversion to the virtue which opposes it but the general determination to all virtue which resolution has impressed combats this aversion reconciles us to the restraint of inclination renders it an easy yoke mat xi  0  to which we submit with cheerfulness and which we persist in bearing with alacrity and joy david had resolved i will keep thy statutes ps cxix   what was the effect with my whole heart have i sought thee i have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies as much as in all riches i will delight myself in thy statues i will not forget thy word ver  0        he had said i am thy servant ver      the consequence was therefore i love thy commandments above gold yea above fine gold therefore i esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right and i hate every false way ps cxix          what we hate we shall willingly employ care to shun what we love we shall joyfully take pains to obtain    a virtuous resolution has great influence on our improvement by putting us on the diligent use of all the means necessary for fulfilling the resolution we should reckon it labor lost to bstow a thought on the means of acquiring what we have no intention to pursue it may be very valuable but w have never proposed it to ourselves as an and to what purpose then enquire how it may be attained but as soon as we have determined on the end our thought is naturally turned to the proper means of promoting it the end is so intimately connected with the means subservient to it that while that continues in our view no effort is strong enough to prevent all attention to these it renders us eagerly inquisitive about them it suggests them to our notice it forces us to dwell upon them it makes us forward to apply them and preserves us active and indefatigable in the application of them such being the acknowledged tendency of a fixed resolution the resolution of virtue cannot fail to direct our solicitous concern to the means of becoming virtuous wherewith shall a young man cleanse his way psal cxix    is the question which it impelled david to propose with earnestness and it will lead every man who has formed it with equal sincerity often to propose the same question to himself with the like earnestness and to enforce his attention to it with the greatest care the means of holiness it is not difficult to discover they are clearly revealed to us careful study of the divine law fervent prayer for the divine assistance circumspect vigilance against evil unwearied diligence in every good action which opportunity permits these are the direct and immediate instruments of virtuous improvement that a virtuous resolution instigates to the use of these almost every man may be convinced from his own experience for there is scarcely any man who has never formed one good resolution recollect then for some little time after you had formed it did you not feel some disposition to attend to what you ought to do in order to fulfill it to implore the grace of god for your assistance in keeping it to be upon your guard against what tempted you to the violation of it to exert yourselves in some virtuous actions for which your situation gave an opportunity perhaps the disposition was of short continuance with the generality it is alas of very short continuance but if it lasted only for a day it is sufficient for ascertaining the natural tendency and the proper influence of virtuous resolution but if this be its genuine tendency what reason can be assigned why you are not always in this good disposition but that you suffer your resolutions to wear off and lose their power did you by frequently renewing them preserve them in undecayed vigor they would operate continually in the same manner and with equal efficacy it is plain from the experience of the saints david never recollects his holy purposes or thinks of the subject of them but they prompt him to use some of the means of holiness thou have commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently o that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes psalm cxix      i will keep thy statutes o forsake me not utterly o let me not wander from thy commandments thy word have i hid in mine heart that i might not sin against thee ver    0      i have said that i would keep thy words i entreated thy favor with my whole heart be merciful unto me according to thy word i thought on my ways and turned my feet unto thy testimonies i made haste and delayed not to keep thy commandments ver      0  depart from me ye evildoers for i will keep the commandments of my god ps cxix       i said i will take heed to my ways that i sin not with my tongue that i might guard against temptation i was dumb with silence i held my peace ps xxxix       v finally virtuous resolution instigates us to virtue by suggesting the motives to it keeping them in our view and fixing our attention on them when a man is once determined he not only represents to himself in the strongest light all the reasons which moved him to determine but is at pains to search out reasons for adhering to his resolution which never occurred to him when he was forming it he will not be diverted from the execution of it by much stronger arguments than would have been sufficient to prevent his entering into it he is ingenious in finding topics to justify it he is anxious to confute every objection against his persisting in it and if the resolution happen to be improper he will often satisfy himself with the poorest sophisms and the silliest evasions rather than abandon it what effect is then so great as not to be justly expected from a settled resolution to practice holiness while it remains in force it will lead us to meditate often upon all the motives to holiness it will keep them perpetually in our view but they cannot be perpetually in our view without exciting us to perpetual diligence in holiness they are so weighty and of such eternal consequence that nothing but inattention to them can prevent their governing the world they are derived from every topic which can interest us they are addressed to every principle which can actuate us duty honor utility enjoyment in life and comfort in the hour of death present peace and eternal happiness conscience gratitude hope and fear all conspire in urging us to holiness before their combined force all the most specious pleas of vice must vanish in this one psalm in what profusion are they suggested in what striking lights are they placed with what force and with what efficacy does david inculcate them upon himself i remind you only of a few examples blessed are the undefiled in the way who walk in the law of the lord they also do no iniquity then shall i not be ashamed when i have respect unto all thy commandments the law of thy mouth is better uno me than thousands of gold and silver all thy commandments are faithful unless thy law had been my delights i should then have perished in mine affliction i will never forget thy precepts for with them thou have quickened me they are ever with me thy testimonies are wonderful therefore does my soul keep them thy testimonies that thou have commanded are righteous and very faithful thy word is very pure therefore thy servant loves it thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness and thy law is the truth thy commandments are my delights thou have founded them for ever great peace have they which love thy law and nothing shall offend them lord i hoped for thy salvation and done thy commandments psalm cxix                                0                      by rendering such views of virtue familiar by keeping them continually present to the mind a resolution if it be but vigorous and steady must urge us to virtue with a force almost irresistible  thus i have endeavored to describe the power of virtuous resolutions and to point out the sources from which it is derived by producing an obligation which we must fulfill in order to avoid the humiliating sense of inconsistency of character by fixing holiness as an end which we must pursue and impressing an habitual bias to it by conquering our reluctance to the practice of it and rendering it agreeable by prompting us to the diligent use of all means of improvement in it and by forcing all the strongest incitements to it continually into our thoughts they turn the heart to holiness collect all the strength of the soul in this one design and instigate support assist and invigorate all its efforts to accomplish it the practical improvement of this subject is obvious    since virtuous resolutions are such powerful instruments of virtuous practice and improvement we ought to form them with the greatest sincerity firmness and care the neglect of this is one of the principal causes of the corruption of the world men go on in wickedness because have they never resolved to abandon it they are at no pains to be virtuous because they have never seriously thought of it for a mans living in sin it is not necessary that he make a formal choice of it it is enough that he has not resolved against it the strength of temptation and the power of corrupt passions will precipitate him into it but for our practicing holiness for our persisting in it notwithstanding all its difficulties notwithstanding the depressions of infirmity the impulse of corruption and the allurements of temptation it is indispensibly necessary that we devote ourselves to it and engage ourselves in it by a fixed choice and resolution this is the point from which steady virtue always takes its rise in those who are recovered to virtue after some time spent in open vice the resolution to change their course must be very deliberate formal and explicit but even when men have by the blessing of god on a religious education been earliest and most imperceptibly initiated into virtue their virtue is owing to a real choice of it instilled from the first and habitually preserved and acted upon if our best resolutions cannot secure perfect purity and immovable constancy shall we conclude that resolution has no power the conclusion would contradict the plainest experience of human life we should conclude only that our religious resolutions are too feeble that the difficulties of religion and the weakness and corrupt propensities of man require their being formed with the greatest seriousness and raised to the greatest vigor and maintained in unexhausted force if our goodness be defective if our sins be many notwithstanding all our pains to enter into and to inculcate upon ourselves resolutions of universal holiness we must have been void of goodness and profligate in sin if we had never made one resolution to the contrary it were folly not to avail ourselves of the great advantages which resolution gives for uniform and steadfast virtue if it be undertaken early it will prevent a great deal of corruption and labor and remorse and misery it will spread the happiest influence over all the periods of life when we are capable of choosing our occupation for this world it is high time that we make the more important choice of our occupation for the other world if we are designed for eternity and if without virtue it is impossible to be happy in eternity we cannot too speedily or with too great deliberation and seriousness devote ourselves to the pursuit of all that is true and venerable and just and pure and lovely phil iv    this is the plan and model of life which every man ought to prescribe to himself which he should be determined to observe and execute alone and in company in prosperity and adversity in every possible situation christianity demands it from all its professors it requires it to be done in a manner the fittest for adding to its efficacy it has instituted two sacraments for the purpose it has enforced the frequent observance of one of them by making it the subject of christs dying precept it has provided that as many as have not cast off all regard to the voice of their expiring savior shall form and often renew the firm resolution of universal holiness with the utmost deliberation and solemnity with their souls for a considerable time kept intensely bent upon it with a bright display full in their view of every motive to the exact fulfillment of it with their faith and honor for the execution plighted to their fellow christians in a striking act of immediate worship which gives it all the authority and energy of a religious vow and is an appointed and therefore a powerful means of drawing down abundant showers of celestial grace to nourish and invigorate it and to raise from it the precious fruits of righteousness    having sincerely resolved to practice universal holiness let us diligently and faithfully fulfill the resolution from the power of resolution this may reasonably be expected we daily find men unalterably constant in resolutions of small importance we find them inflexibly obstinate in evil purposes strange that we should be irresolute only in that in which it is of supreme importance to be resolute and unmovable that in religion alone we suffer the force of resolution to be subdued by every foe by allowing it to languish without producing its effect by neglecting to act upon it by fainting in the accomplishment of it we frustrate one of the most powerful instruments which religion contains for the reformation of our lives and the improvement of our hearts and we render ourselves in a great measure incapable of being profited by any of the rest excellent as it is it is but a means of holiness it derives all its value from its subservience to this end it is labor lost if it fail of promoting it it is only for the sake of the execution that the formation of holy purposes is enjoined god will not accept of purposes instead of practice he will not be satisfied with inefficient promises his voice is vow and pay unto the lord your god psalm lxxvi     true holiness is a stable and permanent temper a continued and persevering practice if y continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed john viii    but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him heb x     look to yourselves therefore that ye lose not those things which ye have wrought but that ye receive a full reward   john       from what has been said we may learn to judge whether or not our virtuous resolutions be properly formed and properly maintained you see what effects they ought to produce they promote not our sanctification by an instantaneous charm from every lapse you have not reason to suspect either their sincerity or their permanence if they fortify your sense of obligation if they keep you habitually attached to holiness as the one thing needful luke x     if they strenuously resist the corrupt propensities of the soul if they prompt you to use the means of improvement with uniform diligence if they render you forward to recollect and to dwell upon the motives to virtue they have not been formed in vain these are the energies by which they gradually and slowly mould the heart to holiness continue to cherish them and by the same energies they will at last render you complete but whenever they cease to produce these effects they cease to act they cease to be remembered you must form anew you must urge them upon your souls with greater vigor you must excite yourselves with greater earnestness to yield to their influence and to fulfill them be not weary in welldoing   thessalonians iii     hold that fast which thou have that no man take thy crown rev iii      sermon xix the house of mourning more improving than the house of feasting eccles vii   it is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting all the varieties that can occur in human life fall under two general heads prosperity and adversity some spend the greatest part of their time in one of these states and some in the other but every man has experience of both both may be improved so as to promote the great end of life our education for eternity for each inculcates peculiar lessons and puts us upon congruous exercises which tend to form our hearts to virtue and to produce such habits as may prepare us for the enjoyment of pure and perfect happiness but adversity has been always found the more successful teacher of the two its discipline is indeed severe desirous of present ease we naturally fly from it and when it overtakes us we use every endeavor to escape from its grasp as soon as possible its instructions are however so important that the person who estimates them justly will reckon its future salutary effects sufficient motives to patience and resignation under the present evil  if nevertheless a method could be discovered by which we might obtain the benefits of adversity without being subjected to its pains a method by which the prosperous without relinquishing their prosperity might learn to steer their course through life with that sedateness which results from afflictions well improved who would be so inconsiderate so indifferent to his own greatest good as not eagerly to embrace it who would not rejoice in the opportunity of becoming wise and virtuous at so cheap a rat yet this very opportunity is every day prsted to men and every day neglected by them observation of the afflictions of others has the same tendency with experience of our own so much is our nature formed for social connections that the condition of others becomes in some degree our own and fills our hearts either with ympathetic joy or with compassionate grief the happiest of mankind may as often as they please contemplate the calamities of their neighbors and from the well directed contemplation of them derive almost the same advantages as from bearing calamity themselves but the very causes which render us unwilling to be ourselves afflicted often prevent our fixing our attention on the afflictions of other men they depress our spirits they excite uneasy feelings they occasion present dissatisfaction the sorrow indeed which they produce is not pure or unallayed by the wise and gracious constitution of human nature there is an attraction in distress which engaging our benevolence draws us toward those who labor under it even when we can only commiserate but have it not in our power to bring them relief yet scenes of gaiety have often force enough to divert us from hearkening to this propensity their fascination overcomes the attraction of distress they elevate our hearts they dilate them with cheerful sensations they introduce a train of pleasant emotions they give present satisfaction and therefore we think it more eligible to witness them to associate with such as revel in them than to converse with the children of sorrow and to fix a steady eye upon the calamities of human life when these compel us to behold them when their striking circumstances or our own relation to the persons whom they have befallen irresistibly arrest our notice we too often view them but instinctively we gaze upon them and shed a tear but we indulge none of those useful reflections which would have a permanent influence upon our temper and our conduct if such reflections happen to arise spontaneously we quickly banish them as intruders we shrink back from the seriousness which they would introduce and seek relief in mirth and dissipation this is to prefer the satisfaction of the present moment to the lasting improvement of the heart it may be more agreeable to view the glitter of prosperity and to partake in the laughter and levity of the prosperous but it is incomparably more useful to enter into the sorrows of the afflicted to ponder the evils of life and to pursue the thoughts which a serious view of them inspires this is the judgment which the wise man pronounces in my text it is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting for that he means considering the distresses of others not enduring our own is evident from what he adds for that is the end of all men and the living will lay it to his heart he has particularly in his eye the last evil incident to man he points at the benefit that the living may derive from meditation on the instances of mortality which surround them and in which affection often gives them a melancholy interest but we need not suppose that he excludes the benefit which wise spectators may receive from considering other evils in which likewise they are concerned only by sympathy with the sufferers  solomon was deeply skilled in human life he was acquainted with all the circumstances by which it is diversified he understood the nature and the tendency of all the events which fill it up and he had learned to measure the usefulness of things not by their fitness to gratify inclination or to give immediate pleasure but by their efficacy in forming the heart and promoting spiritual improvement on this principle it is that his wisdom guided by gods unerring spirit declares that to go to the house of mourning to be willingly and familiarly conversant with scenes of sorrow and suffering is better than to go to the house of feasting to be engrossed by objects of festivity jollity pomp or splendor to the gayer part of mankind to those in every station who give a loose to levity and thoughtlessness this maxim will doubtless seem a paradox but it is a truth of the most unquestionable certainty and the most capital importance it is better because it is more useful and it is more useful because it is likely to have a more beneficial influence on our temper and our conduct because it is more conducive to our religious and moral culture and our real happiness that in this decisive point of view the house of mourning is preferable to the house of feasting i undertake to evince by a comparison of both in respect of the general temper and disposition which they form in respect of the sentiments which they suggest and in respect of the affections which they draw out into exercise and render habitual  first as to the general temper which they form to go to the house of feasting tends to produce levity and dissipation but to go to the house of mourning fixes the soul in a temper of sedateness seriousness and composure  a very little recollection will convince you that a run of good success a train of gay avocations or a course of amusements seldom fail to render men in some degree light and volatile thoughtless and unreflecting they leave neither inclination nor capacity for the labors which attend a close application to any subject they benumb the understanding enervate the affections relax all the powers of the soul and throw it into an insignificant flutter the jollity which scenes of festivity excite is of a dissolving debilitating nature it is a swelling rather than an elevation of heart it is a fever not a brisk and healthful circulation it is apter to divert us from virtuous offices altogether than to render us cheerful and active in performing them intoxicated with it we are too giddy to be able to ponder the moment of our actions too much off our guard to elude the deceitfulness of sin and the insinuations of temptation too inconsiderate for embracing opportunities of doing good and too effeminate for exerting ourselves in order to improve them i said of laughter it is mad and of mirth what does it eccl ii    it yields no manly enjoyment and it unfits us for virtue and religion the improvident unthinking temper which it fosters is one of the principal causes of those vices which have overrun the world it is only in the sedate and recollected soul that virtue can flourish and grow up to vigor and maturity  this is the very character which attention to distress is directly calculated to form distress is indeed a gloomy object when the unprincipled or the ungoverned mind first enters into the contemplation of it it may be sunk into melancholy raised into violent agitations of grief or broken into peevishness and discontent very unfriendly to virtue as opposite to its benign exertions as even the profusest mirth and levity can be to the solemnity of its duties but if the soul be at all prepared for meeting the shocks of sorrow familiarity with the sufferings of the afflicted will produce no more than a moderate concern a necessary degree of seriousness it will not lift up the passions into tempestuous billows it will only collect them into sobriety of mind a proper sense of the calamities incident to man swallows up all trivial emotions and occupies the whole soul with one important feeling it becomes recollected in itself it acquires an attentive frame it is well disposed to caution circumspection and consideration it is this happy temper that attunes the heart to virtue the man in whom it prevails is always solicitous to act aright and always capable of acting aright he is fit for selfgovernment steadiness and consistency of conduct he has a defense against every temptation to sin for he is enough master of himself to perceive its tendency and to detect its insignificance he can calmly examine the value of every object and canvas the claim of every vice in vain does fancy throw a false coloring over it he is proof against the deceit his reason is awake to discern the artificial varnish and his conscience is active to raise a detestation of its natural deformity he is prepared for despising all those slight allurements which seduce the thoughtless from the diligent practice of holiness and from persevering efforts to reach the perfection of their nature  such is the general temper to which we shall be formed by going to the house of mourning and when we consider this temper as fundamental to religion as essential to purity blamelessness constancy and uniformity of character this alone is sufficient to constrain us however much inclination may oppose the concession in our judgment in our conscience to acknowledge that it is far better to visit the comfortless abodes of poverty and pain of disease and death forbidding as they seem to be than to frequent places of the gayest entertainment the loudest mirth or the most inviting and agreeable amusements the heart the delight of the wise is the house of mourning and that only of fools in the house of mirth eccl vii     secondly to go to the house of mourning is better than to go to the house of feasting in respect of the sentiments which it suggests the latter diverts us from meditation on any subjects of a serious or important nature the former forces into our view the most important the most deeply interesting subjects  gaiety does not penetrate the heart so deeply as concern but it in some sense engrosses it more entirely it in a great measure ulls the thinking powers asleep suspends the exercise of thought and unhinges the train of our ideas it breaks the bands by which our present perceptions draw others into our view it annihilates the gale which carries us forward in a regular direction from sentiment to sentiment the mind is like a ship becalmed incapable of motion or it is the sport of light and unsteady breezes shifting every moment from point to point it can make no progress it can only roll in its present place it cannot advance in any course of regular meditation gay ideas can introduce none but gay ideas their agreeable titillation indisposes us for every thought except what regards the enjoyment of the present or the anticipation of a future amusement all those religious principles which can either restrain from vice or instigate to virtue studiously avoid the circles of levity and dissipation if they should happen to enter into them they would be received with coldness or turned out as impertinent intruders  but all that we meet with in the house of mourning naturally suggests many of the most important ideas and the sadness of heart which it inspires prepares us for feeling all their force the contemplation of distress not only inclines us to attention but calls up the most useful objects on which we can bestow our attention it almost constrains us to recollect and to ponder some of those awful truths and awakening considerations which are the strongest motives to the right discharge of every duty when we enter by sympathy into the sorrows of others though the heart embraces the painful sensation which they have produced and enjoys a sweet satisfaction in it yet it avoids clinging too closely to it it runs spontaneously into such views as may relieve or vary its uneasiness without extinguishing the soft emotion in which it is involved both our present disposition and the objects which engage our notice lead us naturally into such tracks of thinking as are analogous and congruous to seriousness and concern it is only from such that we can find relief should gay ideas be accidentally forced upon us instead of mitigating our sorrow they would imbitter it their continuance would render it insupportable we should run eagely into graver reflections as the only means of alleviating it sorrow creates a sort of appetite for pain it causes us to reject cheerfulness with loathing and disgust it delights in being indulged it is more effectually soothed by the serious thoughts to which we are prompted by itself and for this reason it determines us to dwell upon them there is not a single species of distress in which we can observe our fellowmen our neighbors or our friends that does not naturally lead us to useful meditations i can give but a very few examples  when you cast your eyes upon the poor when you visit the haunts of indigence  and how can you avoid it if you do not abduately refuse to look upon them  for they abound in every street they meet you at every corner  you must be totally lost to sensibility of heart if some profitable thoughts concerning their condition concerning your own concerning the ways of god do not rise in your minds who has made so great a difference between that tattered beggar and tyself can thou justly claim as great a superiority in worth as in prosperity why then art thou thus distinguished the rules by which god dispenses penury and abundance pain and pleasure seem to be unequal their principles are wholly undiscoverable by the weakness of our powers but if he be wise and good thus irregularly distributed they cannot be for recompense they must be only for trial our concern must be only to improve them not to enjoy them if we acquiesce in enjoying them we lose them it is their very nature to perish with the using col ii     many in their life time have received their good things and are afterward tormented while they who received evil things are comforted luke xvix     we are not the proprietors we are but the stewards of the good things which we possess to fix our wordly condition belongs to providence to behave well whatever our condition be and by behaving well to secure a state of everlasting blessedness is all that can belong to us if any of you neglect this ye shall see many whose poverty you despised or pitied in the kingdom of heaven and you yourselves thrust out chap xiii      when it is by having been tumbled down from ease and affluence that your neighbor or your friend is languishing in poverty the reverse which he has suffered enforces and multiplies our serious reflections we feelingly perceive the vanity the uncertainty the worthlessness of all temporal things is it for a small pittance of these that so many sacrifice their innocence pollute their hearts and wound their consciences can it be but the extremity of folly to transgress any duty for the sake of what may vanish in a moment can it really be difficult to acquire that disengagement from them which will prepare us for devoting ourselves heartily to religion shall pride or presumption rise in our prosperity and idly boast my mountain stands strong i shall never be moved psalm xxx      if god but hide his face we are troubled psalm xxx      how awful is his providence it puts up and casts down whomsoever it pleases nothing remains for us but to adore it with reverence and to receive its appointments with submission or with gratitude  you often see the bed of sickness you observe not a stranger but the neighbor whom you esteem the friend whom you love languishing upon it is it possible at that time to restrain your thoughts from the most solemn themes how precarious is human life how many disorders are incident to this mortal body the least of which can render every enjoyment insipid and life itself a burden how little is it worth our while to plod and sweat and drudge for what can profit us only in the present world impossible that this fleeting chequered scene can be the whole of mans existence has god made all men in vain psalm lxxxix     has he not formed them for a state of purer and more durable felicity is it not a debasing of the dignity of our reasonable powers to use them only as the instruments of pursuing unsatisfying unstable transitory trifles for extinguishing the heat of a fever for allaying the anguish of the stone for slackening the pace of a consumption how impotent are all the titles and treasures and dignities of earth the interests of the eternal world must be the only object the virtuous the holy exercises which are subservient to them must be the only proper sphere of an immortal spirit exiled into a body which is liable to so manifold infirmities and distresses it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god heb x     far beyond the possibility of being numbered are the ways in which god can execute his displeasure on those who incur it by their disobedience who knows the power of his anger psalm xc     if the slight disorders of our present state can render us incapable of satisfaction if they can turn existence into a curse during their continuance if even the imaginary evils which a disordered fancy presents to view if the unsubstantial specter which rise in a moment of delirium can pierce the heart with real anguish and overwhelm it with insupportable terrors what must that tribulation and anguish romans ii   be which shall hereafter come upon every soul of man that does evil romans ii    from enduring that punishment which for the vindication of his authority and laws the almighty will in the completion of his moral government inflict on the obstinately and incorrigibly wicked what creature can bear it what heart recoils not with horror from the thought of it will we venture on any action that can expose us to it warned by so many afflictions distresses and calamities which render this world a land of sorrow though god has caused them to come only for correction or for mercy job xxxvii     will we not fly from that distress and anguish which he will send in indignation for the perdition of the irreclaimable a single moment of which can outweigh a combination of all temporal evils convinced by what we see around us of how much misery human nature is susceptible can we want motives to labor for admission into that happy state into which no disease no pain no disappointment of desire can ever enter in which there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying rev xxi     we every day observe instances of mortality without emotion without one grave reflection their frequency has made us callous to all impression from them but when it is a revered parent a darling child or a beloved friend that has breathed out his last the most unthinking finds it no longer in his power to remain insensible earthly things shrink into nothing every sublunary enjoyment seems to be annihilated the whole world is become a dreary waste thoughts force themselves upon the giddist which if they were but suffered to be permanent could not fail to break every undue attachment to the objects of sense and to ix our whole hearts on things spiritual and eternal  by being witnesses of distress thinking persons must be put upon reflections of this kind and when their tendency is so salutary will we not in contempt of present gratification confess that it is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting  thirdly it is likewise better in respect of the affections which it cherishes to go to the house of feasting gives exercise to almost no good affections but to go to the house of mourning draws forth into exercise and by exercising improves those affections which constitute the sum of virtue sorrow is better than laughter for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better eccl vii     it is only by being exerted that good affections can become habitual what gives no scope to their exertion can contribute nothing to form them into a settled temper a succession of gaieties and amusements can strengthen scarcely any disposition in our nature but levity and the love of trifles for it gives exercise to no other if it appears to be the cment of society and the bond of good will and friendship the appearance alas is generally deceitful under this fair pretense it often fosters only pride vanity and ostentation on the one hand and flattery false professions and mean compliances on the other hand the dissipated jovial companion seldom excels either in the sensibility or in the activity of benevolence  but a feeling attention to the distresses of human life incident to ourselves and lying heavy on some of those who are connected with us naturally cherishes many of the most important virtues a suffering friend sometimes exhibits an attractive example of patience magnanimity and resignation seeking unto god and unto god committing his cause job v    his conduct expresses in the most striking manner the pious sentiments of job shall we receive good at the hand of god and shall we not receive evil chap ii  0  though he slay me yet will i trust in him he also shall be my salvation chap xiii        amidst the heaviest afflictions belonging to this mortal state he retains fervent piety to the god who severely yet mercifully corrects him unengrossed by all that he endures he continues interested in the concerns of his friends warm in his love to them and his solicitude for their welfare like to the savior of mankind who throughout the agonies of his passion preserved an ardent zeal and expressed earnest desires for the good of the human race such behavior under the mighty hand of god commands the veneration of the heart and urges us to collect the whole vigor of our souls that we may become capable of imitating it  if on the other hand we see one of our fellow creatures fainting under his distresses unable to sustain them with christian fortitude we may improve his misbehaviour for our own instruction it is not difficult to discover the causes of his weakness we behold exemplified in him the ill consequences of the neglect of selfgovernment the painful effects of immoderate attachment to worldly pleasures or possessions the misery which springs from the want of faith and confidence in god or the enfeebling dejecting influence of conscious guilt and by the alarming exemplification we are loudly warned before adversity shall overtake ourselves to alter our conduct to reform our temper to root out from our hearts whatever can increase its bitterness  but whatever be the behavior of those whose afflictions we contemplate the very contemplation of the afflictions themselves has a powerful tendency to improve us in benevolence piety resignation patience distress sets any of our fellowcreatures in a very interesting point of view it demands for him a peculiar degree of love and tenderness to him that is afflicted pity should be showed from his friend job vi     with a voice of persuasion irresistible to the sensibility of every heart that is not totally depraved his affliction cries have pity upon me have pity upon me o ye my friends for the hand of god has touched me job xix     while the distress of others grieves us it attaches us to them by a strong affection it forces upon our recollection every circumstance in their former situations or in their characters that can confirm or enliven our affection we forget or find out excuses for those faults in their behavior which once provoked our anger or our indignation our whole souls are melted into complacence and benevolence by being often in this manner awakened and exerted in the softest feelings the kind affections are prepared for rising and actuating us on less moving occasions the heart is trained to love fitted for being touched by every agreeable quality and every endearing relation and disposed to flow out in beneficence in deeds of charity and in acts of generosity as often as opportunities occur distress puts it in our power to improve our kind affections not only by indulging their inward workings but also by putting them forth into act we can often assist those who labor under it we can often extenuate or relieve their sufferings by our advice or by our timely succor we can always give them that consolation which results from the sense of our sympathizing with their pains by accustoming ourselves thus to give them ease we shall advance in that brotherly love which of is so great importance in the christian temper that our savior has made it the distinctive characteristic of his genuine disciples  consideration of the distresses which are common in human life and which many around us labor under is no less fit for exciting and improving pious affections to that god who makes sore and binds up who wounds and his hands make whole job v     it is prosperity indeed that contains the strongest reasons for piety the enjoyments of life render our love and thankfulness most justly due to him who gives us richly all things to enjoy   timothy vi     they demand our fullest satisfaction in the appointments of his providence and our most cheerful obedience to the dictates of his will but experience testifies that we are aptest to be undutiful when we are most indbted when we are full we deny god and say who is the lord prove xxx    they who are not in trouble as other men whose eyes stand out with fatness who have more than heart could wish speak lostily they set their mouth against the heavens pride compasses them about as a chain psalm lxxiii          their houses are safe from fear neither is the rod of god upon them they take the timbrel and harp and rejoice at the sound of the organ they spend their days in wealth therefore they say unto god depart from us for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways what is the almighty that we should serve him job xxi             when prosperity is so intoxicating if we enjoy it unimpaired can we escape its baneful influence without setting ourselves to ponder the adversities under which others groan if we saw nothing around us but the glitter of prosperity we could scarcely fail to lose all sense of god it is when they fix their eyes on the calamities of which the world is so full which many of their neighbors feel and to which they also are obnoxious that the prosperous are awakened to sobriety of mind recalled to themselves and to the acknowledgement of a god in whose hand is the breath of all mankind chap xii  0  who takes away and none can hinder him nor say unto him what do thou chap ix     it is this view of things that from an instrument of corrupting their hearts converts their ease and affluence into an efficacious means of elevating and enlarging them to run the way of gods commandments ps cxix     and to delight themselves in him it is this view of things that rouses them to a sense of the sovereign authority of his laws and of the infinite importance of his love and impels them to seek his favor above all things by keeping his precepts with their whole hearts it is this view of things that leads those whose mountain stands strongest psalm xxx    to perceive the necessity of resignation to the governor of the world of submission to his uncontrollable dominion of trust and confidence in the unsearchable wisdom of his providence religion is the only asylum of the afflicted and therefore familiarity with affliction cannot fail to instigate every man of prudence to secure its protection in the day of trouble by having recourse to it while the candle of the lord yet shines upon him you would think your situation dismal if you found yourselves your families and your friends in a dreary wilderness without a morsel of bread without a drop of water without a guide without defense or refuge from the wild beasts that howled on every side you would be inconsolable if you should awake with all who are dearest to you in a leaky vessel without a pilot in a tempestuous unknown boundless ocean the sport of wind and waves in the moment of safety you would tremble in the consciousness that there is not security for another moment to the man who is a stranger to religion who lives without god who has no regard to him nor interest in him this world is a drearier wilderness and a more tempestuous ocean amidst numberless calamities which he sees every moment raging all around him and which he has neither power nor prudence to avert from himself he has no director no guardian no hope no consolation that man alone is blessed who can say unto god nevertheless i am continually with thee thou have holden me by my right hand thou shall guide me with thy counsel and afterward receive me to glory psalm lxxxiii         consideration of adversity tends also to form our hearts to resolution fortitude and patience prosperity enervates the soul continued gaiety and dissipation render it too delicate to bear the slightest shock experience of adversity most effectually produces hardiness and strength of mind periods of commotion and distress seldom fail to abound with heroic spirits to be often conversant with the objects of distress will contribute to it not a little it will prepare us for bearing our own troubles and it will show us the necessity of strengthening ourselves to bear them to befall us unexpectedly doubles the severity of every affliction by being seriously contemplated beforehand it is rendered familiar to us its aspect becomes less formidable we have time to excite our courage and to collect all the vigor of our souls for encountering it if we frequently turn our eyes to the dark side of human life we cannot avoid discerning that the lot of every man is inevitably checquered with sorrow by the irreversible sentence of god the whole creation is subjected to vanity romans viii  0  to every thing there is a season and a time to every purpose under heaven a time to be born and a time to die a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance eccl iii        it is in vain to expect exemption from calamity all that we can do is to reconcile ourselves to it as much as possible to prepare ourselves for bearing it whenever it shall come and on the foundation of pious resignation to build up fortitude that we may not repine at the chastening of the lord nor faint when we are rebuked of him heb xii    that it would be inexcuseable to faint attention to the calamities of others is sufficient to convince us we may see some subjected to heavier calamities than we endure or have reason to apprehend  so different so contrary are the tendencies of the house of feasting and the house of mourning the former dissolves the soul in levity dispels all profitable thoughts and gives no scope to the exercise of any good affection the latter composes the mind into seriousness and recollection suggests the most important and instructive truths and draws out and improves the noblest virtues our duty therefore is clear with respect to both  since the gaieties and the enjoyments of life tend rather to corrupt than to improve the heart we ought to be very moderate in the indulgence of them if at any time it appear difficult to fix the precise point where moderation ends it is much safer to abstain unnecessarily than to incur a possibility of exceeding to make mirth and jollity and pleasure and amusement the business of our lives for the sake of them to neglect the call of any duty to bestow on them the hour which we have an inviting opportunity of employing to worthier purposes is indisputably to exceed the most innocent of the kind should be indulged but rarely and for a short time as necessary relaxations despicable is the life that is wasted in thoughtless dissipation and festivity it is remarked to the dishonor of the rich man mentioned in the gospel that he ared sumptuously every day luke xvi    she that lives in pleasure is dead while she lives  tim v    life is given us for infinitely more important purposes to be intoxicated with the love of pleasure to be unhappy in the want of gay entertainments by the use of them to contract a disrelish for the business of life and the occupations of religion to run into such of them as are in the least degree unlawful in their nature is alike below the dignity and contrary to the duty of creatures who are reasonable and immortal but from those who are constantly at ease it will require the most careful circumspection always to avoid it it will require such a jealous vigilance over themselves as job exercised over his sons when the days of their feasting were gone about he sent and sanctified them and offered burntofferings according to the number of them all for job said it may be that my sons have sinned and cursed god in the hearts ob i    in seasons of the highest festivity let us beware of abandoning ourselves to levity let a sense of god mixing with our relaxations preserve them moderate and innocent  let our enjoyment of our own prosperity be accompanied by a tender sensibility to the sufferings of others we are not required to dwell in the house of mourning but in many ways we are called upon to pay it frequent visits for this very end compassion is made one of the strongest movements of the human heart in compassionating distress we taste a solemn serious pleasure deeper and more lasting than all the joys of mirth we are conscious of a more satisfying complacence in the tear of sympathy than in the loudest roar of laughter we enjoy the delightful reflection that we do some good to those who stand most in need of it to be unpitied in distress to be neglected by neighbors to be forsaken by former friends strikes a dagger into the wounded heart it was with anguish of soul that job exclaimed my brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook and as the stream of brooks they pass away which are blackish by reason of the ice and wherein the snow is hid what time they wax warm they vanish when it is hot they are consumed out of their place job vi           when he is parched with the sultry heat of trouble they refuse him a drop of comfort will we decline a fellowfeeling with calamity when we know that ourselves are also in the body heb xiii   and subject to the like calamities the being involved in a common danger is generally a bond of the strictest union if credit be due to history the fiercest animals have sometimes laid aside their fierceness and abstained from their prey when along with it they were surprised into a situation of imminent distress shall a sudden panic tame the savage brute and shall reflection be unable to inspire man with humanity to man we are all brethren exposed to the same perils the same soothing pity the same kind attention which this hour would pour balm into our neighbors wounds we ourselves may need the next let not the fullness of our own present precarious enjoyment harden our hearts against the cry of poverty or the groan of sickness when we have light in our own dwellings let us endeavor to dispel the darkness in which others sit the greater the peace and ease which prevails at home the more we are at leisure to regard the disquiets which walk around us the more abundantly we have received the more abundantly we ought to impart but as improving as the house of mourning is it is possible to visit it without advantage by enuring us to the sight of pain it may only wear off our sensibility by tempting us to mix our murmurings with the complaints of the afflicted it may corrupt us into discontent it may teach us to repine against gods appointment of so imperfect happiness to the inhabitants of earth it has its own snares against which as well as the contrary snares we must be upon our guard we must take pains to learn its lessons we must labor to acquire sobriety of mind we must encourage serious reflections and inculcate them upon ourselves we must exercise ourselves in diligent application to the practice of virtue and we must pray to god for his assistance in forming us to a right sense of the world and in directing us to pursue it so as to prepare us for a better world  now unto him that is able to make all things to work together for your good be glory and honor for
