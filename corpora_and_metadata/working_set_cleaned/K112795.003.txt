the art of poetry an epistle to the pisos translated from horace  with notes  revised and corrected  first printed in the year mdcclxxxiii  to the rev joseph warton d d master of winchester school and to the rev thomas warton bd fellow of trinity college oxford my dear friends in a conversation some months ago i happened to mention to you the idea i had long entertained of that celebrated epistle of horace commonly distinguished by the title of the art of poetry i will not say that you acceded to my opinion but i flatter myself that i in some degree interested your curiosity and engaged your attention our discourse at least revived an intention i had once formed of communicating my thoughts on the subject to the public an intention i had only dropped for want of leisure and inclination to attempt a translation of the epistle which i thought necessary to accompany the original and my remarks on it in the original horace assumes the air and style of an affectionate teacher admonishing and instructing his young friends and pupils but the following translation together with the observations annexed i address to you as my masters from whom i look for sound information a wellgrounded confirmation of my hypothesis or a solution of my doubts and a correction of my errors  it is almost needless to observe that the epistle in question has very particularly exercised the critical sagacity of the literary world yet it is remarkable that amidst the great variety of comments and decisions on the work it has been almost universally considered except by one acute and learned writer of this country as a loose vague and desultory composition a mass of shining materials like pearls unstrung valuable indeed but not displayed to advantage  some have contended with scaliger at their head that this pretended art of poetry is totally void of art and that the very work in which the beauty and excellence of order ordinis virtus et venus is strongly recommended is in itself unconnected confused and immethodical the advocates for the writer have in great measure confessed the charge but pleaded in excuse and vindication the familiarity of an epistle and even the genius of poetry in which the formal divisions of a prosaick treatise on the art would have been insupportable they have also denied that horace ever intended such a treatise or that he ever gave to this epistle the title of the art of poetry on which title the attacks of scaliger and his followers are chiefly grounded the title however is confessedly as old as the age of quintilian and that the work itself has a perpetual reference to poets and poetry is as evident as that it is from beginning to end in its manner style address and form perfectly epistolary  the learned and ingenious critic distinguished above an early ornament to letters and now a worthy dignitary of the church leaving vain comments and idle disputes on the title of the work sagaciously directed his researches to scrutinize the work itself properly endeavoring to trace and investigate from the composition the end and design of the writer and remembering the axiom of the poet to whom his friend had been appointed the commentator  in every work regard the authors end for none can compass more than they intend  pope with this view of illustrating and explaining horaces art of poetry this shrewd and able writer about thirty years ago republished the original epistle giving the text chiefly after dr bentley subjoining an english commentary and notes and prefixing an introduction from which i beg leave to transcribe most part of the three first paragraphs  it is agreed on all hands that the ancients are our masters in the art of composition such of their writings therefore as deliver instructions for the exercise of this art must be of the highest value and if any of them has acquired a credit in this respect superior to the rest it is perhaps the following work which the learned have long since considered as a kind of summary of the rules of good writing to be gotten by heart by every young student and to whose decisive authority the greatest masters in taste and composition must finally submit  but the more unquestioned the credit of this poem is the more it will concern the public that it be justly and accurately understood the writer of these sheets then believed it might be of use if he took some pains to clear the sense connect the method and ascertain the scope and purpose of this admired epistle others he knew indeed and some of the first fame for critical learning had been before him in his attempt yet he did not find himself prevented by their labors in which besides innumerable lesser faults he more especially observed two inveterate errors of such a sort as must needs perplex the genius and distress the learning of any commentator the one of these respects the subject the other the method of the art of poetry it will be necessary to say something upon each    that the art of poetry at large is not the proper subject of this piece is so apparent that it has not escaped the dullest and least attentive of its critics for however all the different kinds of poetry might appear to enter into it yet every one saw that some at least were very slightly considered whence the frequent attempts the arts et institutiones poeticae of writers both at home and abroad to supply its deficiencies but though this truth was seen and confessed it unluckily happened that the sagacity of his numerous commentators went no further they still considered this famous epistle as a collection though not a system of criticisms on poetry in general with this concession however that the stage had evidently the largest share in it satyra haec est in sui saeculi poetas praecipue vero in romanum drama baxter  under the influence of this prejudice several writers of name took upon them to comment and explain it and with the success which was to be expected from so fatal a mistake on setting out as the not seeing that the proper and sole purpose of the author was not to abridge the greek critics whom he probably never thought of nor to amuse himself with composing a short critical system for the general use of poets which every line of it absolutely confutes but simply to criticize the roman drama for to this end not the tenor of the work only but as will appear every single precept in it ultimately refers the mischiefs of this original error have been long felt it has occasioned a constant perplexity in defining the general method and in fixing the import of particular rules nay its effects have reached still further for conceiving as they did that the whole had been composed out of the greek critics the labor and ingenuity of its interpreters have been misemployed in picking out authorities which were not wanted and in producing or more properly by their studied refinements in creating conformities which were never designed whence it has come to pass that instead of investigating the order of the poets own reflections and scrutinizing the peculiar state of the roman stage the methods which common sense and common criticism would prescribe the world has been nauseated with insipid lectures on aristotle and phalereus whose solid sense has been so attenuated and subtilized by the delicate operation of french criticism as has even gone some way toward bringing the art itself into disrepute    but the wrong explications of this poem have arisen not from the misconception of the subject only but from an inattention to the method of it the latter was in part the genuine consequence of the former for not suspecting an unity of design in the subject its interpreters never looked for or could never find a consistency of disposition in the method and this was indeed the very block upon which heinsius and before him julius scaliger himself stumbled these illustrious critics with all the force of genius which is required to disembarrass an involved subject and all the aids of learning that can lend a ray to enlighten a dark one have notwithstanding found themselves utterly unable to unfold the order of this epistle insomuch that scaliger praef in lib poet et l vi p     has boldly pronounced the conduct of it to be vicious and heinsius had no other way to evade the charge than by recurring to the forced and uncritical expedient of a licentious transposition the truth is they were both in one common error that the poets purpose had been to write a criticism of the art of poetry at large and not as is here shown of the roman drama in particular  the remainder of this introduction as well as the commentary and notes afford ample proofs of the erudition and ingenuity of the critic yet i much doubt whether he has been able to convince the learned world of the truth of his main proposition that it was the proper and sole purpose of the author simply to criticize the roman drama his commentary is it must be owned extremely seducing yet the attentive reader of horace will perhaps often fancy that he perceives a violence and constraint offered to the composition in order to accommodate it to the system of the commentator who to such a reader may perhaps seem to mark transitions and point out connections as well as to maintain a method in the commentary which cannot clearly be deduced from the text to which it refers  this very ingenious commentary opens as follows  the subject of this piece being as i suppose one viz the state of the roman drama and common sense requiring even in the freest forms of composition some kind of method the intelligent reader will not be surprised to find the poet prosecuting his subject in a regular wellordered plan which for the more exact description of it i distinguish into three parts  i the first of them from l   to    is preparatory to the main subject of the epistle containing some general rules and reflections on poetry but principally with an eye to the following parts by which means it serves as an useful introduction to the poets design and opens with that air of ease and elegance essential to the epistolary form  ii the main body of the epistle from l    to     is laid out in regulating the roman stage but chiefly in giving rules for tragedy not only as that was the sublimer species of the drama but as it should seem less cultivated and understood  iii the last part from l     to the end exhorts to correctness in writing yet still with an eye principally to the dramatick species and is taken up partly in removing the causes that prevented it and partly in directing to the use of such means as might serve to promote it such is the general plan of the epistle  in this general summary with which the critic introduces his particular commentary a very material circumstance is acknowledged which perhaps tends to render the system on which it proceeds extremely doubtful if not wholly untenable the original epistle consists of four hundred and seventysix lines and it appears from the above numerical analysis that not half of those lines only two hundred and six verses from v    to     are employed on the subject of the roman stage the first of the three parts above delineated from v   to    certainly contains general rules and restrictions on poetry but surely with no particular reference to the drama as to the second part the critic i think might fairly have extended the poets consideration of the drama to the    th line seventy lines further than he has carried it but the last hundred and eleven lines of the epistle so little allude to the drama that the only passage in which a mention of the stage has been supposed to be implied  ludusque repertus etc is by the learned and ingenious critic himself particularly distinguished with a very different interpretation nor can this portion of the epistle be considered by the impartial and intelligent reader as a mere exhortation to correctness in writing taken up partly in removing the causes that prevented it and partly in directing to the use of such means as might serve to promote it correctness is indeed here as in many other parts of horaces satires and epistles occasionally inculcated but surely the main scope of this animated conclusion is to deter those who are not blessed with genius from attempting the walks of poetry  i much approve what this writer has urged on the unity of subject and beauty of epistolary method observed in this work but cannot agree that the main subject and intention was the regulation of the roman stage how far i may differ concerning particular passages will appear from the notes at the end of this translation in controversial criticism difference of opinion cannot but be expressed veniam petimusque damusque vicissim but i hope i shall not be thought to have delivered my sentiments with petulance or be accused of want of respect for a character that i most sincerely reverence and admire  i now proceed to set down in writing the substance of what i suggested to you in conversation concerning my own conceptions of the end and design of horace in this epistle in this explanation i shall call upon horace as my chief witness and the epistle itself as my principal voucher should their testimonies prove adverse my system must be abandoned like many that have preceded it as vain and chimerical and if it should even by their support be acknowledged and received it will i think like the egg of columbus appear so plain easy and obvious that it will seem almost wonderful that the epistle has never been considered in the same light till now i do not wish to dazzle with the luster of a new hypothesis which requires i think neither the strong optics nor powerful glasses of a critical herschel to ascertain the truth of it but is a system that lies level to common apprehension and a luminary discoverable by the naked eye  my notion is simply this i conceive that one of the sons of piso undoubtedly the elder had either written or meditated a poetical work most probably a tragedy and that he had with the knowledge of the family communicated his piece or intention to horace but horace either disapproving of the work or doubting of the poetical faculties of the elder piso or both wished to dissuade him from all thoughts of publication with this view he formed the design of writing this epistle addressing it with a courtliness and delicacy perfectly agreeable to his acknowledged character indifferently to the whole family the father and his two sons epistola ad pisones de art poetica  he begins with general reflections generally addressed to his three friends credit pisones  pater and juvenes patre digni  in these preliminary rules equally necessary to be observed by poets of every denomination he dwells on the necessity of unity of design the danger of being dazzled by the splendour of partial beauties the choice of subjects the beauty of order the elegance and propriety of diction and the use of a thorough knowledge of the nature of the several different species of poetry summing up this introductory portion of his epistle in a manner perfectly agreeable to the conclusion of it  descriptas servare vices operumque colores cur ego si nequeo ignoroque poeta salutor cur nescire pudens prave quam discere malo from this general view of poetry on the canvas of aristotle but entirely after his own manner the writer proceeds to give the rules and history of the drama adverting principally to tragedy with all its constituents and appendages of diction fable character incidents chorus measure music and decoration in this part of the work according to the interpretation of the best critics and indeed i think according to the manifest tenor of the epistle he addresses himself entirely to the two young gentlemen pointing out to them the difficulty as well as excellence of the dramatick art insisting on the avowed superiority of the grecian writers and ascribing the comparative failure of the romans to negligence and avarice the poet having exhausted this part of his subject suddenly drops a second dismissing at once no less than two of the three persons to whom he originally addressed his epistle and turning short on the elder piso most earnestly conjures him to ponder on the danger of precipitate publications and the ridicule to which the author of wretched poetry exposes himself from the commencement of this partial address o major juvenum etc v     to the end of the poem almost a fourth part of the whole the second person plural pisones  vos  vos o pompilius sanguis etc is discarded and the second person singular tu te tibi etc invariably takes its place the arguments too are equally relative and personal not only showing the necessity of study combined with natural genius to constitute a poet but dwelling on the peculiar danger and delusion of flattery to a writer of rank and fortune as well as the inestimable value of an honest friend to rescue him from derision and contempt the poet however in reverence to the muse qualifies his exaggerated description of an infatuated scribbler with a most noble encomium on the uses of good poetry vindicating the dignity of the art and proudly asserting that the most exalted characters would not be disgraced by the cultivation of it  ne forte pudori sit tibi musa lyrae solers and cantor apollo it is worthy observation that in the satirical picture of a frantic bard with which horace concludes his epistle he not only runs counter to what might be expected as a corollary of an essay on the art of poetry but contradicts his own usual practice and sentiments in his epistle to augustus instead of stigmatizing the love of verse as an abominable phrensy he calls it levis haec insania a slight madness and descants on its good effects  quantas virtutes habeat sic collige  in another epistle speaking of himself and his addiction to poetry he says  ubi quid datur oti illudo chartis hoc est mediocribus illis ex vitiis unum etc   all which and several other passages in his works almost demonstrate that it was not without a particular purpose in view that he dwelt so forcibly on the description of a man resolved  in spite of nature and his stars to write   to conclude if i have not contemplated my system till i am become blind to its imperfections this view of the epistle not only preserves to it all that unity of subject and elegance of method so much insisted on by the excellent critic to whom i have so often referred but by adding to his judicious general abstract the familiarities of personal address so strongly marked by the writer scarce a line appears idle or misplaced while the order and disposition of the epistle to the pisos appears as evident and unembarrassed as that of the epistle to augustus in which last the actual state of the roman drama seems to have been more manifestly the object of horaces attention than in the work now under consideration  before i leave you to the further examination of the original of horace and submit to you the translation with the notes that accompany it i cannot help observing that the system which i have here laid down is not so entirely new as it may perhaps at first appear to the reader or as i myself originally supposed it no critic indeed has to my knowledge directly considered the whole epistle in the same light that i have now taken it but yet particular passages seem so strongly to enforce such an interpretation that the editors translators and commentators have been occasionally driven to explanations of a similar tendency of which the notes annexed will exhibit several striking instances  of the following version i shall only say that i have not knowingly adopted a single expression tending to warp the judgment of the learned or unlearned reader in favor of my own hypothesis i attempted this translation chiefly because i could find no other equally close and literal even the version of roscommon though in blank verse is in some parts a paraphrase and in others but an abstract i have myself indeed endeavored to support my right to that force and freedom of translation which horace himself recommends yet i have faithfully exhibited in our language several passages which his professed translators have abandoned as impossible to be given in english  all i think necessary to be further said on the epistle will appear in the notes  i am my dear friends with the truest respect and regard your most sincere admirer and very affectionate humble servant george colman london march        q horatii flacci epistola ad pisones humano capiti cervicem pictor equinam jungere si velit et varias inducere

doves to tigers lambkins join often works of promise large and high attempt are piecd and guarded to escape contempt with here and there a remnant highly dressed that glitters through the gloom of all the rest then dians grove and altar are the theme then through rich meadows winds the silver stream the river rhine perhaps adorns the lines or the gay rainbow in description shines these we allow have each their several grace but each and several now are out of place a cypress you can draw what then youre hired and from your art a seapiece is required a shipwrecked mariner despairing faint the price paid down you are ordained to paint on with your art proceed as you begun why dwindle to a cruet from a tun simple be all you execute and one loved sire loved sons well worthy such a sire most bards are dupes to beauties they admire proud to be brief for brevity must please i grow obscure the follower of ease wants nerve and soul the lover of sublime swells to bombast while he who dreads that crime too fearful of the whirlwind rising round a wretched reptile creeps along the ground the bard ambitious fancies who displays and tortures one poor thought a thousand ways heaps prodigies on prodigies in woods pictures the dolphin and the boar in stoods thus even the fear of faults to faults betrays unless a masterhand conduct the lays an under workman of the aemilian class shall mould the nails and trace the hair in brass bungling at last because his narrow soul wants room to comprehend a perfect whole to be this man would i a work compose no more i would wish than for a horrid nose with hair as black as jet and eyes as black as sloes select all ye who write a subject fit a subject not too mighty for your wit and ere you lay your shoulders to the wheel weigh well their

and we our sires and sons without a crime may stamp on words the coinage of the time as branching woods let fall and change their leaves our language too a change of words receives year after year drop off the ancient race while young ones bud and flourish in their place nor we nor all we do can death withstand whether the sea imprisoned in the land a work imperial takes a harbours form where navies ride secure and mock the storm whether the marsh within whose horrid shore barrenness dwelt and boatmen plied the oar now furrowed by the plough a laughing plain feeds all the cities round with fertile grain or if the river by a prudent force the corn once flooding learns a better course the works of mortal man shall all decay and words are graced and honored but a day many shall wake revived that now lie dead many shall fade and all their glories shed custom alone their rank and date can teach custom the sovereign law and rule of speech for deeds of kings and chiefs and battles fought what numbers are most fitting homer taught couplets unequal were at first confined to speak in broken verse the mourners mind prosperity at length and free content in the same numbers gave their raptures vent but who first framed the elegys small song grammarians squabble and will squabble long archilochus resentments bitter rage armed with his own iambicks to engage with these the humble sock and buskin proud shaped dialogue and stilled the noisy crowd embraced the measure proved its ease and force and found it apt for business or discourse gods and the sons of gods in odes to

power and art no skill if marking nicer shades i miss my aim why am i greet with a poets name or if through ignorance i cannot discern why from false modesty forbear to learn a comic incident loathes tragic strains thy feast thyestes lowly verse disdains familiar diction scorns as base and mean touching too nearly on the comic scene each style allotted to its proper place let each appear with its peculiar grace yet comedy at times exalts her strain and angry chremes storms in swelling vein the tragic hero plunged in deep distress sinks with his fate and makes his language less peleus and telephus poor banished each drops his foothalffoot words and sounding speech or else what bosom in his grief takes part which cracks the ear but cannot touch the heart it is not enough that plays are polished chaste or trickt in all the harlotry of taste they must have ppassion too beyond control transporting where they please the hearers soul with those that smile our face in smiles appears with those that weep our cheeks are bathed in tears to make me grieve be first your anguish shown and i shall feel your sorrows like my own peleus and telephus unless your style suit with your circumstance i will sleep or smile features of sorrow mournful words require anger in menace speaks and words of fire the playful prattle in a frolic vein and the severe affect a serious strain for nature first to every varying wind of changeful fortune shapes the pliant mind sooths it with pleasure or to rage provokes or brings it to the ground by sorrows heavy strokes then of the joys that charmed or woes that wrung forces expression from the faithful tongue but if the actors words belie his state and speak a language foreign to his fate romans shall crack their sides and all the town join horse and foot to laugh the impostor down just dialogue to every speaker fit their several rank and character should hit hero or god the sire sedate and grave or the warm youth to passion still a slave matron or nurse the merchant used to roam or farmer ploughing his rich field at home if colchian or assyrian fill the scene theban or argian note the shades between follow the voice of fame or if you feign the fabled plan consistently sustain if homers hero you bring back to view show your achilles such as homer drew active warm brave impetuous high of soul calling to arms and brooking no control fierce let medea seem in horrors clad perfidious be ixion ino sad io a wanderer and orestes mad should you adventring novelty engage some bold original to tread the stage true to the parent mould in which twas cast sustain the character from first to last yet hard the task to touch on untried facts safer the iliad to reduce to acts than be the first new regions to explore and dwell on themes unknown untold before quit but the vulgar broad and beaten round the public field becomes your private ground nor word for word too faithfully translate nor leap at once into a narrow strait a copyist so close that rule and line curb your free march and all your steps confine be not your opening fierce in accents bold like the rude balladmongers chaunt of old  the fall of priam the great trojan king  of the right noble trojan war i sing where ends this boaster who with voice of thunder wakes expectation all agape with wonder the mountains labor hushed are all the spheres and oh ridiculous a mouse

words can freely sound and with a steadier footstep prints the ground places in playfellows his chief delight quarrels shakes hands and cares not wrong or right swayed by each favorite baubles shortlived power in smiles in tears all humors every hour the beardless youth at length from tutor free loves horses hounds the field and liberty pliant as wax to vice his easy soul marble to wholesome counsel and control improvident of good of wealth profuse high fond yet fickle generous yet loose to graver studies new pursuits inclined manhood with growing years brings change of mind seeks riches friends with thirst of honor glows and all the meanness of ambition knows prudent and wary on each deed intent fearful to act and afterward repent evil in various shapes old age surrounds riches his aim in riches he abounds yet what he gained in fear he fears to lose and what he sought as useful dares not use timid and cold in all he undertakes his hand from doubt as well as weakness shakes hope makes him tedious fond of dull delay dupd by tomorrow though he dies today illhumourd querulous yet loud in praise of all the mighty deeds of former days when he was young good heavens what glorious times unlike the present age that teems with crimes thus years advancing many comforts bring and flying bear off many on their wing confound not youth with age nor age with youth but mark their several characters with truth events are on the stage in act displayed or by narration if unseen conveyed cold is the tale distilling through the ear filling the soul with less dismay and fear than where spectators view like standersby the deed submitted to the faithful eye yet force not on the stage to wound the sight acts that should pass within and shun the light many there are the eye should never behold but touching eloquence in time unfold who on medeas parricide can look view horrid atreus human garbage cook if a birds feathers i see progne take if i see cadmus slide into a

unworthily betrayed unless some great occasion ask his aid let no fourth person laboring for a speech make in the dialogue a needless breach an actors part the chorus should sustain gentle in all its office and humane chaunting no odes between the acts that seem unapt or foreign to the general theme let it to virtue prove a guide and friend curb tyrants and the humble good defend loud let it praise the joys that temperance waits of justice sing the real health of states the laws and peace secure with open gates faithful and secret let it heaven invoke to turn from the unhappy fortunes stroke and all its vengeance on the proud provoke the pipe of old as yet with brass unbound nor rivalling as now the trumpets sound but slender simple and its stops but few breathed to the chorus and was useful too no crowded seats wedged close and closer still then asking powerful blasts their space to fill when the thin audience pious frugal chaste with modest mirth indulged their sober taste but soon as the proud victor spurns all bounds and growing rome a wider wall surrounds when noontide revels and the daylight bowl license on holidays a flow of soul a richer stream of melody is known numbers more copious and a fuller tone  for what alas could the unpracticed ear of rusticks revelling over country cheer a motley groupe high low and froth and scum distinguish but shrill squeak and dronish hum  the piper grown luxuriant in his art with dance and flowing vest embellishes his part now too its powers increased the lyre severe with richer numbers smites the listening ear sudden bursts forth a flood of rapid song rolling a tide of eloquence along useful prophetic wise the strain divine breathes all the spirit of the delphick shrine he who the prize a filthy goat to gain at first contended in the tragic strain soon too  though rude the graver mood unbroke  stripped the rough satyrs and essayed a joke for holidayspectators flushed and wild with new conceits and mummeries were beguiled yet should the satyrs so chastise their mirth tempring the jest that gives their sallies birth changing from grave to gay so keep the mean that god or hero of the lofty scene in royal gold and purple seen but late may never in cots obscure debase his state lost in low language nor in too much care to shun the ground grasp clouds and empty air with an indignant pride and coy disdain stern tragedy rejects too light a vein like a grave matron destined to advance on solemn festivals to join the dance mixed with the shaggy tribe of satyrs rude she will hold a sober mien and act the prude never would i pisos in the sylvan scene use abject terms alone and phrases mean nor of high tragic coloring afraid neglect too much the difference of shade davus may jest pert pythias may beguile simo of cash in a familiar style the same low strain silenus would disgrace servant and guardian of the godlike race let me on subjects known my verse so frame so follow it that each may hope the same daring the same and toiling to prevail may vainly toil and only dare to fail such virtues order and connection bring from common arguments such honors spring the woodland fauns their origin should heed take no town stamp nor seem the city breed nor let them aping young gallants repeat verses that run upon too tender feet nor fall into a low indecent style breaking dull jests to make the vulgar smile for higher ranks such ribaldry despise condemn the poet and withhold the prize to a short syllable a long subjoined forms an iambick foot so light a kind that when six pure iambicks rolled along so nimbly moved so trippingly the song the feet to half their number lost their claim and trimeter iambicks was their name hence that the measure might more grave appear and with a slower march approach the ear from the fourth foot and second not displaced the steady spondee kindly it embraced then in firm union socially unites admitting the ally to equal rights accius and ennius lines thus duly wrought in their bold trimeters but rarely sought yet scenes oerloaded with a verse of lead a mass of heavy numbers on their head speak careless haste neglect in every part or shameful ignorance of the poets art  not every critic spies a faulty strain and pardon roman poets should disdain shall i then all regard all labor slight break loose at once and all at random write or shall i fear that all my faults descry viewing my errors with an eagle eye and thence correctness make my only aim pleased to be safe and sure of scaping blame thus i from faults indeed may guard my lays but neither they nor i can merit praise pisos be grecian models your delight night and day read them read them day and night  well but our fathers plautus loved to praise  admired his humor and approved his lays yes they saw both with a too partial eye fond even to folly sure if you and i know ribaldry from humor chaste and terse or can but scan and have an ear for verse a kind of tragic ode unknown before thespis it is said invented first and bore cartloads of verse about and with him went a troop begrimd to sing and represent next aeschylus a mask to shroud the face a robe devised to give the peson grace on humble rafters raised a stage and taught the buskined actor with his spirit fraught to breathe with dignity the lofty thought to these succeeded with no little praise the good old comedy of ancient days till liberty grown rank and run to seed called for tho hand of law to pluck the weed the statute past the slandrous chorus drowned in shameful silence lost the power to wound nothing have roman poets left untried nor added little to their countrys pride daring their grecian masters to forsake and for their themes domestic glories take whether the gown prescribed an air more mean or the inwoven purple raised the scene nor would the splendor of the latian name from arms than letters boast a brighter fame had they not scorning the laborious file grudged time to mellow and refine their style but you bright hopes of the pompilian blood never the verse approve and hold as good till many a day and many a blot has wrought the polished work and chastend every thought by tenfold labor to perfection brought because democritus thinks wretched art too mean with genius to sustain a part to helicon allowing no pretense till the mad bard has lost all common sense many there are their nails who will not pare or trim their beards or bathe or take the air for he no doubt must be a bard renowned that head with deathless laurel must be crowned though past the power of hellebore insane which no vile cutberds razord hands profane ah luckless i each spring that purge the bile or whod write better but it is scarce worth while so as mere hone my services i pledge edgeless itself it gives the steel an edge no writer i to those that write impart the nature and the duty of their art whence springs the fund what forms the bard to know what nourishes his powers and makes them grow what is fit or unfit whither genius tends and where fond ignorance and dullness ends in wisdom moral wisdom to excel is the chief cause and spring of writing well draw elements from the socratick source and full of matter words will rise of course he who has learnt a patriots glorious flame what friendship asks what filial duties claim the ties of blood and secret links that bind the heart to strangers and to all mankind the senators the judges peaceful care and sterner duties of the chief in war these who has studied well will all engage in functions suited to their rank and age on natures pattern too i will bid him look and copy manners from her living book sometimes twill chance a poor and barren tale where neither excellence nor art prevail with now and then a passage of some merit and characters sustained and drawn with spirit pleases the people more and more obtains than tuneful nothings mere poetic strains the sons of greece the favoring muse inspired inflamed their souls and with true genius fired taught by the muse they sung the loftiest lays and knew no avarice but that of praise the lads of rome to study fractions bound into an hundred parts can split a pound  say albins hopeful from five twelfths an ounce  and what remains  a third  well said young pounce  youre a made man  but add an ounce  what then a half indeed surprising good again from minds debased with such a sordid lust cankered and eaten up with this vile rust can we a verse that gives the genius scope worthy the cedar and the cypress hope instruction to convey or give delight or both at once to compass poets write short be your precepts and the impression strong that minds may catch them quick and hold them long the bosom full and satisfied the taste all that runs over will but run to waste fictions to please like truths must meet the eye nor must the fable tax our faith too high shall lamia in our sight her sons devour and give them back alive the selfsame hour the old if morals wanting damn the play and sentiment disgusts the young and gay he who instruction and delight can blend please with his fancy with his moral mend hits the nice point and every vote obtains his work a fortune to the sosii gains flies over seas and on the wings of fame carries from age to age the writers deathless name yet there are faults that we may pardon too for ah the string will not always answer true but spite of hand and mind the treacherous harp will sound a flat when we intend a sharp the bow not always constant and the same will sometimes carry wide and lose its aim but in the verse where many beauties shine i blame not here and there a feeble line nor take offense at every idle trip where haste prevails or nature makes a slip what is the result then why thus stands the case as the transcriber in the selfsame place who still mistakes though warned of his neglect no pardon for his blunders can expect or as the minstrel his disgrace must bring who harps for ever on the same false string from faults scarce ever free the poet thus appears to me a very chaeribus who twice or thrice by some adventure rare stumbling on beauties makes me smile and stare me who am grieved and vexed to the extreme if homer seem to nod or chance to dream though in a work of length oerlabourd sleep at intervals may not unpardoned creep poems and pictures are adjudgd alike some charm us near and some at distance strike this loves the shade this challenges the light daring the keenest criticks eagle sight this once has pleased this ever will delight o thou my pisos elder hope and pride though well a fathers voice thy steps can guide though inbred sense what is wise and right can tell remember this from me and weigh it well in certain things things neither high nor proud middling and passable may be allowed a moderate proficient in the laws a moderate defender of a cause boasts not messalas pleadings nor is deemed aulus in jurisprudence yet esteemed but middling poets or degrees in wit nor men nor gods nor rubrickposts admit at festivals as music out of tune ointment or honey rank disgust us soon because they are not essential to the guest and might be spared unless the very best thus poetry so exquisite of kind of pleasure born to charm the soul designed if it fall short but little of the first is counted last and ranked among the worst the man unapt for sports of fields and plains from implements of exercise abstains for ball or quoit or hoop without the skill dreading the crouds derision he sits still for poetry he boasts no spark of fire and yet to poetry he dares aspire and why not he is a gentleman with clear good forty thousand sesterces a year a freeman too and all the world allows  as honest as the skin between his brows nothing in spite of genius you will commence such is your judgment such your solid sense but if hereafter you should write the verse to metius to your sire to me rehearse let it sink deep in their judicious ears weigh

stamps conviction in your ravished breast and peace and joy attend the glorious guest essay on translated verse the art of poetry an epistle etc q horatii flacci epistola ad pisones the work of horace now under consideration has been so long known and so generally received by the name of the art of poetry that i have on account of that notoriety submitted this translation to the public under that title rather than what i hold to be the true one viz horaces epistle to the pisos the author of the english commentary has adopted the same title though directly repugnant to his own system and i suppose for the very same reason  the title in general a matter of indifference is in the present instance of much consequence on the title julius scaliger founded his invidious and injudicious attack de art quaeres quid sentiam quid equidem quod de art sine art tradita to ehe title all the editors and commentators have particularly adverted commonly preferring the epistolary denomination but in contradiction to that preference almost universally inscribing the epistle the art of poetry the conduct however of jason de nores a native of cyprus a learned and ingenious writer of the   th century is very remarkable in the year      he published at venice this work of horace accompanied with a commentary and notes written in elegant latin inscribing it after quintilian q horatii flacci liber de art poetica i think it right to mention that i have never seen the first edition published at venice with a copy of the second edition printed at paris i was favored by dr warton of winchester  the very next year however he printed at paris a second edition enriching his notes with many observations on dante and petrarch and changing the title after mature consideration to q horatii flacci epistola ad pisones de art poetica his motives for this change he assigns in the following terms  quare adductum me primum sciant ad inscriptionem operis immutandam non levioribus de causis and quod formam epistolae non autem libri in quo praecepta tradantur vel ex ipso principio prae se ferat and quod in vetustis exemplaribus epistolarum libros subsequatur and quod etiam summi et praestantissimi homines ita sentiant and quod minime nobis obstet quintiliani testimonium ut nonnullis videtur nam si librum appellat quintilianus non est cur non possit inter epistolas enumerari cum et illae ab horatio in libros digestae fuerint quod vero de art poetica idem quintilianus adjungat nihil commoveor cum et in epistolis praecepta de aliqua re tradi possint ab eodemque in omnibus pene et in iis ad scaevam and lollium praecipue jam factum videatur in quibus breviter eos instituit qua ratione apud majores facile versarentur since writing and first publishing the above i have seen the first edition of de nores and find the title of the epistle to be the same as in his second so that he here refers to his departure from the usage of others not to any variation from himself  desprez the dauphin editor retains both titles but says inclining to the epistolary attamen artem poeticam vix appellem cum quintiliano et aliis malim vero epistolam nuncupare cum nonnullis eruditis monsieur dacier inscribes it properly enough agreeable to the idea of porphyry q horatii flacci de art poetica liber seu epistola ad pisones patrem et filios  julius scaliger certainly stands convicted of critical malice by his poor cavil at the supposed title and has betrayed his ignorance of the ease and beauty of epistolary method as well as the most gross misapprehension by his ridiculous analysis of the work resolving it into thirtysix parts he seems however to have not ill conceived the genius of the poem in saying that it relished of satire this he has urged in many parts of his poeticks particularly in the dedicatory epistle to his son not omitting however his constant charge of art without art horatius artem cum inscripsit adeo sine ulla docet art ut satyrae propius totum opus illud esse videatur this comes almost home to the opinion of the author of the elegant commentaries on the two epistles of horace to the pisos and to augustus as expressed in the dedicacation to the latter with the recital of that opinion i shall conclude this long note the genius of rome was bold and elevated but criticism of any kind was little cultivated never professed as an art by this people the specimens we have of their ability in this way of which the most elegant beyond all dispute are the two epistles to augustus and the pisos are slight occasional attempts made in the negligence of common sense and adapted to the peculiar exigencies of their own taste and learning and not by any means the regular productions of art professedly bending itself to this work and ambitious to give the last finishing to the critical system  translated from horace in that very entertaining and instructive publication entitled an essay on the learning and genius of pope the critic recommends as the properest poetical measure to render in english the satires and epistles of horace that kind of familiar blank verse used in a version of terence attempted some years since by the author of this translation i am proud of the compliment yet i have varied from the mode prescribed not because roscommon has already given such a version or because i think the satirical hexameters of horace less familiar than the irregular iambicks of terence english blank verse like the iambick of greece and rome is peculiarly adapted to theatrical action and dialogue as well as to the epick and the more elevated didactick poetry but after the models left by dryden and pope and in the face of the living example of johnson who shall venture to reject rhyme in the province of satire and epistle     trust me my pisos credit pisones  monsieur dacier at a very early period feels the influence of the personal address that governs this epistle remarking on this passage he observes that horace anxious to inspire the pisos with a just taste says earnestly trust me my pisos credit pisones an expression that betrays fear and distrust left the young men should fall into the dangerous error of bad poets and injudicious critics who not only thought the want of unity of subject a pardonable effect of genius but even the mark of a rich and luxuriant imagination and although this epistle continues monsieur dacier is addressed indifferently to piso the father and his sons as appears by v    of the original yet it is to the sons in particular that these precepts are directed a consideration which reconciles the difference mentioned by porphyry scribit ad pisones viros nobiles disertosque patrem et filios vel ut alii volunt ad pisones fratres  desprez the dauphin editor observes also in the same strain porro scribit horatius ad patrem et filios pisones praesertim vero ad hos  the family of the pisos to whom horace addresses this epistle were called calpurnii being descended from calpus son of numa pompilius whence he afterward styles them of the pompilian blood pompilius sanguis   0  the volume such librum persimilem liber observes dacier is a term applied to all literary productions of whatever description this remark is undoubtedly just confirms the sentiments of jason de nores and takes off the force of all the arguments founded on quintilians having styled this epistle liber de art poetica  vossius speaking of the censure of scaliger  de art sine art subjoins sed fallitur cum  putat esse ab horatio qui inscripserat epistolam ad pisones argumentum vero ut in epistolarum caeteris ita in hac etiam ab aliis postea appositum fuit      often works of promise large and high attempt incaeptis gravibus plerumque etc buckinghams essay on poetry roscommons essay on translated verse as well as the satires and art poetique of boileau and popes essay on criticism abound with imitations of horace this passage of our author seems to have given birth to the following lines of buckingham  it is not a flash of fancy which sometimes dazzling our minds sets off the slightest rhimes bright as a blaze but in a moment done true wit is everlasting like the sun which though sometimes behind a cloud retired breaks out again and is the more admired the following lines of pope may perhaps appear to bear a nearer resemblance to this passage of horace  some to conceit alone their taste confine and glittering thoughts struck out at every line pleased with a work where nothings just or fit one glaring chaos and wild heap of wit essay on criticism     simple be all you execute and one denique sit quidvis simplex duntaxat and unum supposing for a moment that the elder piso had actually submitted some poetical effort to the judgment of horace it is natural to conclude that the work was in our poets opinion of the character described in the opening of this epistle studded with brilliant thoughts and adorned with flowery passages but void of plan incoherent irregular and on the whole lame and imperfect      of the aemilian class aemilium circa ludum  literally near the aemilian school alluding to the academy of gladiators of aemilius lentulus in whose neighborhood lived many artists and shopkeepers  pope has given a beautiful illustration of this thought  survey the whole nor seek slight faults to find where nature moves and rapture warms the mind in wit as nature what affects our hearts is not the exactness of peculiar parts it is not a lip or eye we beauty call but the joint force and full result of all thus when we view some wellproportiond dome the worlds just wonder and even thine o rome no single parts unequally surprise all comes united to the admiring eyes no monstrous height or breadth or length appear the whole at once is bold and regular essay on criticism     select all ye who write a subject fit sumite materiam etc  this passage is well imitated by roscommon in his essay on translated verse  the first great work a talk performed by few is that yourself may to yourself be true no mask no tricks no favor no reserve dissect your mind examine every nerve each poet with a different talent writes one praises one instructs another bites horace did never aspire to epick bays nor lofty maro stoop to lyrick lays examine how your humor is inclined and which the ruling passion of your mind stooping to lyrick lays though not inapplicable to some of the lighter odes of horace is not descriptive of the general character of the lyrick muse musa dedit fidibus divos etc  pope takes up the same thought in his essay on criticism  be sure yourself and your own reach to know how far your genius taste and learning go launch not beyond your depth but be discreet and mark that point where sense and dullness meet like kings we lose the conquests gained before by vain ambition still to make them more each might his servile province well command would all but stoop to what they understand     a cunning phrase callida junctura  jason de nores and many other interpreters agree that horace here recommends after aristotle the artful elevation of style by the use of common words in an uncommon sense producing at once an air of familiarity and magnificence some however confine the expression callida junctura to signify compound words the author of the english commentary adopts the first construction but considers the precept in both senses and illustrates each by many beautiful examples from the plays of shakespeare these examples he has accompanied with much elegant and judicious observation as the reader of taste will be convinced by the following short extracts  the writers of that time had so latinized the english language that the pure english idiom which shakespeare generally follows has all the air of novelty which other writers are used to affect by foreign phraseology  in short the articles here enumerated are but so many ways of departing from the usual and simpler forms of speech without neglecting too much the grace of ease and perspicuity in which welltempered license one of the greatest charms of all poetry but especially of shakespeares poetry consists not that he was always and every where so happy his expression sometimes and by the very means here exemplified becomes hard obscure and unnatural this is the extreme on the other side but in general we may say that he has either followed the direction of horace very ably or has hit upon his rule very happily     the straitlacd cethegi cinctutis cethegis jason de nores differs and i think very justly from those who interpret cinctutis to signify loose bare or naked  exertos and nudos the plain sense of the radical word cingo is directly opposite the word cinctutis is here assumed to express a severity of manners by an allusion to an antique gravity of dress and the poet adds de nores very happily forms a new word himself as a vindication and example of the license he recommends cicero numbers m corn cethegus among the old roman orators and horace himself again refers to the cethegi in his epistle to florus and on the subject of the use of words  obscurata diu papulo bonus eruet atque proferet in lucem speciosa vocabula rerum quae priscis memorata catonibus atque cethegic nunc situs informis premit and deserta vetustas adsciscet nova quae genitor produxerit usus mark where a bold expressive phrase appears bright through the rubbish of some hundred years command old words that long have slept to wake words that wise bacon or brave raleigh spoke or bid the new be english ages hence for use will father what is begot by sense pope this brilliant passage of pope is quoted in this place by the author of the english commentary who has also subjoined many excellent remarks on the revival of old words worthy the particular attention of those who cultivate prose as well as poetry and showing at large that the riches of a language are actually increased by retaining its old words and besides they have often a greater real weight and dignity than those of a more fashionable cast which succeed to them this needs no proof to such as are versed in the earlier writings of any language   the growing prevalency of a very different humor first catched as it should seem from our commerce with the french models and countenanced by the too scrupulous delicacy of some good writers amongst ourselves had gone far toward unnerving the noblest modern language and effeminating the public taste  the rejection of old wards as barbarous and of many modern ones as unpolite had so exhausted the strength and stores of our language that it was high time for some masterhand to interpose and send us for supplies to our old poets which there is the highest authority for saying no one ever despised but for a reason not very consistent with his credit to avow rudem esse omnino in nostris poetis aut inertissimae nequitiae est aut fastidii delicatissimi  cic de sin l i c    as branching woods etc ut silvae foliis etc mr duncombe in his translation of our author concurs with monsieur dacier in observing that horace seems here to have had in view that fine similitude of homer in the sixth book of the iliad comparing the generations of men to the annual succession of leaves      like leaves on trees the race of man is found now green in youth now withering on the ground another race the following spring supplies they fall successive and successive rise so generations in their turns decay so flourish these when those are past away pope the translator of homer has himself compared words to leaves but in another view in his essay on criticism  words are like leaves and where they most abound much fruit of sense beneath is rarely found in another part of the essay he pursues the same train of thought with horace and rises i think above his master  short is the date alas of modern rhymes and it is but just to let them live betimes no longer now that golden age appears when patriarchwits survived a thousand years now length of fame our second life is lost and bare threescore is all even that can boast our sons their fathers failing language see and such as chaucer is shall dryden be so when the faithful pencil has designed some bright idea of the masters mind where a new world leaps out at his command and ready nature waits upon his hand when the ripe colors soften and unite and sweetly melt into just shade and light when mellowing years their full perfection give and each bold figure just begins to live the treacherous colors the fair art betray and all the bright creation fades away essay on criticism     whether the sea etc sive receptus etc  this may be understood of any harbor but it is generally interpreted to refer to the portus julius a haven formed by letting in the sea upon the lucrine lake and forming a junction between that and the lake avernus a work commenced by julius caesar and completed by augustus or agrippa under his auspices regis opus both these lakes says martin were in campania the former was destroyed by an earthquake but the latter is the present lago daverno strabo the geographer who as well as our poet was living at the time ascribes this work to agrippa and tells us that the lucrine bay was separated from the tyrrhene sea by a mound said to have been first made by hercules and restored by agrippa philargyrius says that a storm arose at the time of the execution of this great work to which virgil seems to refer in his mention of this port in the course of his panegyric on italy in the second georgick  an memorem portus lucrinoque addita claustra atque indignatum magnis stridoribus aequor julia qua ponto long sonat unda refuso tyrrhenusque fretis immittitur aestus avernis or shall i praise thy ports or mention make of the vast mound that binds the lucrine lake or the disdainful sea that shut from thence roars round the structure and invades the fence there where secure the julian waters glide or where avernus jaws admit the tyrrhene tide dryden     whether the marsh etc sterilisve palus  the pontine marsh first drained by the consul cornelius cethegus then by augustus and many many years after by theodorick   0   or if the river etc seu cursum etc the course of the tyber changed by augustus to prevent inundations    0  for deeds of kings etc res gestae regumque etc  the ingenious author of the english commentary to whom i have so often referred and to whom i must continue to refer has discovered particular taste judgment and address in his explication of this part of the epistle it runs thus  from reflections on poetry at large he proceeds now to particulars the most obvious of which being the different forms and measures of poetic composition he considers in this view from v    to    the four great species of poetry to which all others may be reduced the epick elegiack dramatick and lyrick but the distinction of the measure to be observed in the several species is so obvious that there can scarcely be any mistake about them the difficulty is to know from v    to    how far each may partake of the spirit of the other without destroying that natural and necessary difference which ought to subsist betwixt them all to explain this which is a point of great nicety he considers from v    to    the case of dramatick poetry the two species of which are as distinct from each other as any two can be and yet there are times when the features of the one will be allowed to resemble those of the other  but the poet had a further view in choosing this instance for he gets by this means into the main of his subject which was dramatick poetry and by the most delicate transition imaginable proceeds from    to     to deliver a series of rules interspersed with historical accounts and enlivened by digressions for the regulation of the roman stage it is needless to insist that my hypothesis will not allow me to concur entirely in the latter part of this extract at least in that latitude to which the system of the writer carries it yet i perfectly agree with mr duncombe that the learned critic in his observation on this epistle has shown in general the connection and dependence of one part with another in a clearer light than any other commentator his shrewd and delicate commentary is indeed a most elegant contrast to the barbarous analysis of scaliger drawn up without the least idea of poetical transition and with the uncouth air of a mere dry logician or dull grammarian i think however the order and method observed in this epistle is stricter than has yet been observed and that the series of rules is delivered with great regularity not enlivened by digressions but passing from one topic to another by the most natural and easy transitions the authors discrimination of the different styles of the several species of poetry leads him as has been already shown to consider the diction of the drama and its accommodation to the circumstances and character of the speaker a recapitulation of these circumstances carries him to treat of the due management of characters already known as well as of sustaining those that are entirely original to the first of which the poet gives the preference recommending known characters as well as known subjects and on the mention of this joint preference the author leaves further consideration of the diction and slides into discourse upon the fable which he continues down to the    d versa atque ita mentitur sic veris falsa remiscet primo ne medium medio ne discrepet imum having dispatched the fable the poet proceeds and with some solemnity of order to the consideration of the characters not in regard to suitable diction for of that he has already spoken but in respect to the manners and in this branch of his subject he has as judiciously borrowed from the rhetoricks of aristotle as in the rest of his epistle from the poeticks he then directs in its due place the proper conduct of particular incidents of the fable after which he treats of the chorus from whence he naturally falls into the history of theatrical music which is as naturally succeeded by an account of the origin of the drama itself which the poet commences like his master aristotle even from the dithyrambick song and carries it down to the establishment of the new greek comedy from whence he passes easily and gracefully to the roman stage acknowledging the merits of the writers but pointing out their defects and assigning the causes he then subjoins a few general observations and concludes his long discourse on the drama having extended it to     lines this discourse together with the result of all his reflections on poets and poetry he then applies in the most earnest and personal manner to the elder piso and with a long and most pathetick peroration if i may adopt an oratorical term concludes the epistle       the elegys small song exiguos elegos  commentators differ concerning the import of this expression  exiguos elegos the elegys small song de nores schrevelius and desprez think it refers to the humility of the elegiack style and subjects compared with epick or lyrick sublimity monsieur dacier rather thinks that horace refers here as in the words versibus impariter junctis couplets unequal to the use of the pentameter or short verse consisting of five feet and joined to the hexameter or long verse of six this inequality of the couplet monsieur dacier justly prefers to the two long alexandrines of his own country which sets almost all the french poetry epick dramatick elegiack or satyrick to the tune of derry down in our language the measures are more various and more happily conceived our elegy adopts not only unequal couplets but alternate rhymes which give a plaintive tone to the heroic measure and are most happily used in grays beautiful elegy in a country church yard       thy feast thyestes coena thyestae  the story of thyestes being of the most tragic nature a banquet on his own children is commonly interpreted by the critics as mentioned by horace in allusion to tragedy in general the author of the english commentary however is of a different opinion supposing from a passage of cicero that the poet means to glance at the thyestes of ennius and to pay an oblique compliment to varius who had written a tragedy on the same subject  the same learned critic also takes it for granted that the tragedy of telephus and probably of peleus after mentioned point at tragedies of euripides on these subjects translated into latin and accommodated to the roman stage without success by ennius accius or noevius  one of the criticks notes on this part of the epistle treating on the use of pure poetry in the drama abounds with curious disquisition and refined criticism    0  they must have passion too dulcia sunto the poet with great address includes the sentiments under the consideration of diction  effert animi motus interpret lingua forces expression from the faithful tongue buckingham has treated the subject of dialogue very happily in his essay on poetry glancing but not servilely at this part of horace  figures of speech which poets think so fine arts needless varnish to make nature shine are all but paint upon a beauteous face and in descriptions only claim a place but to make rage declaim and grief discourse from lovers in despair fine things to force must needs succeed for who can choose but pity a dying hero miserably witty      and orestes mad tristis orestes tristis is not literally mad but phrenzy is the general poetic and dramatick attribute of orestes to which horace is by all the commentators supposed to refer tristis in its common acceptance would be too little discriminated from the flebilis ino   0   be not your opening fierce nec sic incipies most of the critics observe that all these documents deduced from the epick are intended like the reduction of the iliad into acts as directions and admonitions to the dramatick writer nam si in epopaeia quae gravitate omnia poematum genera praecellit ait principium lene esse debere quanto magis in tragoedia et comoedia idem videri debet says de nores praeceptum de initio grandiori evitando quod tam epicus quam tragicus cavere debet says the dauphin editor il faut se souvenir qu horace applique a la tragedy les regles du poem epique car si ces debuts eclatans sont ridicules dans la poem epique ils le sont encore plus dans la tragedy says dacier the author of the english commentary makes the like observation and uses it to enforce his system of the epistles being intended as a criticism on the roman drama   0   like the rude balladmonger s chaunt of old ut scriptor cyclicus olim scriptor cyclicus signifies an itinerant rhymer traveling like shakespeares mad tom to wakes and fairs and market towns it is not precisely known who was the cyclick poet here meant some have ascribed the character to maevius and roscommon has adopted that idea  whoever vainly on his strength depends begins like virgil but like maevius ends that wretch in spite of his forgotten rhimes condemned to live to all succeeding times with pompous nonsense and a bellowing sound sung lofty ilium tumbling to the ground and if my muse can through past ages see that noisy nauseous gaping fool was he exploded when with universal scorn the mountains labored and a mouse was born essay on translated

maty did not perceive that the irregularity of this verse was intentional in other instances i have endeavored to avail myself of his remarks    0    diomeds return  the double egg  the return of diomede is not mentioned by homer but is said to be the subject of a tedious poem by antimachus and to stasimus is ascribed a poem called the little iliad beginning with the nativity of helen       hear now tu quid ego etc  this invocation says dacier justly is not addressed to either of the pisos but to the dramatick writer generally       the cloth goes down aulaea manentis this is translated according to modern manners for with the ancients the cloth was raised at the conclusion of the play thus in virgils georgicks vel scena ut versis discedatfrontibus atque purpurea intexti tollant aulaea britanni where the proud theaters disclose the scene which interwoven britons seem to raise and show the triumph which which shame displays dryden       mans several ages etc aetatis cujusque etc jason de nores takes notice of the particular stress that horace lays on the due discrimination of the several ages by the solemnity with which he introduces the mention of them the same critic subjoins a note also which i shall transcribe as it serves to illustrate a popular passage in the as you like it of shakespeare  all the worlds a stage and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts his acts being seven ages at first the infant mewling and puking in the nurses arms and then the whining schoolboy with his satchel and shining morningface creeping like snail unwillingly to school and then the lover sighing like furnace with a woeful ballad made to his mistress eyebrow then a soldier full of strange

of man into seven ages viz infancy childhood puberty youth manhood old age and decrepitude which last says de nores in some sort answers to infancy or as shakespere expresses it is second childishness  before shakespeares time says warburton seven acts was no unusual division of a play so that there is a greater beauty than appears at first sight in this image mr steevens however informs us that the plays of that early period were not divided into acts at all it is most probable therefore that shakespeare only copied the moral philosophy the socraticae chartae of his own day adapting it like aristotle and horace to his own purpose and i think with more felicity than either of his illustrious predecessors by contriving to introduce and discriminate every one of the seven ages this he has effected by assigning station and character to some of the stages which to aristotle and horace appeared too similar to be distinguished from each other thus puberty youth manhood and old age become under shakespeares hand the lover the soldier the justice and the lean and slipperd pantaloon while the natutural qualities of the infant the boy and the dotard afford sufficient materials for poetical description       thus years advancing many comforts bring and flying bear off many on their wing multa ferunt anni venientes commoda secum multa recedentes adimunt aristotle considers the

chorus it should thenceforth one would think have become a fundamental rule and maxim of the stage and so indeed it appeared to some few writers the most admired of the french tragic poets ventured to introduce it into two of his latter plays and with such success that as one observes it should in all reason have disabused his countrymen on this head lessai heureux de m racine qui les choeurs a

vol ii p     whence it has come to pass that the chorus has been thus neglected is not now the enquiry but that this critic and all such are greatly out in their judgments when they presume to censure it in the ancients must appear if we look no further from the double use insisted on by the poet for   a chorus interposing and bearing a part in the progress of the action gives the representation

every man of sense perceives and feels the want of upon our stage a want which nothing but such an expedient as the chorus can possibly relieve and   the importance of its other office l     to the utility of the representation is so great that in a moral view nothing can compensate for this deficiency for it is necessary to the truth and decorum of characters that the manners bad as well as good be drawn in strong vivid colors and to that end that immoral sentiments forcibly expressed and speciously maintained be sometimes imputed to the speakers hence the sound philosophy of the chorus will be constantly wanting to rectify the wrong conclusions of the audience and prevent the ill impressions that might otherwise be made upon it nor let any one say that the audience is well able to do this for itself euripides did not find even an athenian theater so quicksighted the story is well known sen ep     that when this painter of the manners was obliged by the rules of his art and the character to be sustained to put a run of bold sentiments in the mouth of one of his persons the people instantly took fire charging the poet with the imputed villainy as though it had been his own now if such an audience could so easily misinterpret an attention to the truth of character into the real doctrine of the poet and this too when a chorus was at hand to correct and disabuse their judgments what must be the case when the whole is left to the sagacity and penetration of the people the wiser sort it is true have little need of this information yet the reflections of sober sense on the course and occurrences of the representation clothed in the noblest dress of poetry and enforced by the joint powers of harmony and action which is the true character of the chorus might make it even to such a no unpleasant or unprofitable entertainment but these two are a small part of the uses of the chorus which in every light is seen so important to the truth decorum and dignity of the tragic scene that the modern stage which has not thought proper to adopt it is even with the advantage of sometimes the justest moral painting and sublimest imagery but a very faint shadow of the old as must needs appear to those who have looked into the ancient models or divesting themselves of modern prejudices are disposed to consult the dictates of plain sense for the use of such i once designed to have drawn into one view the several important benefits arising to the drama from the observance of this rule but have the pleasure to find myself prevented by a sensible dissertation of a good french writer which the reader will find in the viii tom of the history of the academy of inscriptions and belles lettres  or it may be sufficient to refer the english reader to the late tragedies of elfrida and caractacus which do honor to modern poetry and are a better apology than any i could make for the ancient chorus   notes on the art of poetry this and all the extracts which are quoted notes on the art of poetry are taken from the author of the english commentary  though it is not my intention to agitate in this place the long disputed question concerning the expediency or inexpediency of the chorus yet i cannot dismiss the above note without some farther observation in the first place then i cannot think that the judgment of two such crikicks as aristotle and horace can be decisively quoted as concurring with the practice of wise antiquity to establish the chorus neither of these two critics have taken up the question each of them giving directions for the proper conduct of the chorus considered as an established and received part of tragedy and indeed originally as they both tell us the whole of it aristotle in his poeticks has hot said much on the subject and from the little he has said more arguments might perhaps be drawn in favor of the omission than for the introduction of the chorus it is true that he says in his  th chapter that tragedy after many changes paused having gained its natural form   this might at first sight seem to include his approbation of the chorus as well as of all the other parts of tragedy then in use but he himself expressly tells us in the very same chapter that he had no such meaning saying that to enquire whether tragedy be perfect in its parts either considered in itself or with relation to the theater was foreign to his present purpose   in the passage from which horace has in the verses now before us described the office and laid down the duties of the chorus the passage referred to by the learned critic the words of aristotle are not particularly favorable to the institution or much calculated to recommend the use of it for aristotle there informs us that sophocles alone of all the grecian writers made the chorus conducive to the progress of the fable not only even euripides being culpable in this instance but other writers after the example of agathon introducing odes as little to the purpose as if they had borrowed whole scenes from another play    on the whole therefore whatever may be the merits or advantages of the chorus i cannot think that the judgment of aristotle or horace can be adduced in recommendation of it as to the probability given to the representation by the chorus interposing and bearing a part in the action the public who have lately seen a troop of singers assembled on the stage as a chorus during the whole representations of elfrida and caractacus are competent to decide for themselves how far such an expedient gives a more striking resemblance of human life than the common usage of our drama as to its importance in a moral view to correct the evil impression of vicious sentiments imputed to the speakers the story told to enforce its use for this purpose conveys a proof of its inefficacy to give due force to sentiments as well as to direct their proper tendency arises from the skill and address of the poet independent of the chorus  monsieur dacier as well as the author of the above note censures the modern stage for having rejected the chorus and having lost thereby at least half its probability and its greatest ornament so that our tragedy is but a very faint shadow of the old learned critics however do not perhaps consider that if it be expedient to revive the chorus all the other parts of the ancient tragedy must be revived along with it aristotle mentions music as one of the six parts of tragedy and horace no sooner introduces the chorus but he proceeds to the pipe and lyre if a chorus be really necessary our dramas like those of the ancients should be rendered wholly musical the dancers also will then claim their place and the pretensions of vestris and noverre must be admitted as classical such a spectacle if not more natural than the modern would at least be consistent but to introduce a groupe of spectatorial actors speaking in one part of the drama and singing in another is as strange and incoherent a medley and full as unclassical as the dialogue and airs of the beggars opera       chaunting no odes between the acts that seem unapt or foreign to the general theme nec quid medios etc on this passage the author of the english commentary thus remarks how necessary this advice might be to the writers of the augustan age cannot certainly appear but if the practice of seneca may give room for suspicion it should seem to have been much wanted in whom i scarcely believe there is one single instance of the chorus being employed in a manner consonant to its true end and character  the learned critic seems here to believe and the plays under the name of seneca in some measure warrant the conclusion that the chorus of the roman stage was not calculated to answer the ends of its institution aristotle has told us just the same thing with an exception in favor of sophocles of the grecian drama and are such surmises or such information likely to strengthen our prejudices on behalf of the chorus or to inflame our desires for its revival       let it to virtue prove a guide and friend ille bonis faveatque etc the chorus says the poet is to take the side of the good and virtuous i e is always to sustain a moral character but this will need some explanation and restriction to conceive aright of its office we must suppose the chorus to be a number of persons by some probable cause assembled together as witnesses and spectators of the great action of the drama such persons as they cannot be wholly uninterested in what passes before them will very naturally bear some share in the representation this will principally consist in declaring their sentiments and indulging their reflections freely on the several events and distresses as they shall arise thus we see the moral attributed to the chorus will be no other than the dictates of plain sense such as must be obvious to every thinking observer of the action who is under the influence of no peculiar partialities from affection or interest though even these may be supposed in cases where the character toward which they draw is represented as virtuous  a chorus thus constituted must always it is evident take the part of virtue because this is the natural and almost necessary determination of mankind in all ages and nations when acting freely and unconstrained  notes on the art of poetry      faithful and secret  ille tegat commissa  on this nice part of the duty of the chorus the author of the english commentary thus remarks  this important advice is not always easy to be followed much indeed will depend on the choice of the subject and the artful constitution of the fable yet with all his care the ablest writer will sometimes find himself embarrassed by the chorus i would here be understood to speak chiefly of the moderns for the ancients though it has not been attended to had some peculiar advantages over us in this respect resulting from the principles and practices of those times for as it has been observed of the ancient epic muse that she borrowed much of her state and dignity from the false theology of the pagan world so i think it may be justly said of the ancient tragic that she has derived great advantages of probability from its mistaken moral if there be truth in this reflection it will help to justify some of the ancient choirs that have been most objected to by the moderns after two examples from euripides in one of which the trusty chorus conceals the premeditated suicide of phaedra and in the other abets medeas intended murder of her children both which are most ably vindicated by the critic the note concludes in these words  in sum though these acts of severe avenging justice might not be according to the express letter of the laws or the more refined conclusions of the porch or academy yet there is no doubt that they were in the general account esteemed fit and reasonable and it is to be observed in order to pass a right judgment on the ancient chorus that though in virtue of their office they were obliged universally to sustain a moral character yet this moral was rather political and popular than strictly legal or philosophic which is also founded on good reason the scope and end of the ancient theater being to serve the interests of virtue and society on the principles and sentiments already spread and admitted amongst the people and not to correct old errors and instruct them in philosophic truth one of the censurers of euripides whose opinion is controverted in the above note is monsieur dacier who condemns the chorus in this instance as not only violating their moral office but transgressing the laws of nature and of god by a fidelity so vicious and criminal that these women  the chorus ought to fly away in the car of medea to escape the punishment due to them the annotator above agrees with the greek scholiast that the corinthian women  the chorus being free properly desert the interests of creon and keep medeas secrets for the sake of justice according to their custom dacier however urges an instance of their infidelity in the ion of euripides where they betray the secret of xuthus to creusa which the french critic defends on account of their attachment to their mistress and adds that the rule of horace like other rules is proved by the exception besides continues the critic in the true spirit of french gallantry should we so heavily accuse the poet for not having made an assembly of women keep a secret dailleurs peut on fair un si grand crime a un poet de navoir pas fait en sort quune troop de femmes guard un secret he then concludes his note with blaming euripides for the perfidy of iphigenia at tauris who abandons these faithful guardians of her secret by flying alone with orestes and leaving them to the fury of thoas to which they must have been exposed but for the intervention of minerva  on the whole it appears that the moral importance of the chorus must be considered with some limitations or at least that the chorus is as liable to be misused and misapplied as any part of modern tragedy   00  the pipe of old  tibi non ut nunc etc  this says the author of the english commentary is one of those many passages in the epistle about which the critics have said a great deal without explaining any thing in support of what i mean to offer as the true interpretation i observe  that the poets intention certainly was not to censure the false refinements of their stagemusic but in a short digressive history such as the didactic form will sometimes require to describe the rise and progress of the true this i collect   from the expression itself which cannot without violence be understood in any other way for as to the words licentia and praeceps which have occasioned much of the difficulty the first means a freer use not a licentiousness properly so called and the other only expresses a vehemence and rapidity of language naturally productive of a quicker elocution such as must of course attend the more numerous harmony of the lyre  not as m dacier translates it une eloquence temeraire et outree an extravagant straining and affectation of style   from the reason of the thing which makes it incredible that the music of the theater should then be most complete when the times were barbarous and entertainments of this kind little encouraged or understood   from the character of that music itself for the rudeness of which horace in effect apologizes in defending it only on the score of the imperfect state of the stage and the simplicity of its judges  the above interpretation of this part of the epistle is in my opinion extremely just and exactly corresponds with the explication of de nores who censures madius for an error similar to that of dacier non recte sentire videtur madius dum putat potius in romanorum luxuriam invectum horatium quam de melodiae incremento tractasse  the music having always been a necessary appendage to the chorus i cannot as has already been hinted in the note on l  00 of this version consider the poets notice of the pipe and lyre as a digression notwithstanding it includes a short history of the rude simplicity of the music in the earlier ages of rome and of its subsequent improvements the chorus too being originally the whole as well as afterward a legitimate part of tragedy the poet naturally traces the drama from its origin to its most perfect state in greece and afterward compares its progress and improvements with the theater of his own country such is i think the natural and easy method pursued by horace though it differs in some measure from the order and connection pointed out by the author of the english commentary       for what alas could the unpracticed ear of rusticks revelling over country cheer a motley groupe high low and froth and scum distinguish but shrill squeak and dronish hum  indoctus quid enim saperet liberque laborum rusticus urbano canfusus turpis honesto these lines rather breaking in upon the continuity of the history of theatrical music create some obscurity which has given birth to various interpretations the author of the english commentary who always endeavors to dive to the very bottom of his subject understands this couplet of horace as a sneer on those grave philosophers who considered these refinements of the music as corruptions he interprets the passage at large and explains the above two lines in these words nor let it be objected than this freer harmony was itself an abuse a corruption of the severe and moral music of ancient times alas we were not as yet so wise to see the inconveniences of this improvement and how should we considering the nature and end of these theatrical entertainments and the sort of men of which our theaters were made up  this interpretation is ingenious but jason de nores gives i think a more easy and unforced explanation of this difficult passage by supposing it to refer by way of parenthesis to what had just been said of the original rude simplicity of the roman theatrical music which says the poet was at least as polished and refined as the taste of the audience this de nores urges in two several notes both which i shall submit to the reader leaving it to him to determine how far i am to be justified in having adapted my version to his interpretation  the first of these notes contains at large his reproof of madius for having like dacier supposed the poet to censure the improvements that he manifestly meant to commend  quare non recte videtur sentire madius dum putat potius in romanorum luxuriam invectum horatium quam de melodiae incremento tractasse cum seipsum interpretans quid sibi voluerit per haec luce clarius ostendat tibia non ut nunc orichalco vincta tubaeque aemula et sic priscae motumque and luxuriam addidit arti tibicen traxitque vagus per pulpita vestem sic etiam fidibus voces crevere severis et tulit eloquium insolitum facundia praeceps   ad quid enim tam longa digresione extra rem propositam in romanos inveheretur cum de iis nihil aliud dicat quam eos genio ac voluptatibus indulgere cum potius veteres romanos insimulare videatur ignorantiae quod ignoraverint soni et musices venustatem et jucunditatem illa priori scilicet incondita et rudi admodum contenti dum ait indoctus quid enim superet liberque laborum rusticus urbano confusus turpis honesto   the other note is expressly applied by way of comment on this passage itself  indoctus quidenim saperet reddit rationem quasi per digressionem occurrens tacitae objectioni quare antea apud romanos musica melodia parva aut nulla pene fuerat quia inquit indocti ignarique rerum omnium veteres illi nondum poterant judicare de melodia utpote apud eos re nova atque inusitata neque illius jucunditatem degustare quibus verbis imperitiam eorum rusticitatemque demonstrat upon the whole de nores appears to me to have given the true sense of the passage i am no friend to licentious transpositions or arbitrary variations of an authors text yet i confess i was strongly tempted in order to elucidate this perplexed passage to have carried these two lines of horace four lines back and to have inserted them immediately after the  0 th verse  et frugi castus verecundusque coibat the english reader who wishes to try the experiment is desired to read the four lines that compose my version immediately after the  0 th line  with modest mirth indulged their sober taste   0  the piper grown luxuriant in his art      now too its powers increased the lyre severe sic priscae  arti tibicen etc sic fidibus etc this is the application of what has been said in general concerning the refinement of theatrical music to the case of tragedy some commentators say and to comedy but in this they mistake as will appear presently m dacier has i know not what conceit about a comparison betwixt the roman and greek stage his reason is that the lyre was used in the greek chorus as appears he says from sophocles himself playing upon this instrument himself in one of his tragedies and was it not used too in the roman chorus as appears from neros playing upon it in several tragedies but the learned critic did not apprehend this matter indeed from the caution with which his guides the dealers in antiquities always touch this point it should seem that they too had no very clear conceptions of it the case i take to have been this the tibia as being most proper to accompany the declamation of the acts cantanti succinere was constantly employed as well in the roman tragedy as comedy this appears from many authorities i mention only two from cicero quam multa acad l ii   quae nos fugiunt in cantu exaudiunt in eo genere exercitati qui primo inflatu tibicinis antiopam esse aiunt aut andromacham cum nos ne suspicemur quidem the other is still more express in his piece entitled orator speaking of the negligence of the roman writers in respect of numbers he observes that there were even many passages in their tragedies which unless the tibia played to them could not be dlstinguished from mere prose quae nisi cum tibicen accesserit orationi sint solutoe simillima one of these passages is expressly quoted from thyestes a tragedy of ennius and as appears from the measure taken out of one of the acts it is clear then that the tibia was certainly used in the declamation of tragedy but now the song of the tragic chorus being of the nature of the ode of course required fides the lyre the peculiar and appropriated instrument of the lyric muse and this is clearly collected if not from express testimonies yet from some occasional hints dropped by the ancients for   the lyre we are told cic de leg ii   and    and is agreed on all hands was an instrument of the roman theater but it was not employed in comedy this we certainly know from the short account of the music prefixed to terences plays   further the tibicen as we saw accompanied the declamation of the acts in tragedy it remains then that the proper place of the lyre was where one should naturally look for it in the songs of the chorus but we need not go further than this very passage for a proof it is unquestionable that the poet is here speaking of the chorus only the following lines not admitting any other possible interpretation by fidibus then is necessarily understood the instrument peculiarly used in it not that it need be said that the tibia was never used in the chorus the contrary seems expressed in a passage of seneca ep lxxxiv and in julius pollux l iv     0  it is sufficient if the lyre was used solely or principally in it at this time in this view the whole digression is more pertinent and connects better the poet had before been speaking of tragedy all his directions from l  00 respect this species of the drama only the application of what he had said concerning music is then most naturally made   to the tibia the music of the acts and   to fides that of the choir thus confining himself as the tenor of this part required to tragedy only hence is seen the mistake not only of m dacier whose comment is in every view insupportable but as was hinted of heinsius lambin and others who with more probability explained this of the roman comedy and tragedy for though tibia might be allowed to stand for comedy as opposed to tragoedia as in fact we find it in l ii ep     that being the only instrument employed in it yet in speaking expressly of the music of the stage fides could not determinately enough and in contradistinction to tibia denote that of tragedy it being an instrument used solely or principally in the chorus of which the context shows he alone speaks it is further to be observed that in the application here made besides the music the poet takes in the other improvements of the tragic chorus these happening as from the nature of the thing they would do at the same time  notes on the art of poetry      with dance and flowing vest embellishes his part traxitque vagus per pulpita vestem this expresses not only the improvement arising from the ornament of proper dresses but from the grace of motion not only the actor whose peculiar office it was but the minstrel himself as appears from hence conforming his gesture in some sort to the music  of the use and propriety of these gestures or dances it will not be easy for us who see no such things attempted on the modern stage to form any very clear or exact notions what we cannot doubt of is   that the several theatrical dances of the ancients were strictly conformable to the genius of the different species of composition to which they were applied   that therefore the tragic dance which more especially accompanied the chorus must have been expressive of the highest gravity and decorum tending to inspire ideas of what is becoming graceful and majestic in which view we cannot but perceive the important assistance it must needs lend to virtue and how greatly it must contribute to set all her graces and attractions in the fairest light   this idea of the ancient tragic dance is not solely formed upon our knowledge of the conformity beforementioned but is further collected from the name usually given to it which was  this word cannot well be translated into our language but expresses all that grace and concinnity of motion which the dignity of the choral song required   lastly it must give us a very high notion of the moral effect of this dance when we find the severe plato admitting it into his commonwealth  notes on the art of poetry      he who the prize a filthy goat to gain at first contended in the tragic strain carmine qui tragico vilem certavit ob hircum if i am not greatly deceived all the editors and commentators on this epistle have failed to observe that the historical part of it relative to the grecian drama commences at this verse all of them supposing it to begin    lines further in the epistle on the mention of thespis whom horace as clearly as correctly describes to be the first improver not inventor of tragedy whose original he marks here much confusion has i think arisen from this oversight as i shall endeavor to explain in the following notes only observing in this place that the poet having spoken particularly of all the parts of tragedy now enters with the strictest order and greatest propriety into its general history which by his strictures on the chorus he most elegantly as well as forcibly connects with his subject taking occasion to speak incidentally of other branches of the drama particularly the satyrs and the old comedy       soon too  though rude the graver mood unbroke stripped the rough satyrs and essayed a joke mox etiam agrestes satyros etc it is not the intention of these notes to retail the accounts of others i must therefore refer the reader for whatever concerns the history of the satiric as i have hitherto done of the tragic and comic drama to the numerous dissertators on the ancient stage and above all in the case before us to the learned casaubon from whom all that has been said to any purpose by modern writers has been taken only it will be proper to observe one or two particulars which have been greatly misunderstood and without which it will be impossible in any tolerable manner to explain what follows  i the design of the poet in these lines is not to fix the origin of the satyric piece in ascribing the invention of it to thespis this has been concluded without the least warrant from his own words which barely tell us that the representation of tragedy was in elder greece followed by the satires and indeed the nature of the thing as well as the testimony of all antiquity shows it to be impossible for the satire here spoken of is in all respects a regular drama and therefore could not be of earlier date than the times of aeschylus when the constitution of the drama was first formed it is true indeed there was a kind of entertainment of much greater antiquity which by the ancients is sometimes called satyric out of which as aristotle assures us tragedy itself arose  but then this was nothing but a chorus of satyrs athenaeus l xiv celebrating the festivals of bacchus with rude songs and uncouth dances and had little resemblance to that which was afterward called satiric which except that it retained the chorus of satyrs and turned upon some subject relative to bacchus was of a quite different structure and in every respect as regular a composition as tragedy itself  ii there is no doubt but the poem here distinguished by the name of satyri was in actual use on the roman stage this appears from the turn of the poets whole criticism upon it particularly his address to the pisos l     and his observation of the offense which a loose dialogue in this drama would give to a roman auditory l     make it evident that he had in fact the practice of his own stage in view  iii for the absolute merit of these satires the reader will judge of it himself by comparing the cyclops the only piece of this kind remaining to us from antiquity with the rules here delivered by horace only it may be observed in addition to what the reader will find elsewhere  n l     apologized in its favor that the double character of the satires admirably fitted it as well for a sensible entertainment to the wise as for the sport and diversion of the vulgar for while the grotesque appearance and jesting vein of these fantastic personages amused the one the other saw much further and considered them at the same time as replete with science and informed by a spirit of the most abstruse wisdom hence important lessons of civil prudence interesting allusions to public affairs or a high refined moral might with the highest probability be insinuated under the slight cover of a rustic simplicity and from this instructive cast which from its nature must be very obscure if not impenetrable to us at this day was i doubt not derived the principal pleasure which the ancients found in this species of the drama if the modern reader would conceive any thing of the nature and degree of this pleasure he may in part guess at it from reflecting on the entertainment he himself receives from the characters of the clowns in shakespeare who as the poet himself has characterized them use their folly like a stalking horse and under the presentation of that shoot their wit as you like it   notes on the art of poetry this learned note i think sets out with a misapprehension of the meaning of horace by involving his instructions on the satyrick drama with his account of its origin nor does he in the most distant manner insinuate though dacier has asserted the same thing that the satyrs owed their first introduction to thespis but relates that the very poets who contended in the goatsong to which tragedy owes its name finding it too solemn and severe an entertainment for their rude holiday audience interspersed the grave strains of tragedy with comic and satirical interludes producing thereby a kind of medley something congenial to what has appeared on our own stage under the name of tragicomedy nor if i am able to read and comprehend the context do the words of horace tell us that the representation of tragedy was in elder greece followed by the satyrs the satyrs composed a part of the tragedy in its infancy as well as in the days of horace if his own words may be quoted as authority on any other construction his directions concerning the conduct of the god or hero of the piece are scarcely reconcilable to common sense and it is almost impossible to mark their being incorporated with the tragedy in more expressive terms or images than by his solicitude to prevent their broad mirth from contaminating its dignity or purity  effutire leves indigna tragaedia versus ut festis matrona moveri jussa diebus intererit satyris paulum pudibunda protervis the cyclops of euripides the only satyrick drama extant written at a much later period than that of which horace speaks in this place cannot i think convey to us a very exact idea of the tragic pastorals whose origin he here describes the cyclops scarce exceeding  00 lines might be played according to the idea of some critics after another performance but that cannot without the greatest violence to the text be supposed of the satyrick piece here mentioned by horace the idea of farces or afterpieces though an inferior branch of the drama is in fact among the refinements of an improved age the writers of an early period throw their dramatick materials serious and ludicrous into one mass which the critical chemistry of succeeding times separates and refines the modern stage like the ancient owed its birth to the ceremonies of religion from mysteries and moralities it proceeded to more regular dramas diversifying their serious scenes like the satyrick poets with ludicrous representations this desire of variety was one cause of the irregularity as well as extraordinary length of their pieces of which i believe they never gave above one at the same time of representation farce is in point of age as well as rank but a younger brother of the theater  other critics have taken the text of horace in the same sense that i have here considered it  agrestes satyros silvestres faunos nudos introduxit ita enim satyros vocant  quod vero satyros in fabulos inductos dixi non peracta id fabula factum fuisse intelligendum sed in medio fabulae quasi choros nannius  satyros puto iterum romae inductos atque ideo de his loqui horatium cujusmodi illis sermonem tribuere debeamus and quemadmodum primum et qua de causa inducti sunt ostendentem quare cum de satyrorum choris public in spectaculo inductis test etiam dionysio halicarnasseo minime dubium sit etiam postea inter medios actus tragaediarum adhibitos credibile est  de nores agrestes satyros hos autem loco chori introductos intelligit non ut quidam volunt in ipsa tragoedia cum praesertim dicat factum ut grata novitate detinerentur spectatores quod inter unum and alterum actum sit chori loco in tragoedia enim ipsa cum flebilis severa ac gravis sit non requiritur hujusmodi locorum ludorumque levitas quae tamen inter medios actus tolerari potest and hoc est quod ait incolumi gravitate ea enim quae fiunt quaeve dicuntur inter medios actus extra tragoediam esse intelliguntur neque imminuunt tragoediae gravitatem  de nores the distinction made by de nores of the satyrs not making a part of the tragedy but barely appearing between the acts can only signify that the tragic and comic scenes were kept apart from each other this is plain from his saying that they held the place of the chorus not sustaining their continued part in the tragic dialogue but filling their chief office of singing between the acts the ancient tragedy was one continued representation divided into acts by the chaunt of the chorus and otherwise according to modern ideas forming but one act without any interruption of the performance  these ancient satyrick songs with which the ancient tragedians endeavored to enliven the dithyrambicks gave rise to two different species of poetry their rude jests and petulant raillery engendered the satire and their sylvan character produced the pastoral      0  though rude the graver mood unbroke  stripped the rough satyrs and essayed a joke  agrestes satyros nudavit and asper incolumi gravitate jocum tentavit it has been shown that the poet could not intend in these lines to fix the origin of the satiric drama but though this be certain and the dispute concerning that point be thereby determined yet it is to be noted that he purposely describes the satire in its ruder and less polished form glancing even at some barbarities which deform the bacchic chorus which was properly the satiric piece before aeschylus had by his regular constitution of the drama introduced it under a very different form on the stage the reason of this conduct is given in n on l  0  hence the propriety of the word nudavit which lambin rightly interprets nudos introduxit satyros the poet hereby expressing the monstrous indecorum of this entertainment in its first unimproved state alluding also to this ancient character of the satire he calls him asper i e rude and petulant and even adds that his jests were intemperate and without the least mixture of gravity for thus upon the authority of a very ingenious and learned critic i explain incolumi gravitate i e rejecting every thing serious bidding farewell as we may say to all gravity thus l iii o   incolumi jove et urbe roma i e bidding farewell to jupiter capitolinus and rome agreeably to what is said just before anciliorum et nominis et togae oblitus aeternaeque vestae or as salvus is used more remarkably in martial l v  0 ennius est lectus salvo tibi roma marone et sua riserunt secula moeonidem farewell all gravity is as remote from the original sense of the words fare well as incolumi gravitate from that of incolumis or salvo marone from that of salvus   notes on the art of poetry the beginning of this note does not i think perfectly accord with what has been urged by the same critic in the note immediately preceding he there observed that the satyr here spoken of is in all respects a regular drama and therefore could not be of earlier date than the times of aeschylus  here however he allows though in subdued phrase that though this be certain and the dispute concerning that point thereby determined yet it is to be noted that he purposely describes the satyr in its rude and less polished form glancing even at some barbarities which deform the bacchic chorus which was properly the satyrick piece before aeschylus had by his regular constitution of the drama introduced it under a very different form on the stage in a subsequent note the same learned critic also says that the connecting particle verum  verum ita risores etc expresses the opposition intended between the original satyr and that which the poet approves in both these passages the ingenious commentator seems from the mere influence of the context to approach to the interpretation that i have hazarded of this passage avowedly one of the most obscure parts of the epistle  the explanation of the words incolumi gravitate in the latter part of the above note though favorable to the system of the english commentary is not only contrary to the construction of all other interpreters and i believe unwarranted by any acceptance of the word incolumis but in my opinion less elegant and forcible than the common interpretation  the line of the ode referred to incolumi jove et urbe roma was never received in the sense which the learned critic assigns to it  the dauphin editor interprets it stante urbe and capitolino jove romanos protegente   schrevelius to the same effect explains it salvo capitolio quae jovis erat seeds   these interpretations as they are certainly the most obvious seem also to be most consonant to the plain sense of the poet       for holiday spectators flushed and wild with new conceits and mummeries were beguiled quippe erat illecebris etc monsieur dacier though he allows that all that is here said by horace proves incontestibly that the satyrick piece had possession of the roman stage tout ce qu horace dit icy prouve incontestablement quil y avoit des satyrs yet thinks that horace lavished all these instructions on them chiefly for the sake of the atellane fables the author of the english commentary is of the same opinion and labors the point very assiduously i cannot however discover in any part of horaces discourse on the satyrs one expression glancing toward the atellanes though their oscan peculiarities might easily have been marked so as not to be mistaken       that god or hero of the lofty scene may not etc ne quicumque deus etc the commentators have given various explanations of this precept de nores interprets it to signify that the same actor who represented a god or hero in the tragic part of the drama must not be employed to represent a faun or sylvan in the satyrick  dacier has a strange conceit concerning the joint performance of a tragedy and atellane at one time the same god or hero being represented as the principal subject and character of both on which occasion says he the poet recommends to the author not to debase the god or hero of the tragedy by sinking his language and manners too low in the atellane whose style as well as measure should be peculiar to itself equally distant from tragedy and farce  the author of the english commentary tells us that gods and heroes were introduced as well into the satyrick as tragic drama and often the very same gods and heroes which had borne a part in the preceding tragedy a practice which horace i suppose intended by this hint to recommend as most regular  the two short notes of schrevelius in my opinion more clearly explain the sense of horace and are in these words  poema serium jocis satyricis ita commiscere  ne scilicet is qui paulo ante dei instar aut herois in scenam fuit introductus postea lacernosus prodeat on the whole supposing the satyrick piece to be tragicomick as dacier himself seems half inclined to believe the precept of horace only recommends to the author so to support his principal personage that his behavior in the satyrick scenes shall not debase the character he has sustained in the tragic no specimen remaining of the roman satyrick piece i may be permitted to illustrate the rule of horace by a brilliant example from the seriocomick histories of the sovereign of our drama the example to which i point is the character of the prince of wales in the two parts of henry the fourth such a natural and beautiful decorum is maintained in the display of that character that the prince is as discoverable in the loose scenes with falstaff and his associates as in the presence chamber or the closet after the natural though mixed dramas of shakespeare and beaumont and fletcher had prevailed on our stage it is surprising that our progress to pure tragedy and comedy should have been interrupted or disturbed by the regular monster of tragicomedy nursed by southern and dryden       never would i pisos in the sylvan scene use abject terms alone and phrases mean nonego inornata and dominantia etc the author of the english commentary proposes a conjectural emendation of horaces text  honorata instead of inornata  and accompanied with a new and elevated sense assigned to the word dominantia this last word is interpreted in the same manner by de nores most other commentators explain it to signify common words observing its analogy to the greek term  the same expression prevails in our tongue  a reigning word a reigning fashion etc the general cast of the satyr seems to render a caution against a lofty style not very necessary yet it must be acknowledged that such a caution is given by the poet exclusive of the above proposed variation  ne quicumque deus  migret in obscuras humili sermon tabernas aut dum vitat humum nubes and inania captet      davus may jest etc  davusne loquatur etc  it should seem from hence that the common characters of comedy as well as the gods and heroes of tragedy had place in the satyrick drama cultivated in the days of horace of the manner in which the ancient writers sustained the part of silenus we may judge from the cyclops of euripides and the pastorals of virgil  vossius attempts to show from some lines of this part of the epistle  ne quicumque deus etc that the satyrs were subjoined to the tragic scenes not incorporated with them and yet at the same moment he tells us and with apparent approbation that diomedes quotes our poet to prove that they were blended with each other simul ut spectator inter res tragicas seriasque satyrorum quoque jocis and lusibus delectaretur  i cannot more satisfactorily conclude all that i have to urge on the subject of the satyrick drama as here described by horace than by one more short extract from the notes of the ingenious author of the english commentary to the substance of which extract i give the most full assent  the greek drama we know had its origin from the loose licentious raillery of the rout of bacchus indulging to themselves the freest sallies of taunt and invective as would best suit to lawless natures inspirited by festal mirth and made extravagant by wine hence arose and with a character answering to this original the satiric drama the spirit of which was afterward in good measure revived and continued in the old comedy and itself preserved though with considerable alteration in the form through all the several periods of the greek stage even when tragedy which arose out of it was brought to its last perfection   0  to a short syllable a long subjoined forms an iambick foot syllaba longa brevi subjecta vocatur iambus horace having after the example of his master aristotle slightly mentioned the first rise of tragedy in the form of a choral song subjoining an account of the satyrick chorus that was soon mox etiam combined with it proceeds to speak particularly of the iambick verse which he has before mentioned generally as the measure best accommodated to the drama in this instance however the poet has trespassed against the order and method observed by his philosophical guide and by that trespass broken the thread of his history of the drama which has added to the difficulty and obscurity of this part of his epistle aristotle does not speak of the measure till he has brought tragedy through all its progressive stages from the dithyrambicks down to its establishment by aeschylus and sophocles if the reader would judge of the poetical beauty as well as logical precision of such an arrangement let him transfer this section of the epistle beginning in the original at v     and ending at     to the end of the    th line by which transposition or i am much mistaken he will not only disembarrass this historical part of it relative to the grecian stage but will pass by a much easier and more elegant transition to the poets application of the narrative to the roman drama  the english reader inclined to make the experiment must take the lines of the translation from v     to v  0  both inclusive and insert themafter v   0  in shameful silence lost the power to wound it is further to be observed that this detail on the iambick is not with strict propriety annexed to a critical history of the satyr in which as aristotle insinuates was used the capering tetrameter and as the grammarians observe trisyllabicks       pisos be grecian models etc pope has imitated and illustrated this passage  be homers works your study and delight read them by day and meditate by night thence from your judgment thence your maxims bring and trace the muses upwards to their spring still with itself compared his text peruse and let your comment be the mantuan muse essay on criticism  0   a kind of tragic ode unknown before thespis it is said invented first ignotum tragicae genus invenisse camoenae dicitur etc it is surprising that dacier who in a controversial note in refutation of heinsius has so properly remarked horaces adherence to aristotle should not have observed that his history of the drama opens and proceeds nearly in the same order aristotle indeed does not name thespis but we cannot but include his improvements among the changes to which the critic refers before tragedy acquired a permanent form under aeschylus thespis seems not only to have embodied the chorus but to have provided a theatrical apparatus for an itinerant exhibition to have furnished disguises for his performers and to have broken the continuity of the chorus by an interlocutor to whom aeschylus adding another personage thereby first created dramatick dialogue while at the same time by a further diminution of the chorus by improving the dresses of the actors and drawing them from their traveling wagon to a fixed stage he created a regular theater  it appears then that neither horace nor aristotle ascribe the origin of tragedy to thespis the poet first mentions the rude beginning of tragedy carmen tragicum the goatsong he then speaks of the satyrick chorus soon after interwoven with it and then proceeds to the improvements of these bacchic festivities by thespis and aeschylus though their perfection and final establishment is ascribed by aristotle to sophocles  dacier very properly renders this passage on dit que thespis fut le premier qui inventa une especi de tragedy auparavant inconnue aux grecs thespis is said to be the first inventor of a species of tragedy before unknown to the greeks  boileau seems to have considered this part of the epistle in the same light that i have endeavored to place it  la tragedy inform and grossiere au

parler la loi qui le bannit ce qu horace regard comme une espece de fletrissure properly speaking the law only abolished the abuse of the chorus the ignominy lay in dropping the entire use of it on account of this restraint horace was of opinion that the chorus ought to have been retained though the state had abridged it of the license it so much delighted in of an illimited and intemperate satire sublatus chorus fuit says scaliger cujus illae videntur esse praecipuae parts ut potissimum quos liberet laederent  notes on the art of poetry if dacier be mistaken in this instance his mistake is common to all the commentators not one of whom the learned and ingenious author of the above note excepted has been able to extract from these words any marks of horaces predilection in favor of a chorus or censure of its culpable omission in comedy de nores expresses the general sense of the critics on this passage  turpiter quia lex declarata veteris comoediae scriptorum improbitate eos a maledicendi licentia deterruit  sicuti enim antea summa cum laud vetus comoedia accepta est ita postea summa est cum turpitudine vetantibus etiam legibus repudiata quia probis hominibus quia sapientibus quia integris maledixerit quare comoediae postea conscriptae ad hujusce veteris differentiam sublato choro novae appellatae sunt what horace himself says on a similar occasion of the suppression of the fescennine verses in the epistle to augustus is perhaps the best comment on this passage   quin etiam lex poenaque lata malo quae nollet carmine quenquam describi vertere modum formidine fustis ad been dicendum delectandumque redacti      daring their grecian masters to forsake and for their themes domestic glories take net nimium meruere decus vestigia graeca ausi deserere and celebrare domestica facta the author of the english commentary has a note on this passage replete with fine taste and sound criticism  this judgment of the poet recommending domestic subjects as fittest for the stage may be enforced from many obvious reasons as   that it renders the drama infinitely more affecting and this on many accounts   as a subject taken from our own annals must of course carry with it an air of greater probability at least to the generality of the people than one borrowed from those of any other nation   as we all find a personal interest in the subject   as it of course affords the best and easiest opportunities of catching our minds by frequent references to our manners prejudices and customs and of how great importance this is may be learned from hence that even in the exhibition of foreign characters dramatic writers have found themselves obliged to sacrifice truth and probability to the humor of the people and to dress up their personages contrary to their own better judgment in some degree according to the mode and manners of their respective countries letude egale des poets de differens tems a plaire a leurs spectateurs a encore influe dans

and spirit  ii next which should ever be one great point in view it renders the drama more generally useful in its moral destination for it being conversant about domestic acts the great instruction of the fable more sensibly affects us and the characters exhibited from the part we take in their good or ill qualities will more probably influence our conduct  iii lastly this judgment will deserve the greater regard as the conduct recommended was in fact the practice of our great models the greek writers in whose plays it is observable there is scarcely a single scene which lies out of the confines of greece  but notwithstanding these reasons the practice has in all times been but little followed the romans after some few attempts in this way from whence the poet took the occasion of delivering it as a dramatic precept soon relapsed into their old use as appears from senecas and the titles of other plays written in or after the augustan age succeeding times continued the same attachment to grecian with the addition of an equal fondness for roman subjects the reason in both instances has been ever the same that strong and early prejudice approaching somewhat to adoration in favor of the illustrious names of those two great states the account of this matter is very easy for their writings as they furnish the business of our younger and the amusement of our riper years and more especially make the study of all those who devote themselves to poetry and the stage insensibly infix in us an excessive veneration for all affairs in which they were concerned insomuch that no other subjects or events seem considerable enough or rise in any proportion to our ideas of the dignity of the tragic scene but such as time and long admiration have consecrated in the annals of their story our shakespeare was i think the first that broke through this bondage of classical superstition and he owed this felicity as he did some others to his want of what is called the advantage of a learned education thus uninfluenced by the weight of early prepossession he struck at once into the road of nature and common sense and without designing without knowing it has left us in his historical plays with all their anomalies an exacter resemblance of the athenian stage than is any where to be found in its most professed admirers and copyists  i will only add that for the more successful execution of this rule of celebrating domestic acts much will depend on the era from whence the subject is taken times too remote have almost the same inconveniences and none of the advantages which attend the ages of greece and rome and for those of later date they are too much familiarized to us and have not as yet acquired that venerable cast and air which tragedy demands and age only can give there is no fixing this point with precision in the general that era is the fittest for the poets purpose which though fresh enough in our minds to warm and interest us in the event of the action is yet at so great a distance from the present times as to have lost all those mean and disparaging circumstances which unavoidably adhere to recent deeds and in some measure sink the noblest modern transactions to the level of ordinary life  notes on the art of poetry the author of the essay on the writings and genius of pope elegantly enforces a like opinion and observes that milton left a list of thirtythree subjects for tragedy all taken from the english annals       whether the gown prescribed a style more mean or the inwoven purple raised the scene vel qui praetextas vel qui docuere togatas the gown  toga being the common roman habit signifies comedy and the inwoven purple  praetexta being appropriated to the higher orders refers to tragedy togatae was also used as a general term to denote all plays in which the habits manners and arguments were roman those of which the customs and subjects were grecian like the comedies of terence were called palliatae       but you bright hopes of the pompilian blood never the verse approve etc vos o pompilius sanguis etc the english commentary exhibits a very just and correct analysis of this portion of the epistle but neither here nor in any other part of it observes the earnestness with which the poet on every new topic addresses his discourse to the pisos a practice that has not passed unnoticed by other commentators on this passage de nores writes thus  vos o pompilius sanguis per apostrophen sermonem convertit ad pisones eos admonens ut sibi caveant ab hujusmodi romanorum poetarum errore videtur autem eos ad attentionem excitare dum ait vos o et quae sequuntur      because democritus etc excludit sanos helicone poetas democritus de nores has a comment on this passage but the ambiguity of the latin relative renders it uncertain how far the critic applies particularly to the pisos except by the apostrophe taken notice of in the last note his words are these nisi horum democriticorum

of plato aristotle and cicero showing that the truth of representation  verae voces must be derived from an imitation of general nature not from copying individuals mankind however being a mere collection of individuals it is impossible for the poet not to found his observations on particular objects and his chief skill seems to consist in the happy address with which he is able to generalize his ideas and to sink the likeness of the individual in the resemblance of universal nature a great poet and a great painter have each illustrated this doctrine most happily and with their

communicate a character of grandeur to the whole yet a dash of the latter is sometimes necessary to give an interest an individual model copied with scrupulous exactness makes a mean style like the dutch and the neglect of an actual model and the method of proceeding solely from idea has a tendency to make the painter degenerate into a mannerist  it is necessary to keep the mind in repair to replace and refreshen those impressions of nature which are continually wearing away  a circumstance mentioned in the life of guido is well worth the attention of artists he was asked from whence he borrowed his idea of beauty which is acknowledged superior to that of every other painter he said he would show all the models he used and ordered a common porter to sit before him from whom he drew a beautiful countenance this was intended by guido as an exaggeration of his conduct but his intention was to show that he thought it necessary to have some model of nature before you however you deviate from it and correct it from the idea which you have formed in your mind of perfect beauty  in painting it is far better to have a model even to depart from than to have nothing fixed and certain to determine the idea there is something then to proceed on something to be corrected so that even supposing that no part is taken the model has still been not without use  such habits of

epistle which i must confess i am surprised that any commentator ever past without observing the peculiar language and conduct of the poet there is a kind of awful affection in his manner wonderfully calculated to move our feelings and excite our attention the didactick and the epistolary style were never more happily blended the poet assumes the air of a father advising his son rather than of a teacher instructing his pupils many critics have thrown out a cursory observation or two as it were extorted from them by the pointed expressions of the poet but none of them that i have consulted have attempted to assign any reason why horace having closed his particular precepts addresses all the remainder of his epistle on the nature and expediency of poetical pursuits to the elder piso only i have endeavored to give the most natural reason for this conduct a reason which if i am not deceived renders the whole of the epistle interesting as well as clear and consistent a reason which i am the more inclined to think substantial as it confirms in great measure the system of the author of the english commentary only showing the reflections on the drama in this epistle as well as in the epistle to augustus to be incidental rather than the principal subject and main design of the poet  jason de nores in this instance as in most others has paid more attention to his author than the rest of the commentators his note is as follows  o major juvenum per apostrophen ad majorem natu ex pisonibus convertis orationem reddit rationem quare summum ac perfectissimum poema esse debeat

indirect apology for his own choice of them for   vitae monstrata via est is the character of his sermones and   all the rest of his odes  i must add the very terms of the apology so expressly define and characterize lyrick poetry that it is something strange it should have escaped vulgar notice there is much ingenuity in this interpretation and it is supported with much learning and ability yet i cannot think that horace meant to conclude this fine encomium on the dignity and excellence of the art of poetry by a partial reference to the two particular species of it that had been the objects of his own attention the muse and apollo were the avowed patrons and inspirers of poetry in general whether epick dramatick civil moral or religious all of which are enumerated by horace in the course of his panegyric and referred to in the conclusion of it that piso might not for a moment think himself degraded by his attention to poetry  in hoc epilogo reddit breviter rationem quare utilitates a poetis mortalium vitae allatas recensuerit ne scilicet pisones ex nobilissima calpurniorum familia ortos musarum and artis poeticae quam profitebantur aliqnando poeniteret  de nores haec inquit eo recensui ut quam olim res arduas poetica tractaverit cognoscas and ne musas contemnas atque in poetarum referri numerum erubescas  nannius ne forte pudori haec dixi o piso ne te pudeat poetam esse  schrevelius   0  whether good verse of nature is the fruit or raised by art has long been is dispute in writing precepts for poetry to young persons this question could not be forgotten horace therefore to prevent the pisos from falling into a fatal error by too much confidence in their genius asserts most decidedly that nature and art must both conspire to form a poet dacier  the duke of buckingham has taken up this subject very happily  number and rhyme and that harmonious sound which never does the ear with harshness wound are necessary yet but vulgar arts for all in vain these superficial parts contribute to the structure of the whole without a genius too for that is the soul a spirit which inspires the work throughout as that of nature moves the world about as all is dullness where the fancys bad so without judgment fancy is but mad and judgment has a boundless influence not only in the choice of words or sense but on the world on manners and on men fancy is but the feather of the pen reason is that substantial useful part which gains the head while the other wins the heart essay on poetry      as the sly hawker etc various commentators concur in marking the personal application of this passage  faithful friends are necessary to apprise a poet of his errors but such friends are rare and difficult to be distinguished by rich and powerful poets like the pisos  dacier pisonem admonet ut minime hoc genus divitum poetarum imitetur neminemque vel jam pransum out donatum ad suorum carminum emendationem admittat neque enim poterit ille non vehementer laudare etiamsi vituperanda videantur  de nores in what sense roscommon the translator of this epistle understood this passage the following lines from another of his works will testify  i pity from my soul unhappy men compelled by want to prostitute their pen who must like lawyers either starve or plead and follow right or wrong where guineas lead but you pompilian wealthy pampered heirs who to your country owe your swords and cares let no vain hope your easy mind seduce for rich ill poets are without excuse it is very dangerous tampring with a muse the profits small and you have much to lose for though true wit adorns your birth or place degenerate lines degrade the attainted race essay on translated verse   0  but if he keeps a table etc  si vero est unctum etc  here says dacier the poet pays en passant a very natural and delicate compliment to the pisos the drift of the poet is evident but i cannot discover the compliment       is there a man to whom you have given ought or mean to give tu seu donaris etc here the poet advises the elder piso never to read his verses to a man to whom he has made a promise or a present a venal friend cannot be a good critic he will not speak his mind freely to his patron but like a corrupt judge betray truth and justice for the sake of interest  dacier   0  kings have been said to ply repeated bowls etc reges dicuntur etc regum exemplo

virgil and horace of whom the latter lamented his death in a pathetick and beautiful ode still extant in his works quintilius appears to have been some time dead at the time of our poets writing this epistle dacier  quintilius descriptis adulatorum moribus and consuetudine affert optimi and sapientissimi judicis exemplum quintilii scilicet qui tantae erat authoritatis apud romanos ut ei virgilii

colors in his draught of a true critic  but where is the man who counsel can bestow still pleased to teach and yet not proud to know unbiased or by favor or by spite not dully prepossessed nor blindly right tholearnd wellbred and though wellbred sincere modestly bold and humanly severe who to a friend his faults can freely show and gladly praise the merit of a foe blessed with a taste exact yet unconfined a knowledge both of books and human kind generous converse a soul exempt from pride and love to praise with reason on his side essay on criticism      while with his head erect he threats the skies horace says dacier diverts himself with describing the folly of a poet whom his flatterers have driven mad to whom the caution against flatterers was addressed has before been observed by dacier this description therefore growing immediately out of that caution must be considered as addressed to the elder piso   0   leaped coldly into aetnas burning mount ardentem frigidus aetnam insiluit this is but a cold conceit not much in the usual manner of horace       whether the victim of incestuous love the blasted monument he strived to move an triste bidental moverit incestus the bidental was a place that had been struck with lightning and afterward expiated by the erection of an altar and the sacrifice of sheep hostiis bidentibus from which it took its name the removal or disturbance of this sacred monument was deemed sacrilege and the attempt a supposed judgment from heaven as a punishment for some heavy crime    0  hangs on him never to quit with ceaseless speech till gorged and full of blood a very leech the english commentary introduces the explication of the last hundred and eleven lines of this epistle the lines which i think determine the scope and intention of the whole in the following manner  having made all the reasonable allowances which a writer could expect he horace goes on to enforce the general instruction of this part viz a diligence in writing by showing from l     to     that a mediocrity however tolerable or even commendable it might be in other arts would never be allowed in this  this reflection leads him with great advantage from l     to     to the general conclusion in view viz that as none but excellent poetry will be allowed it should be a warning to writers how they engage in it without abilities or publish without severe and frequent correction  if the learned critic here means that  the general instruction of this part viz a diligence in writing is chiefly inculcated for the sake of the general conclusion in view a warning to writers how they engage in poetry without abilities or publish without severe and frequent correction if i say a dissuasive from unadvised attempts and precipitate publication is conceived to be the main purpose and design of the poet we perfectly agree concerning this last and important portion of the epistle with this addition however on my part that such a dissuasive is not merely general but immediately and personally directed and applied to the elder piso and that too in the strongest terms that words can afford and with a kind of affectionate earnestness particularly expressive of the poets desire to awaken and arrest his young friends attention  i have endeavored after the example of the learned and ingenious author of the english commentary though on somewhat different principles to prove an unity of design in this epistle as well as to illustrate the pertinent connection of its several parts many perhaps like myself will hesitate to embrace the system of that acute critic and as many or more may reject my hypothesis but i am thoroughly persuaded that no person who has considered this work of horace with due attention and carefully examined the drift and intention of the writer but will at least be convinced of the folly or blindness or haste and carelessness of those critics however distinguished who have pronounced it to be a crude unconnected immethodical and inartificial composition no modern i believe ever more intently studied or more clearly understood the works of horace than boileau his art of poetry is deservedly admired but i am surprised that it has never been observed that the plan of that work is formed on the model of this epistle though some of the parts are more in detail and others varied according to the age and country of the writer the first canto like the first section of the epistle to the pisos is taken up in general precepts the second enlarges on the lyrick and elegiack and smaller species of poetry but cursorily mentioned or referred to by horace but introduced by him into that part of the epistle that runs exactly parallel with the second canto of boileaus art of poetry the third canto treats entirely on the ground of horace of epick and dramatick poetry though the french writer has with great address accommodated to his purpose what horace has said but collaterally and as it were incidentally of the epick the last canto is formed on the final section the last hundred and eleven lines of the epistle to the pisos the author however judiciously omitting in a professed art of poetry the description of the frantic bard and concluding his work like the epistle to augustus with a compliment to the sovereign  this imitation i have not pointed out in order to depreciate the excellent work of boileau but to show that in the judgment of so great a writer the method of horace was not so ill conceived as scaliger pretends even for the outline of an art of poetry boileau himself at the very conclusion of his last canto seems to avow and glory in the charge of having founded his work on that of horace  pour moi qui jusqici nourri dans la satire nose encor manier la trompette and la lyre vous me verrez pourtant dans ce champ glorieux vous animez du moins de la voix and des yeux vous offrir ces lecons que ma muse au parnasse rapporta jeune encor du commerce dhorace boileau after endeavoring to vouch so strong a testimony in favor of horaces unity and order from france it is but candid to acknowledge that two of the most popular poets of our own country were of a contrary opinion dryden in his dedication of his translation of the aeneid to lord mulgrave author of the essay on poetry writes thus in this address to your lordship i design not a treatise of heroic poetry but write in a loose epistolary way somewhat tending to that subject after the example of horace in his first epistle of the  d book to augustus caesar and of that to the pisos which we call his art of poetry in both of which he observes no method that i can trace whatever scaliger the father or heinsius may have seen or rather think they had seen i have taken up laid down and resumed as often as i pleased the same subject and this loose proceeding i shall use through all this prefatory dedication yet all this while i have been sailing with some side wind or other toward the point i proposed in the beginning the latter part of the comparison if the comparison is meant to hold throughout as well as the words  somewhat tending to that subject seem to qualify the rest as if dryden only meant to distinguish the loose epistolary way from the formality of a treatise however this may be had he seen the chart framed by the author of the english commentary or that now delineated perhaps he might have allowed that horace not only made toward his point with some sidewind or other but proceeded by an easy navigation and tolerably plain sailing  many passages of this dedication as well as other pieces of drydens prose have been versified by pope his opinion also on the epistle to the pisos is said to have agreed with that of dryden though the introduction to his imitation of the epistle to augustus forbids us to suppose he entertained the like sentiments of that work with his great predecessor his general idea of horace stands recorded in a most admirable didactick poem in the course of which he seems to have kept a steady eye on this work of our author  horace still charms with graceful negligence and without method talks us into sense will like a friend familiarly convey the truest notions in the easiest way he who supreme in judgment as in wit might boldly censure as he boldly writ yet judged with coolness though he sung with fire his precepts teach but what his works inspire our critics take a contrary extreme they judge with fury but they write with phlegm nor suffers horace more in wrong translations by wits than critics in as wrong quotations essay on criticism i have now completed my observations on this popular work of horace of which i at first attempted the version and illustration as a matter of amusement but which i confess i have felt in the progress to be an arduous undertaking and a laborious task such parts of the epistle as corresponded with the general ideas of modern poetry and the modern drama i flattered myself with the hopes of rendering tolerable to the english reader but when i arrived at those passages wholly relative to the ancient stage i began to feel my friends dropping off and leaving me a very thin audience my part too grew less agreeable as it grew more difficult i was almost confounded in the seriocomick scenes of the satyrick piece in the musical department i was ready with le fevre to execrate the flute and all the commentators on it and when i found myself reduced to scan the merits and demerits of spondees and trimeters i almost fancied myself under the dominion of some plagosus orbilius and translating the prosodia of the latin grammar borrowers and imitators cull the sweets and suck the classick flowers rejecting at pleasure all that appear sour bitter or unpalatable each of them travels at his ease in the high turnpikeroad of poetry quoting the authority of horace himself to keep clear of difficulties  et quae desperate tractata nitescere posse relinquit   a translator must stick close to his author follow him up hill and down dale over hedge and ditch tearing his way after his leader through the thorns and brambles of literature sometimes lost and often benighted  a master i have and i am his man galloping dreary dun the reader i fear will fancy i rejoice too much at having broke loose from my bondage and that i grow wanton with the idea of having regained my liberty i shall therefore engage an advocate to recommend me to his candor and indulgence and as i introduced these notes with some lines from a noble poet of our own country i shall conclude them with an extract from a french critic or if i may speak the language of my trade as i opened these annotations with a prologue from roscommon i shall drop the curtain with an epilogue from dacier another curtain now demands my attention i am called from the contemplation of ancient genius to sacrifice with due respect to modern taste i am summoned from a review of the magnificent spectacles of greece and rome to the rehearsal of a farce at the little theater in the haymarket  voila tout ce que jai cru necessaire pour lintelligence de la poetique dhorace si jule scaliger lavoit bien entendue il lui auroit rendu plus de justice and en auroit parle plus modestement mais il ne sestoit pas done la temps de le bien comprendre ce livre estoit trop petit pour estre

wants not less than mine nor her agony less at hazard suppose an unfortunate cast has swept her last guinea nay more than her last her diamonds all mortgaged her equipage sold her husband undone genteel friends looking cold at her feet his sweet person lord foppington throws the most handsome of nobles the richest of beaux at once too his love and his bounty dispenses sooths with thousands

reverses rise and we are betrayed by turns their neighbor province to invade husbands the distaff take wives seize the club at home their patient hercules to drub while sir appears so feminine and trim and madam looks so masculine and grim you scarce know him from her or her from him in changes thus if humbler ranks should strive maid servants soon will mount the box and drive or else to reason and decorum blind seizing a place unfit for womankind with flambeaux in their hands jump up behind while footmen women grown as now grown fops shall darn old hose sweep rooms and trundle mops ladies and gentlemen it is yours tonight to end disputes and set the sexes right to check the inroads of the tyrant man and keep within due bounds the womans plan let me then as a female envoy greet ye and here negociate a commercial treaty forbid the men by some restraining clause to deal in ribbands muslin blond and gause bid women too resign the barbers trade and cease to shave the guards on the parade equal to male and female show compassion assert what is right and laugh it into fashion epilogue to the tragedy of julia or the italian lover intended for miss farren april      at the side scene may i come in  the prompter bids me enter  and yet i vow i am half afraid to venture advancing  be your eyes wet yes faith  nay truce with sorrow julias quite well and dies again tomorrow tomorow did i say tomorrows sunday so if you please she will die again on monday i have heard the tragedy with strict attention  the tale they say is fact and no invention and while deep critics ponder on its merits i will tell you how it acted on my spirits as by the scenes i took my silent stand each act that past i hailed this happy land bards who from history or fiction glean rarely in england place the tragic scene led by the muse they sail over distant seas scale alps on alps or pierce the pyrenees abroad in search of cruelties they roam follies and frailties may be found at home passions in warmer climes that fiercely burn here lose their rancour and to humors turn not cankring inwards with a treacherous stealth break nobly out and keep the soul in health no lovers here contending for a wife mix poisonous bowls or draw the murdrers knife no julia here should find her virgin fame arraigned for crimes she shudders but to name safe from such horrors in a generous nation where madness only dreams assassination no though the moonlight walk and precious picture conspire with jealous fulvia to convict her tried fairly tried in our high court of drury she will stand acquitted by an english jury wise was the man who each returning morn thanked his kind stars he was in england born and wiser still the fair that lot possessing who proves she knows the value of the blessing with pity who beholds poor julias fate yet prizes as she ought her happier state the charms of english worth who can discover and never wish for an italian lover i did not know that the pen of malice or slander had ascribed the suppression of this epilogue at the theater to the pretended indelicacy of its contents till i had seen the generous vindication of it by another hand the epilogue was written at the particular instance of a very worthy friend of mr jephson by whom and by the author it was received with cordial thanks and the warmest approbation mrs siddons however seeming to expect the epilogue her importance to the piece rendered the friends of the author unwilling to question her claim and a few alterations were made in the introductory lines which the change of the supposed speaker required  supposed for mrs siddons after keeping the epilogue some days returned it with a declaration that she would not speak it and a request of another the alterations with an additional couplet occurred between the  th and   th lines and are here subjoined with the variations printed in italicks  you have heard the tragedy with due attention  the tale they say is fact and no invention how ill our bard has touched it or how well many sage critics will precisely tell let me then while they ponder on its merits say how it moved a patriot females spirits while crimes like these on foreign records stand how warmly must we hail this happy land prologues at wynnstay prologue to the beggars bush spoken at wynnstay christmas      the muse that charms the polished city

humble petition through england south wales and north wales i have traveled many years since and represented lover and hero wit and fool statesman and cuckold beggar and prince nay more than roscius betterton booth or garrick himself could say i have acted every part  women as well as men  every part in every play not long ago at oswestry we did the falchion wield now near this place we pitch our tent  very near here  even in wrexham field by metaphor i say field for in fact at a very great expense we have fitted up the town hall and for the first time made it the theater of common sense our bills all honestly paid now new dangers we essay rival strollers have arisen and are resolved to exhibit at wynnstay and what i am sure in our cause will make you very hearty the little manager from the haymarket is one of the party they call themselves gentlemen indeed but still i say so much the worse for when gentlemen act unlike gentlemen it is a private and a public curse why should a gentleman pretend to more than he understands take the bread out of our mouths and our trade out of our hands all arts are best executed by the artists themselves gentlemen artists are mostly mere dabblers and ignorant elves says sir john his round hat on his head a quid in his mouth and long whip in his hand i will drive you my dear at the door see the horses and phaeton stand from high steps to the chaise sir john and the lady mount three pair of stairs while the mob in the street at the cavalcade stares chuck chuck  off they go  jehu oight oight till at some sudden pitch sir john and the lady come souse in a ditch such are baronet drivers and thus country squires hunt a pack or ride matches thus generals write plays and thus nobles sing catches thus tonight a welsh baronet and his friends give a play and promise dramaticks for the whole week to come at wynnstay with rule a wife and have a wife the entertainments of the season they mean to make you sick and turn shakespeares great richard the entertainments of the season to tiny king dick of bonton the entertainments of the season they will give you much more than you desire and when they promise entertainment no doubt they will play the liar the entertainments of the season  but after all ladies and gentlemen peace is our plan and we wish to compromise this matter if we can they have given some reasons which i think will hold water  they have had a christening it seems and sir watkin has got another daughter besides the former worthy mistress of this place now deigns with her presence their gambols to grace
