information to parents respecting the vaccine inoculation or the inoculation for cowpox  by f skrimshire m d  wisbech printed and sold by john white  price sixpence    00  advertisement the practice of inoculating for the vaccine disease has not yet extended to this town and neighborhood i have therefore drawn up this statement as calculated in my opinion to render its introduction less liable to objection and its adoption more general  were this example to be followed by some respectable medical man before its introduction into other parts of the country there would probably be less of that opposition which every innovation meets with be its advantages ever so apparent and which for a long time baffled the exertions of the first inoculators for the smallpox  wisbech july      00  information etc there is a disorder often prevailing among cows known to the farmers and peasants of several parts of this country by the name of cowpox and to those of ireland by the name of shinagh it appears on the nipples of milch cows in the form of irregular pustules of a bluish or livid hue with inflamed bases which afterward become troublesome ulcers the persons employed in milking these cows are frequently attacked with similar pustules on their hands appearing at first like small blisters produced by a burn and then degenerating into sores in those parts of the kingdom where there are large dairies and where consequently this disease more frequently occurs it has for a long time been a prevailing opinion that persons who are accidentally affected with the cowpox previously to having the small pox are no longer subject to the latter and that if inoculated with smallpox matter or ever so much exposed to the infection they will not take that disease this curious opinion attracted the attention of dr jenner to the subject and induced him to make further enquiries concerning its authenticity in      he published his first dissertation containing a description of the disease and a collection of cases tending to prove the fact that cowpox or as it is now called the vaccine disease destroys all susceptibility to the smallpox in consequence of which he strongly recommended the vaccine inoculation instead of inoculation for the smallpox since that period much has been done not only by dr jenner but by various other medical men toward establishing the preference for this kind of inoculation and the practice has now to boast of as its advocates some of the greatest ornaments to the medical profession  being myself fully persuaded of the advantages of the vaccine inoculation i wish to extend the knowledge of the discovery and to dispense the benefits of it to the inhabitants of this neighborhood with this view i am induced to draw up a correct statement of the advantages that are proposed by it and the progress that it has already made so that every parent may be enabled to judge for himself whether he ought or ought not to prefer this kind of inoculation for his children  the chief advantages arise from its being a much milder disease than the inoculated smallpox and from its not being contagious  the operation is performed in the same manner as for the smallpox by inserting the matter under the scarf skin and to avoid unnecessary pain from the sores it should be performed only on one arm on the third or fourth day the part appears inflamed and elevated in a few days more a pustule is evident on the incised spot and sometimes one or more vescicles appear about its edge and in a fortnight more or less the parts scab over and become well in many cases not the least general indisposition is apparent in others the patients complain of sickness headache or other uneasines for a few hours on the fourth fifth or in many cases not till the ninth or tenth day according as the affection of the arm proceeds such is the usual progress of the disease which in general is so mild as to require no confinement and if any medicine at all only a dose of opening physic some practitioners have met with several cases where an eruption very like to if not the same with that of smallpox has come out at the time of sickening but this it now appears has generally arisen from their using matter not altogether pure but taken from persons laboring under both or a mixture of the two diseases and from this source a spurious matter has been disseminated in various parts of the country this at least is commonly supposed to be the true cause of those variolouslike eruptions and dr jenner having been particularly careful to use only genuine vaccine matter has never met with a single case of them dr woodville who met with most of these eruptive cases soon made this important observation that by using only the matter taken from patients having no eruption such an occurrence became less and less frequent and dr pearson in his last statement gives their proportion as not more than one out of every two hundred cases observing at the same time that the disease is then as mild as the inoculated smallpox it is the opinion of many that by carefully avoiding every source of smallpox contagion you may also avoid these cases of eruption there is another kind of pimples and rash that has appeared upon persons inoculated for the vaccine disease which is not of the smallest consequence disappearing in a day or two and is probably not at all connected with the disease to prove that there is considerably less hazard in inoculating for this disease than for smallpox allow me to inform you that upon an average one case out of every four or five hundred of inoculated smallpox terminates fatally you are aware too that in some families it is almost always a very formidable disease in some seasons too it is much more severe than in others and very often it is impossible by any treatment to prevent inoculated patients from being marked now more than six thousand persons have been inoculated for the vaccine disease and only one has died nor is it fair to state that this child died of this disease for it was one of those who had an eruption very like to that of smallpox and concerning which there is much reason to doubt whether there was not also smallpox infection in some cases the sore in the arm has proved troublesome and been a good deal inflamed but never dangerous and a plan of treatment is now adopted to prevent even that the disease seems to have been equally mild in all families and constitutions and by it all pockmarks are effectually prevented in short its superior mildness alone would insure its preference but there are other advantages to be derived from the inoculation for it which if it becomes general are incalculable the vaccine disease is not like the smallpox contagious it cannot be communicated but by inoculation accidental or artificial so that one part of the family may be inoculated and another run no risk of taking the disease for the same reason you need never delay inoculation till the disease is in the neighborhood as is often the case in country towns and villages in short you may always choose both time and place consulting only the health of the child and your own convenience  moreover if the practice becomes general or even tolerably so the small pox will become a rare disease or may be even altogether exterminated which considering its present ravages must be to the man of humane feelings a most desirable object it is a point generally allowed among medical men that the introduction of inoculation for smallpox has not by any means diminished its fatality but that even more persons have died of it annually since than before that period the reason is obvious previous to inoculation the smallpox appeared only now and then and was in nearly a similar situation with the plague whereas it is now a constant disease in every large town and very frequently appears in the country the contagion being kept constantly afloat by inoculation the disease taken in the natural way is still very formidable and as inoculation is by no means generally adopted thousands are every year carried by it to their graves how much then ought we to rejoice at being offered the means of exterminating so dreadful a scourge and how ready should we be to commence and forward so benevolent a plan  there is one more advantage which even in this early stage of the practice seems to be generally admitted the smallpox in certain constitutions has been often observed to excite the latent seeds of other disorders and has in many cases been the cause of them we frequently meet with persons afflicted with scorbutic eruptions as they are commonly termed with the kings evil and sometimes with sits who date the origin of their complaints from the time of their having had the smallpox and there is reason to believe that it does frequently excite these disorders in persons that are predisposed to them and it is certain that many diseases of the eye and sometimes deafness have been produced by the confluent smallpox now it is asserted by those who have had most experience in the vaccine disease that no such consequences have been observed from it but that in some cases it has wrought beneficial changes in unhealthy and unthriving children  to ensure the object of the present statement i trust i have now nothing more to do than to advert to the mass of evidence that has been brought to prove the sufficiency of the practice to destroy all susceptibility in the persons inoculated to receive the smallpox i have said before that in many parts of the kingdom it is a prevailing opinion that the cowpox prevents a person taking the smallpox dr jenner published upwards of twenty well marked cases where persons who accidentally took the cowpox fifteen twenty and some thirty years ago have never had the smallpox though inoculated for it and in various other ways exposed to the infection dr pearson has since published other cases to the same point and many are related in the medical periodical publications of the day almost every surgeon has in the course of inoculation for the smallpox met with instances of his patients not taking the disease in various cases of this kind that have occurred lately the surgeons on further enquiry have ascertained that such persons have been previously affected with the cowpox in opposition to all this evidence not one unexceptionable case has been found to prove a persons having the smallpox after the cowpox the only one that seems to have the least weight is that published by dr beddoes in his west country contributions and again and again in various periodical publications a gentleman at bristol says he had the smallpox very severely some years after having the cowpox but considering that no reference is made to the medical gentleman who attended him and that even medical men cannot always distinguish between one eruption and another we may without derogating from the discriminating powers of the bristol attorney suppose him for once to have mistaken some other disease for the cowpox at any rate a single case can by no means invalidate all the evidence we possess against it to the above proof we have now to add those derived from experiments instituted for the purpose out of the six thousand persons inoculated in different parts of the country for the vaccine disease more than onehalf have been since inoculated for the smallpox and in no individual case has the later disease been induced what more authority can be wanted to prove the sufficiency and utility of the practice we have the avowed concurrence of some of the most respectable medical characters in the kingdom and the tacit concurrence of all for who that knew but a single valid objection would not give it to the world all those parents then who have been advocates for inoculating for the smallpox must now by a parity of reasoning be advocates for the vaccine disease for why did they inoculate to substitute a mild for a dangerous disease but here is a disease still safer than the inoculated smallpox and equally certain of preventing those inoculated for it ever after taking the natural smallpox you have therefore the same inducements now to prefer the vaccine inoculation that you had to adopt inoculation in the first instance  the rapid progress that the practice has made which is another argument in favor of its utility will appear from what follows dr jenner the original proposer of the plan has inoculated several hundreds dr woodville physician to the smallpox hospital has inoculated above two thousand and dr pearson by his indefatigable exertion has inoculated and received communications containing the results of as many more thomas klate esquire surgeon general to the army has introduced the practice into his department and dr trotter physician to his majestys fleet has i have reason to believe before this time introduced it into his the practice in short is so well approved of by all the faculty as to be daily becoming more general both here and abroad and an establishment has been for two months past effected in london called the cowpock institution for the sole purpose of inoculating this disease the patron is his royal highness the duke of york and the vice presidents right honorable lord petre sir george baker bart william devaynes esquire m p sir william lee bart h j de salis d d f r s william adam esquire m p   i have said that the discovery of dr jenner has afforded us the means of very greatly diminishing if not of entirely putting a stop to the havoc of the smallpox this is only to be done by making the practice general and it is therefore necessary to introduce it into the mansions of the poor it has been usual for the overseers of parishes to contract with surgeons for the inoculation of all the poor willing to undergo the operation it is for them now to consider whether it would not prove a much more beneficial object to make the same contract for inoculating with vaccine matter another plan for extending the practice would be to establish an infirmary or dispensary for the purpose of inoculating and giving the proper advice and medicine to the poor which might be supported at a very trifling expense and that would no doubt be cheerfully defrayed by voluntary subscription i leave it for others to determine which of the two plans it would be preferable to adopt but hope it will not be long before one or the other is set on foot as the object it embraces is no less than the substituting a mild and manageable disease for one that often defies the whole art of medicine and of thus preserving annually the lives of thousands of our fellow creatures  finis white printer wisbech
