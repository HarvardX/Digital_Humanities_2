in    0 the compilers of the biograpica britannica were led into this mistake by a wood the life of archbishop abbot george abbot was born october   th      at guildford in surrey of very worthy parents remarkably distinguished by their steady zeal for the protestant religion for their living long and happily together and for their singular felicity in their children mr maurice abbot was by trade a clothworker and settled at the town of guildford in surrey where he married his wife alice march and suffered for his stedfastness in the protestant religion through the means of dr story who was a great persecutor of such persons in the reign of queen mary but these storms being blown over they passed the remainder of their days quietly living together fiftyeight years she deceased september      0  and he september    the same year the former being eighty and the latter eightysix years of age they left behind them six sons of whom robert the eldest was then one of the kings chaplains george had been thrice vice chancellor of oxford and their youngest son maurice was at this time an eminent merchant of the city of london   while his mother was pregnant with this son she is said to have had a dream which proved at once an omen and an instrument of his future fortunes her dream was this she fancied she was told in her sleep that if she could eat a jack or pike the child she went with would prove a son and rise to great preferment not long after this in taking a pail of water out of the river wey which ran by their house she accidentally caught a jack and had thus an odd opportunity of fulfilling her dream this story being much talked of and coming to the ears of some persons of distinction they offered to become sponsors for the child which was kindly accepted and they had the goodness to afford many testimonies of their affection to their godson while at school and after he was sent to the university such was the good effects of his mothers dream  when he was grown up to an age proper for receiving the first tincture of learning he was sent with his elder brother robert to the free school erected in their native town of guildford by k edward vi and having passed through the rudiments of literature under the care of mr francis tailor who had then the direction of that school he was in      removed to the university of oxford and entered a student in baliol college on november the   th      being then bachelor of arts he was elected probationer fellow of his college and afterward proceeding in the faculty of arts he entered into holy orders and became a celebrated preacher in the university he commenced bachelor of divinity in      and proceeded doctor in that faculty in may      and in the month of september of the same year he was elected master of university college about this time it was that the first differences began between him and dr laud which subsisted as long as they lived and was the cause of great uneasiness to both on march        he was installed dean of winchester in the room of dr martin heton who was preferred to the bishopric of ely dr abbot being then about thirtyseven years of age  in   00 he was vice chancellor of the university of oxford and distinguished himself while in that high office by the opinion he gave with respect to the setting up again the cross in cheapside about which there were great disputes but in the end he carried his point against dr bancroft then bishop of london and afterward archbishop of canterbury which gained him great reputation as appears by a tract published on that subject the cross at cheapside was taken down in the year   00 in order to be repaired and upon this occasion the citizens of london desired the advice of both universities on this question whether the said cross should be reerected or not and dr abbot as vice chancellor of oxford gave it as his opinion that the crucifix with the dove upon it should not be again set up but approved rather of a pyramid or some other matter of mere ornament for the reasons assigned in his letter in this determination he acted consistently with his own practice when in his said office he caused several superstitious pictures to be burnt at the marketplace of oxford and among the rest one in which was the figure of god the father over a crucifix ready to receive the soul of christ and he professes in this letter that he was moved to such proceedings by his own observation and experience i remember says he in that college baliol where i first lived a young man was taken praying and beating his breast before a crucifix in a window which caused the master and fellows to pull it down and set up other glass which example makes me nothing doubt but that the cross in cheapside has many in the twilight and morning early who do reverence before it besides campian whose act is famous or rather infamous for it and i am informed that so much has been signified by the neighbors or inquest making presentiments concerning the circumstances of this cause by all which i do conclude that it is a monument of their superstition a great inducement and may be a ready way to idolatry and that there can be no tolerable use of this matter which may be able to countervail the dangers and obloquy arising upon the retaining of it and so much the rather because it is perceived that many evil affected men do make their advantage from hence to insinuate into the minds of their credulous hearers that it is a token of the return of their faith again into this land since their monuments are not extinguished in the chief street of our greatest city   he afterward desires that the reader would observe he says the magistrates are to redress such enormities for continues he i do not permit inferior men to run headlong about such matters and to rend break and tear as well within as without the churches which was that which luther reprehended but the advice and consent of superior powers is to be had herein that all things may be done decently and in order   he held it therefore necessary that they should apply to the archbishop of canterbury whitgift and to the bishop of london bancroft for instructions the issue of the matter was that the cross only was erected again without either the body or the dove which was agreeable in the main to the sentiments of the vice chancellor and the heads of houses at oxford     in   0  he was again chosen vice chancellor of the university and discharged that office a second time with general approbation in   0  he was a third time vice chancellor in the succeeding year he is said to have had a great share in the troubles of laud who was called to an account by the vice chancellor dr ayry for a sermon of his preached before the university and that year likewise he lost his father and mother  in   0  died his great patron thomas sackville earl of dorset lord high treasurer of england and chancellor of the university of oxford suddenly at the council table at whose funeral dr abbot preached a sermon which was afterward printed and generally commended after his decease dr abbot became chaplain to george hume earl of dunbar and treasurer of scotland one of king jamess early favorites and who had all along had a very high share in his esteem and with him he went this year into scotland in order to assist in the execution of a very important design for establishing an union between the churches in that kingdom and this wherein he behaved with so much prudence and moderation as gained him a very high character and is thought to be the first step to all his future preferments there is no point in which all the writers who mention this prelate more clearly agree than in this that his journey to scotland brought him into that height of favor with the king which so suddenly raised him in little more than three years from dean of winchester to archbishop of canterbury yet it has so fallen out that hitherto his transactions in scotland have lain so much in the dark that it is a very difficult thing to discern how he merited by them so high a share of the royal favor to explain therefore this hitherto untouched point and set this matter in a clear light shall be the business of this note the rather because it will show how unjustly this great man has been charged with unfriendliness to the establishment of the church of england and coldness in regard to the hierarchy king james had suffered so much before his accession to the crown of england from the spirit and power of the presbyterians in scotland that he was greatly set on restoring the ancient form of government by bishops in that kingdom the care of which was principally entrusted to the earl of dunbar to whom dr abbot was now chaplain that noble lord who is by all writers allowed to have been both the wisest and best man of all the favorites of that nation had proceeded so far in this matter two years before as to obtain an act for the restitution of the estates of bishops but the presbyterians made so steady a resistance that the consequences which were hoped from the restoring of that order were in the utmost danger of being disappointed but by the skill and prudence the sound sense and great moderation of dr abbot these difficuties were removed and the clergy of scotland who had refued to admit the bishops for their moderators in their church synods were brought to a better temper and things put into such a train as afterward produced the entire establishment of the episcopal order in scotland for which the king had been so long struggling and to so little purpose the account given by the famous historian of the church of scotland david calderwood sufficiently proves the truth of what has been asserted about the end of june   0  says he the earl of dunbar came from court and with him two english doctors abbot and higgins dr maxy one of the kings chaplains came by sea it was reported that no small sums of money were sent down with him to be distributed among the ministers and some others the english doctor seemed to have no other direction but to persuade the scots that there was no substantial difference in religion between the two realms but only in things indifferent concerning government and ceremonies and to report that it was his majestys will that england should stand as he found it and scotland as he lft it but when he came to st andrews mr robert howie a man of a seditious and turbulent spirit declaimed against the discipline and government of our kirk and then they uttered their mind in plain terms no order was taken with so manifest a breach after the last conference this was the policy of the aspiring bishops to cry peace peace and to crave silence of their opposites when in the mean time they minded not to be silent themselves when they found occasion this very clearly proves that it was by a kind and moderate not a haughty and severe behavior that the english doctor as he calls dean abbot won so much upon the scots ministers as to bring them into a compliance with the kings desires so that in two years afterward the lord high treasurer dunbar who was entirely governed in this matter by the advice of his able chaplain procured an act in the general assembly by which it was provided that the king should have the indiction or calling of all general assemblies that the bishops or their deputies should be perpetual moderators of the diocesan synods that no excommunication or absolution should be pronounced without their approbation that all presentations of benefices should be made by them and that the deprivation or suspension of ministers should belong to them that every minister at his admission to a benefice should take the oath of supremacy and canonical obedience that the visitation of the diocese shall be performed by the bishop or his deputy only and finally that the bishop should be moderator of all conventions for exercisings or prophesyings which should be held within their bounds all which were afterward ratified and confirmed by authority of the parliament of that kingdom such were the merits of dr abbot in this respect and so great justice was there done to them by his noble patron the treasurer in the report he made to his majesty of the deans behavior in this respect that in conjunction with the service rendered his majesty by giving his unquestioned testimony in the affair of gowrys conspiracy of which a full account shall be given in the succeeding note he was raised so high and so firmly fixed in the esteem of his royal master as that no opposition could prevent his arriving at the supreme dignity in his profession as a proof of his advancing his fortune by this means and not otherwise it may not be amiss to transcribe the observation of a contemporary historian speed after dr abbot was raised to the archiepiscopal dignity who tells us that the first preacher and the first in that embassage which king james sent into scotland to establish those neighboring churches was he whose eminency both for place and piety is now worthily foremost in guiding our own and whose blessed travels in that service as they were acceptable to god his majesty and that nation so are they a document to others how powerful and admirably successful true learning is where it is guided with true prudence and where piety and the love of gods glory is linked with charity and zeal of mans good     while he was at edinburgh upon this occasion a prosecution was commenced against one george sprot notary of aymouth for having been concerned in gowrys conspiracy eight years before for which he was tried before sir william heart lord justice general of scotland condemned and executed a large account of this affair was drawn up by the judge and a narrative prefixed thereto by dr abbot who had been eyewitness of all that passed and this was published at london in order to settle the minds of the people with regard to that conspiracy which had hitherto been looked upon as a very mysterious affair and about the reality of which there had been very great doubts there had been very great doubts it is a difficult thing to give a clear account of this matter within the short compass of a note and yet the importance as well as curiosity of the subject very obscurely treated by most of our historians as well as its close connection with the history of dean abbots life render it absolutely necessary the conspiracy was framed by john earl of gowry son to that earl of gowry who had been executed for surprising the kings person at ruthen castle in      and carried on with great diligence and seerecy the scheme was to invite the king upon some pretense or other to the earls house at perth and there to make sure of him this design was executed on tuesday august     00 when the king was brought thither by mr alexander ruthen brother to the earl accompanied by some persons of quality under pretense of seeing some chemical experiment and for this purpose after dinner being brought to a chamber at the top of the house mr alexander ruthen shut the door and suddenly fell to upbraiding the king with the death of his father for which he was now to make satisfaction and after this speech left him for some time to the mercy of the executioner who refused to do that office though alexander returning had if this man had not hindered him but the king with much struggling got at last to a window and cried out so loud that the lords and gentlemen of his retinue heard him and came to his assistance the earl himself was killed by sir thomas ereskine the captain of the kings guard as he was going to help his brother and alexander ruthen was dispatched by ramsay one of the kings pages who being well acquainted with the house came by the backstairs time enough to preserve his master when the ministers of edinburgh were desired to assemble the people and give god thanks for this deliverance they excused themselves as not acquainted with the particulars and when they were pressed only to make known to the people that the king had escaped a great danger and to excite them to thanksgiving  they answered that they were not very well satisfied as to the truth of the matter and that nothing was to be uttered in the pulpit but that which might be spoke in faith upon this the council ordered the bishop of ross to assemble the people to declare the whole affair and to make a prayer of thanksgiving which was done accordingly in november following a parliament was held at edinburgh in which the estate of gowry was confiscated the whole family attainted and the  th of august established by act of parliament for a day of thanksgiving in all succeeding times after king jamess accession to the throne of england he appointed a weekly commemoration by a tuesdays sermon at court and now on the execution of this sprot an account of his share in the conspiracy was published with a preface to the reader subscribed by dr abbot and full as large as the account itself as this little tract is become very scarce it may not be amiss to give some passages from it in order to set this matter in a clearer light there are few in this island says he of any understanding but have heard of the traitorous and bloody attempt of the earl gowrie and his brother against the person and life of our most blessed sovereign wherein albeit there were such evidences and arguments as that any man who would have taken notice thereof might have been sufficiently informed therein even at the very first and afterward by the clear depositions for most pregnant circumstances and ample attestations of many persons of honor and quality the parliament of that kingdom took full knowledge thereof and accordingly proceeded to the forfeiting of the whole estate of that earl and of his heirs for ever yet some humorous men whom in that respect i may justly term unthankful unto god and undutiful to their king out of fond imaginations or rather if you will seditious suppositions of their own did both at home and abroad by whisperings and secret buzzings into the ears of the people who were better persuaded of them than indeed there was cause employ their wits and tongues to obscure the truth of that matter and to cast an imputation where it was least deserved which when god had permitted for the space of some years to ranckle and fester in the bowels of those who were the authors of it the same god in his wisdom at last meaning to cure them if they would be cured of that malady discovered that in the same treason although carried never so secretly there were other confederates of whom hitherto the world had taken no kind of knowledge and albeit two of the persons interested in that business were lately dead and departed unto far greater torment than all the earth could lay upon them unless they died repentant yet it was apprehended that a third party remained who had foreknowledge of that conspiracy and was able to utter much of the secrets of it one george sprot a notary inhabiting at ayemouth a place well known in that county which matter or some part thereof being made known to an honorable person the earl of dunbar a most faithful servant to his majesty first by some words that fell from sprot himself and afterward by some papers found upon him it was so wisely carried and so prudently brought about by the great care and diligence of that nobleman god almighty blessing the business that so much was revealed as follows in this treatise upon the acts to be seen which are here set down at large word for word as they agree with the process original and other examinations that such as have been averse may at last receive satisfaction touching all which i shall say nothing but only report that which befell upon the day of his death when he suffered for that treason having then the sentence passed on him upon friday august      0  in the forenoon and publicly being warned to prepare himself to his end which must be that day after dinner he most willingly submitted himself unto that punishment which as he then acknowledged he had justly deserved and being left to himself till dinner time was expired then came to him into that private place where he remained some of the reverend bishops diverse lords of the session two of the english ministers there employed by his majesty with diverse other ministers of the town of edinburgh before whom he first acknowledged and avouched his former confession to be true and that he would die in the same and then falling on his knees in a corner of that room where he and they then were in a prayer to god uttered aloud he so passionately deplored his former wickednesses but especially that sin of his for which he was to die that a man may justly say he did in a sort deject and cast down himself to the gates of hell as if he should there have been swallowed up in the gulf of desperation yet presently laying hold upon the mercies of god in christ he raied himself and strangely lifted up his soul unto the throne of grace applying joy and comfort to his own heart so effectually as cannot well be described in the comting of this coafolation into his inward man he burst out into tears so plentifully flowing from him that for a time they stopped his voice the sight and hearing whereof wrought so forcible an impression in those persons of honor and learned men who beheld him that there was scarce any one of them who could refrain tears in the place as diverse of themselves that day did witness unto me  afterward being brought to the scaffold where he was to die he uttered many things among which i observed these he acknowledged to the people that he was come thither to suffer most deservedly that he had been an offender against almighty god in very many respects but that none of his sins were so grievous unto him as that for which he must die where in notwithstanding he was not an actor but a concealer only that he was ingyred involved in it by the lord of rastalrig and his servant the lord of bour both which he said were men that professed not religion whereupon he exhorted men to take heed how they accompanied with such as are not religious because said he with such as make not profession of religion there is no faith no truth no holding of their word as himself had tried and found but touching the treason for the concealing whereof he was condemned he added that he was preserved alive to open that secret mystery which so long had lain hid that god had kept him since that attempt of the earl gowrie from very many dangers but notedly from one when being in apparent hazard of drowning he was strangely delivered which said he was gods work that i might remain alive unto this happy and blessed day that the truth might be made known and now i confess my fault to the shame of myself and to the shame of the devil but to the glory of god and i do it not either for fear of death or for any hope of life for i have deserved to die and am unworthy to live but because it is the truth which i shall seal with my blood my fault says he is so great that if i had a thousand lives and could die ten thousand deaths yet i might not make satisfaction that i should conceal such a treason against so gracious a king these and the like words when he had spoken upon one side of the scaffold he turned him to the second side and afterward to the third that all the people might hear where he spoke to the same purpose as formerly he had done  and here being told by the said ministers and other persons of quality that being so near his departure out of the world it concerned him to speak nothing but the truth and that upon the peril of his soul he answered that to the end that they should know that he had spoken nothing but the verity and that his confession was true in every respect he would at the last gasp give them some apparent token for the confirmation of the same then fitting himself to the ladder the executioner comes to him and as the manner is asking forgiveness of him with all my heart says he for you do but your office and it is the thing i desire because suffering in my body i shall in my soul be joined to my savior ascending up to the ladder he desired the people to sing a psalm with him which they did with many a weeping eye he named the  th psalm and beginning or taking it up himself in every verse or line thereof he went before the people singing both loud and tunably unto the very end then once again confirming and avowing his former confession he covered his own face and commending his soul to god he was turned off the ladder where hanging by the neck some little while he three several times gave a loud clap with his hands that all the standersby might hear which was the sign or token as it seems which he a little before had said that he would give at the last gasp for the rati ication and avowing of those things which by his confession he had so many times declared and delivered these things were done in the open sight of the sun in the kings capital town at the marketcross in edinburgh in the presence os diverse thousands of all sorts of the nobility of the clergy of the gentry of the burgesses of women and children myself with the rest of the english ministers standing by and looking on and giving god the glory that after so long a space as eight years and eight days for so it was by just computation after the attempt of gowrie he was pleased to give so noble a testimony unto that which by some maligners has been secretly called in question without any ground or reason i have reported at length those particulars which i heard and saw which that honorable personage who wrote this treatise following does somewhat more bricy deliver but yet both of us very truly as thousands can witness     the king knew so well the difficulties that were to be encountered in this northern nation that it gave him very high ideas of the abilities of the man who was able to overcome them and therefore when another set of men filled the kings head and heart with apprehensions he had recourse to dr abbot as the fittest person to put things again into the right channel the case was this his majesty being engaged in the mediation of peace between the crown of spain and the united provinces by which the sovereignty of the latter was to be acknowledged by the former he demanded the advice of the convocation then sitting as to the lawfulness of espousing the cause of the states upon this opening they launched at once into the wide sea of politics and instead of satisfying the kings scruples excited new jealousies and apprehensions as appears by a very singular letter written by him to dr abbot upon this subject a very singular letter written by him to dr abbot upon this subject this letter from the king to dr abbot was first published on occasion of the famous dispute between dr sherlock dean of st pauls and his adversaries on his taking the oaths to king william iii after some hesitation and grounding the defense of his conduct on bishop overalls convocation book it is not necessary here to enter at all into the merits of that dispute but as the letter has a close connection with the history of the archbishops life the reader will not be displeased to see it good dr abbot i cannot abstain to give you my judgment of the proceedings in the convocation as you will call it and both as rex in solio and unus gregis in ecclesia i am doubly concerned my title to the crown nobody calls in question but they that neither love you nor me and you may guess whom i mean all that you and your brethren have said of a king in possession for that word i tell you is no more than that you make use of in your canon concerns not me at all i am the next heir and the crown is mine by all rights you can name but that of conquest and mr solicitor has sufficiently expressed my own thoughts concerning the nature of kingship and concerning the nature of it ut in mea persona and i believe you were all of his opinion at least none of you said any thing contrary to it at the time he spoke to you from me but you know all of you as i think that my reason of calling you together was to give your judgments how far a christian and a protestent king may concur to affist his neighbors to shake off their obedience to their own sovereign upon the account of oppression tyranny or what else you like to name it in the late queens time this kingdom was very free in assisting the hollanders both with arms and advice and none of your coat ever told me that any scrupled at it in her reign upon my coming to england you may know that it came from some of yourselves to raise scruples about this matter and albeit i have often told my mind concerning jus regium insubditos as in may last in the star chamber upon the occasion of haless pamphlet yet i never took any notice of these scruples till the affairs of spain and holland forced me to it all my neighbors call on me to concur in the treaty between holland and spain and the honor of the nation will not suffer the hollanders to be abandoned especially after so much money and men spent in their quarrel therefore i was of the mind to call my clergy together to satisfy not so much me as the world about us of the justness of my owning the hollanders at this time this i needed not to have done and you have sorced me to say i wish i had not you have dipped too deep in what all kings reserve among the arcana imperii and whatever aversion you may profess against gods being the author of sin you have stumbled upon the threshold of that opinion in saying upon the matter that even tyranny is gods authority and should be remembered as such if the king of spain should return to claim his old pontifical right to my kingdom you leave me to seek for others to fight for it for you tell us upon the matter beforehand his authority is gods authority if he prevail  mr doctor i have no time to express my mind further on this theory business i shall give you my orders about it by mr solicitor and until then meddle no more in it for they are edge tools or rather like that weapon that is said to cut with one edge and cure with the other i commit you to gods protection good dr abbot and rest  your good friend james r        it does not appear what effect this letter of the kings produced but in all probability it answered his majestys end in writing it as it is an incontestable proof of the confidence he had in the person it was written to at least thus much is certain that dean abbot stood so high in the kings favor that on the death of dr overton bishop of litchfield and coventry which happened the latter end of april   0  his majesty thought of dr abbot for his successor and he was accordingly consecrated bishop of those united sees on december   in the same year  but this it seems did not appear in the kings eyes a sufficient recompense for the services rendered him by so able a man and therefore before he had set a month in this bishopric he was translated to london that see becoming void by the death of dr thomas ravis and he was accordingly removed thither on the  0th of january following it was but a short time that he possessed both these bishoprics and yet in that short time he so remarkably distinguished himself by the diligent performance of his function by constant preaching and by expressing the utmost readiness to promote learning and learned men that he obtained a general good character as appears from several memorials of those times as appears from several memorials of those times while he was bishop of coventry and litchfield it appears that he solicited abp bancroft to bestow a prebend upon dr thomas james who was sir thomas bodleys librarian at oxford in the year    0 thomas tisdale of glimpton in oxfordshire esquire bequeathed five thousand pounds to dr george abbot then bishop of london sir john bennet and dr array to purchase lands for the maintenance of seven fellows and six scholars which money was laid out in the purchase of two hundred and fifty pounds a year afterward richard wightwick b d rector of eastisle in berkshire gave lands to the yearly value of one hundred pounds for the maintenance of three fellows and four scholars upon which the trustees beforementioned having repaired and in a manner rebuilt broadgatehall in oxford procured in the reign of king james upon their petition setting forth these facts a charter of mortmain for seven hundred pounds per annum to this new foundation which was called pembroke college in respect to william earl of pembroke then chancellor of the university and for our prelates activity in accomplishing this affair dr thomas clayton who was the first master of the new college wrote him a very handsome letter of acknowledgement which is still extant see wards lives of the professors of gresham college fol    0 p   0 in august    0 he consecrated the new churchyard on the west side of fleetditch the around of which had been given to the inhabitants of st brides parish by the earl of dorset his zeal and indefatigable diligence in the public exercise of his function were so remarkable and the conduct of his private life so exemplary as well as irreproachable that we find him celebrated by an eminent poet j davis of hereford in his scourge of folly etc in honor of many noble and worthy persons for uniting the wisdom of the serpent with the innocence of the dove which was not only true of him then but in the whole succeeding course of his life wherein it may be truly said that as his abilities raised him to preferment so nothing but his rigid virtue and incorruptible probity exposed him to those storms of envy and malice which however they might affect his fortune could never shake his constancy or prejudice his reputation   while the good bishop was thus employed a new opportunity offered of the kings testifying his esteem of and confidence in this worthy person by the archiepiscopal see of canterburys becoming vacant as it did on the  d of november    0 by the death of dr richard bancroft  the court bishops immmediately cast their eyes upon the celebrated dr lancelot andrews then bishop of ely and pointed him out to the king as one sufficiently qualified to take upon him the government of the church and they thought this recommendation joined to the kings known regard for the parts and piety of this eminent man enough to secure his promotion to the primacy but either the king himself thought of the bishop of london or he was proposed to him by his old friend and patron the earl of dunbar and therefore without taking the advice of those prelates his majesty preferred bishop abbot to the throne of canterbury in which he was seated on the  th of april      and on the   d of june following was sworn of his majestys most honorable privy council  thus we see him before he had arrived at the age of fifty exalted to the highest dignity of the church and celebrated by one of his contemporaries and a bishop too godwin for his learning eloquence and indefatigable diligence in preaching and writing notwithstanding the great burden that lay upon him from the necessary attendance on the duties of his high office especially presiding in the high commission court which sat weekly at his palace and his regular assisting at council which while his health permitted he never failed  at this time he was in the highest favor both with prince and people and appears to have had a principal hand in all the great transactions in church and state he was never esteemed excessively fond of power or desirous of carrying his prerogative as primate of england to an extraordinary height yet as soon as he had taken possession of the archbishopric he showed a steady resolution in the maintenance of the rights of the high commission court and would not submit to lord cokes prohibitions  he likewise showed his concern for the interest of the protestant religion abroad by procuring his majestys application to the states general against conrade vorstius whom they called to the professorship of leyden in which affair sir ralph winwood was employed and when it was found difficult to obtain from the states that satisfaction which the king desired his grace in conjunction with the lord treasurer salisbury framed an expedient for contenting both parties  in all probability this alarmed some of the warm churchmen at home who were by no means pleased with the kings discountenancing abroad those opinions which themselves favored in both universities but whatever their sentiments upon this matter might be archbishop abbot seems to have had as great concern for the church as any of them when he thought it really in danger as appears by a short and plain letter of his to sir ralph winwood about one mr amias who had been appointed preacher in the english congregation at the hague of whom the bishop says that he was a fit person to breed up the captains and soldiers there in mutiny and faction and consequently very unfit for his office  his great concern for the true interest of religion made him a zealous promoter of the match between the elector palatine and the princess elizabeth and that prince being here in the beginning of the year      his grace thought fit to invite the nobility that attended him to an entertainment at his archiepiscopal palace at lambeth where though uninvited and unexpected the elector himself resorted to show his great respect for the archbishop and was so well pleased with his welcome that when he feasted the members of the privy council at essex house he showed particular respect to the archbishop and thse who attended him  on the fourteenth of february following the marriage was solemnized with great splendour the archbishop performing the ceremony on a stage erected in the middle of the royal chapel and on the tenth of april his electoral highness returned to germany but before his departure he made a present of plate to the archbishop of the value of a thousand pounds as a mark of the just sense he had of the pains his grace had taken in the accomplishing his marriage and as an additional mark of his confidence he wrote to him from canterbury in relation to the causes of that discontent with which he left england to the causes of that discontent with which he left england the prince elector palatine a little before he left england addressed himself to the king in hopes of obtaining the enlargement of the lord gray who had been a long time a prisoner in the tower but this application so little pleased the king that he told him roundly in answer he marvelled how he should become a suitor for a man whom he neither knew or ever saw to which the prince elector answered that this was true but that he was recommended to him by his uncles the duke de bouillon prince maurice of nassau and count henry who were well acquainted with him in all probability this instead of giving the king satisfaction filled him with new apprehensions for his reply was in a very quick style son said he when i come into germany i promise you not to importune you for any of your prisoners this was so far from operating favorably in behalf of lord gray that he was soon after more closely restrained upon pretense of some private conversation he had with one of lady arabellas women which proved after all to be no more than an amorous intrigue these particulars we learn from a letter written by mr chamberlain to sir ralph winwood dated may        and he adds it is thought the prince palatine went not away so well satisfied being refused in diverse suits and requests and i hear that from canterbury he wrote to the archbishop complaining that the king did not use him like a son but rather like a youngling or childish youth not to he regarded        the concern his majesty had shown for removing arminius first and then vorstius had given their favorers in holland so much uneasiness that the famous hugo grotius the great champion of their cause was sent over to england to endeavor to mitigate the kings displeasure and if possible to give him a better opinion of the remonstrants as they began then to be called and we have a very singular account of the man and of his negotiation from the pen of the archbishop of the man and of his negotiation from the pen of the archbishop this is contained in a letter from his grace to sir r winwood dated june        from lambeth it contains a great variety of curious particulars some of which follow you must take heed how you trust dr grotius too far for i perceive him to be so addicted to some partialities in those parts that he seareth not to lash so it may serve a turn at his first coming to the king by reason of his good latin tongue he was so tedious and full of tittletattle that the kings judgment was of him that he was some pedant full of words and of no great judgment and i myself discovering that to be his habit as if he did imagine that every man was bound to hear him so long as he would talk which is a great burden to men replete with business did privately give him notice thereof that he should plainly and directly deliver his mind or else he would make the king weary of him this did not so take place but that afterward he fell to it again as was especially observed one night at supper at the lord bishop of elys whither being brought by mr casabon as i think my lord entreated him to stay to supper which he did there was present dr steward and another civilian unto whom he flings out some question of that profession and was so full of words that dr steward afterward told my lord that he did perceive by him that like a smatterer he had studied some two or three questions whereof when he came in company he must be talking to vindicate his skill but if he were put from those he would show himself but a simple fellow there was present also dr richardson the kings professor of divinity in cambridge and another doctor in that faculty with whom he falls in also about some of those questions which are now controverted among the ministers in holland and being matters wherein he was studied he uttered all his skill concerning them my lord of ely sitting still at the supper all the while and wondering what a man he had there who never being in the place or company before could overwhelm them so with talk for so long a time i write this unto you so largely that you may know the disposition of the man and how kindly he used my lord of ely for his good entertainment  you will ask me what is this to you i must tell you therefore that you shall not be without your part at the same time that sir noel caron was together with grotius being now to take his leave of the king it was desired of his majesty that he would not hastily give his judgment concerning points of religion now in difference in holland for that his majesty had information but of one side and that his ambassador did deal partially making all reports in favor of the one side and saying nothing at all for the other for he might have let his majesty know how factious a generation these contradicters are how they are like to our puritans in england how refractory they are to the authority of the civil magistrate and other things of like nature as i wrote you in my former letter i doubt not but grotius had his part in this information whereout i conceive you will make some use keeping these things privately to yourself as becomes a man of your employment when his majesty told me this i gave such an answer as was sit and now upon the receipt of your letters shall upon the first occasion give further satisfaction all things rest there as they did and i as ready to do you all good offices remain etc  george cant        in the spring of the year      the affair of the charterhouse was settled and at the close of the month of june his grace and the rest of the trustees took possession of that place pursuant to the will of mr sutton and if this gave the archbishop as no doubt it did great satisfaction an affair that happened about the same time disturbed him not a little  this was the famous case of divorce between the lady frances howard daughter to the earl of suffolk and robert earl of essex her husband which has been always considered as one of the greatest blemishes of king jamess reign though the part acted therein by the archbishop of canterbury added much to the reputation he had already acquired for unshaken and incorruptible integrity unshaken and incorruptible integrity this affair of the divorce was by the king referred to a court of delegates consisting of his grace the archbishop of canterbury the bishops of london winchester coventry and litchfield and rochester sir julius caesar sir thomas parrey sir daniel dunn dr john bennet dr francis james and dr thomas edwards this affair was drawn out into a great length and many accidents happened in the course of it which gave the archbishop infinite disquiet he saw plainly that the king was very desirous the lady should be divorced and on the other hand he was in his judgment directly against the divorce he labored all he could to extricate himself from these difficulties by having an end put to the cause some other way than by sentence but it was to no purpose for those who drove on this affair had got too great power to be restrained from bringing it to the conclusion they desired the archbishop was told that a predecessor of his which was archbishop grindall had suffered about dr julios divorce and so might he but this however did not at all move him on the contrary he prepared a speech against the nullity of the marriage which he intended to have spoken in the court at lambeth september         but he did not make use of that speech because the king ordered them to deliver their opinions in few words he continued however inflexible with regard to his opinion and therefore when sentence was pronounced the court was divided in the following manner  the commissioners who gave sentence in the lady essexs behalf were bishops winchester ely litchfield and coventry rochester doctors of law sir julius caesar sir thomas parrey sir daniel dunn    the commissioners dissenting archbishop of canterbury bishop of london doctors of law sir john bennet francis james thomas edwards    to justify his conduct in this matter the archbishop drew up the reasons which induced him to be against the sentence which king james thought fit to answer himself and wrote also a letter to him upon that subject in which there are some things that are very singular and therefore worthy the readers notice after that i had fully perused and rightly considered of all your papers i found your principles so strange and your doubts so far sought that i thought it necessary as i have already said to set down unto you my observations upon them but to conclude my letter with that plainness that becomes one of my quality i must freely confess that i find the grounds of your opposition so weak as i have reason to apprehend that the prejudice you have of the persons is the greatest motive of breeding these doubts into you which prejudice is the most dangerous thing that can fall in a judge for misleading of his mind and the reason moving me to this apprehension is partly grounded upon your last words to me at your parting from windsor and partly upon a line scraped out in your paper of doubts for i am sure you think me not so blunt a secretary but that i can read a line so scraped out in your last speeches with me you remember you told me what assurance you had of the earls ability out of his own mouth which you said you could not but trust because he was so religious a nobleman but when i told you of the other partys contrary affirmation you remember how you used the word of iniquity and how far your interlined line seems to have a harmony with this word yourself can best judge now then if i would ask you what proof you have of the ones religion more than the others you must answer me by judging upon the exterior and how deceivable that guess is daily experience teaches us but with a holy protestation that i never knew any thing but good in the young earl was not this the ground of master robert bruses incredulity because he knew the earl of gowry to be truly religious etc   this letter might and probably did trouble the archbishop however he persisted in the same conduct and never could be brought to do any thing that might appear so much as a tacit approbation of that sentence as is most evident in the account given of this matter and all the circumstances attending it at least in relation to the archbishop written by himself see a further account of this treatise in the list of the archbishops writings     the circumstances that attended this affair might possibly leffen the kings favor to him in some respects but he still retained a great share of it as appears by the raising his brother to the sea of salisbury in the year      but with queen anne he stood always on the best terms possible as we learn from himself in a passage of a work of his transcribed in the following note  he made use of his interest with her majesty when all other applications had failed to engage her to recommend mr george villiers so well known afterward in the world to his majestys favor for which at that time the young man was so grateful as to call him father and to desire his advice as to his behavior which the archbishop very freely gave him and it had been very happy for him if he had always followed those councils if he had always followed those councils we have this very remarkable passage from the archbishops own pen in the discourse he wrote upon his disgrace under the reign of king charles in that discourse he observes that it was one of king jamess maxims to take no favorite but what was recommended to him by his queen that if she afterward complained of this dear one he might answer it is long of yourself for you were the party that commended him unto me our old master says the archbishop took delight strangely in things of this nature he says that queen anne was graciously pleased to give him more credit than ordinary and therefore when others had solicited her in vain he was applied to but for some time her majesty would not listen to his persuasions or think of recommending villiers for which she often gave him those reasons my lord you and the rest of your friends know not what you do i know your master better than you all for if this young man be once brought in the first persons that he will plague must be you that labor for him yea i shall have my part alfo the king will teach him to despise and hardly entreat us all that he may seem to be beholden to none but himself noble queen cries out the archbishop after reporting this fact how like a prophetess did you speak the rest of the story being but short will appear best in the archbishops own words in the end says he upon importunity queen anne condescended and so pressed it with the king that he assented thereunto which was so stricken while the roh was hot that in the queens bedchamber the king knighted him with the rapier which the prince did wear and when the king gave order to swear him of the bedchamber somerset who was near importuned the king with a message that he might only be sworn a groom  but myself and others that were at the door sent to her majesty that she would perfect her work and cause him to be sworn a gentleman of the chamber there is a lord or two living that had a hand in this achievement i diminish nothing of their praise for so happy a work but i know my own part best and on the word of an honest man i have reported nothing but truth george went in with the king but no sooner he got loose but he came forth unto me in the privygallery and there embraced me he professed that he was so infinitely bound unto me that all his life long he must honor me as his father and now he did beseech me that i would give some lessons how he should carry himself when he earnestly followed this chase i told him i would give him three short lessons if he would learn them the first was that daily upon his knees he should pray to god to bless the king his master and to give him george grace studiously to serve and please him the second was that he should do all good offices between the king and the queen and between the king and the prince the third was that he should fill his masters ears with nothing but truth i made him repeat these three things unto me and then i would have him to acquaint the king with them and to tell me when i met him again what the king said unto him he promised me he would and the morrow after mr thomas murrey the princes tutor and i standing together in the gallery at whitehall sir george villiers coming forth and drawing to us he told mr murrey how much he was beholden unto me and that i had given him certain instructions which i prayed him to rehearse as indifferently well he did before us yea and that he had acquainted the king with them who said they were instructions worthy of an archbishop to give to a young man his countenance of thankfulness for a few days continued but not long either to me or any other of his wellwishers the roman historian tacitus has somewhere a note that benefits while they may be requited seem courtesies but when they are so high that they cannot be repaid they prove matters of hatted     toward the close of the next year the famous antonio de dominis archbishop of spalato took shelter here from the persecution with which he was threatened by the pope for discovering his dislike both of the doctrine and discipline of the church of rome and was very kindly received by his majesty who was pleased to order the archbishop to entertain him which he did with generous hospitality till he was otherways provided for by the king his grace however thought himself sufficiently recompensed for the trouble given him in this affair by this strangers procuring for him the manuscript of father pauls excellent history of the council of trent  in the spring of the year      viz on the second of march our good archbishop lost his brother the bishop of salisbury and before his grief was well over for so near a relation he met with fresh disturbances from the kings declaration for permitting sports and pastimes on the lords day which was dated at greenwich may         the kings declaration for permitting sports and pastimes the declaration runs thus that for his good peoples lawful recreations his pleasure was that after the end of divine service they should not be disturbed let or discouraged from any lawful recreations such as dancing either men or women archery for men leaping vaulting or any other such harmless recreations nor from having of maygames whitsunales or morricedances and setting up of maypoles or other sports therewith used so as the same be had in due and convenient time without impediment or let of divine service and that women should have leave to carry rushes to the church for the decoring of it according to their old custom withal prohibiting all unlawful games to be used on the sundays only as bearbaiting bullbaiting enterludes and at all times in the meaner sort of people by law prohibited bowling     this declaration was ordered to be read in churches and the archbishop being accidentally at croydon in surrey when it came thither had the courage to forbid it is being read which however the king winked at notwithstanding there were some about him who let no opportunity slip of irritating him against this prelate  the council of dort set this year to which were sent from hence in the beginning of the month of october four commissioners and amongst them dr hall dean of winchester with whose health the climate of holland disagreeing he returned and dr goad the archbishops chaplain was sent in his place  the end of this year proved as disagreable to the archbishop as it is beginning in autumn the queen his gracious mistress falling ill of that distemper which after a tedious sickness brought her to her end on the first of march following  the archbishop himself began also to grow infirm and finding himself less fit for the affairs of the world than he had been resolved while he had still strength to enter upon a great and good design which he had long meditated as a testimony of affection to his native town of guildford where on the fifth of april      he laid the first stone of his hospital and afterward nobly endowed it a particular account of which will be given  it was toward the end of this year that the elector palatine accepted of the crown of bohemia  occasioned great disputes in king jamess  some desiring that his majesty should not  in this matter at all from a foresight that t would produce a war in germany others again believing that both natural affection to his son and daughter and a just concern for the protestant interest ought to have engaged his majesty warmly to support the new election the archbishop agreed  ntiment with the last mentioned party and not being able at that time to attend the privy council he wrote his mind with great plainness and freedom the secretary of state he wrote his mind with great plainness and freedom to the secretary of state this letter shall be here transcribed not so much in proof of the matter of fact asserted in the text as in respect to the work itself for so it may be styled though no more than a letter since it contains a compendious system of the archbishops sentiments in religion and politics so that if we were to spend ever so much in the enquiry after these points we should never be able to point them out so clearly fully and in a manner so much to the readers satisfaction as they are here and in another letter hereafter cited represented by the archbishops own pen to secretary naunton good mr secretary i have never more desired to be present at any consultation than that which is this day to be handled for my heart and all my heart goes with it but my foot is worse than it was on friday so that by advice of my physician i have sweat this whole night past and am directed to keep my bed this day  but for the matter my humble advice is that there is no going back but a countenancing of it against all the world yea so far as with ringing of bells and making of bonsires in london so soon as it shall be certainly understood that the coronation is past i am satisfied in my conscience that the cause is just wherefore they have rejected that proud and bloody man and so much the rather because he has taken a course to make that kingdom not elective but to take it from the donation of another man and when god has set up the prince that is chosen to be a mark of honor through all christendom to propagate his gospel and to protect the oppressed i dare not for my part give advice but to follow where god leads  it is a great honor to the king our master that he has such a son whose virtues have made him thought fit to be made a king and methinks i do in this and that of hungary foresee the works of god that by piece and piece the kings of the earth that gave their power unto the beast all the word of god must be fulfilled shall now tear the whore and make her desolate as st john in his reveltion has sretold i pray you therefore with all the spirits you have to put life into this business and let a return be made into germany with speed and with comfort and let it be really prosecuted that it may appear to the world that we are awake when god in this sort calls us  if i had time to express it i could be very angry at the shuffling which was used toward my lord doncaster and the slighting of his embassage so which cannot but touch upon our great master who did send him and therefore i would never have a noble son forsaken for respect of them who truly aim at nothing but their own purposes  our triking in will comfort the bohemians will honor the plgave will strengthen the union will bring on the states of the low countries will stir up the king of denmark and move his own uncles the prince of orange and the duke d bouvl together with treville a rich prince in france to cat in their shares and hungary as i hope being in that same cause will run the same fortune for the means to support the war i hope providebit deus the parliament is the old and honorable way but how assured at this time i know not yet i will hope the best certainly if countenance be given to the action many brave spirits will voluntarily go our great master in sufficient want of money gave some aid to the duke of savy and furnished out a pretty army in the cause of cleve we must try once again what can be done in this business of a higher nature and all the money that may be spared is to be turned that way and perhaps god provided the jewels that were laid up in the tower to be gathered by the mother for the preservation of her daughter who like a noble princess has professed to her husband not to leave herself one jewel rather than not to maintain so religious and righteous a cause you see that lying on my bd i have gone too far but if i were with you this should be my language which i pray you humbly and heartily rereent to the king my master telling him that when i can nd i hope o do his majesty some service herein so commending me unto  i remain  your very loving friend george capt sept               the next year was in a great measure spent in debates and negotiations upon this subject in which the king took a great deal of pains with little effect  the archbishops declining state of health making exercise a thing not only convenient but necessary for him he was wont in the summer to make a tour into hampshire for the sake of recreation and being invited by the lord zouch to hunt in his park at bramzil upon the edge of berkshire and not far from hartford bridge his grace met there with the greatest misfortune that befell him in the whole course of his life for hunting in this park on the twentyfourth of july he let fly a barbed arrow from a crossbow at one of the deer which unfortunately struck one peter hawkins my lord zouchs keeper who was quite out of the bishops sight and had been warned more than once to keep out of the way in the left arm by which wound a large bloodvessel being pierced he bled to death in an hours time this unforeseen accident threw the archbishop into a deep melancholy though he was not conscious to himself of the least inadvertency or indiscretion neither did this wear off in time but throughout his whole life he observed a monthly fast on a tuesday the day on which this fatal mischance fell out and settled an annuity of twenty pounds on the widow which soon procured her another husband  this affair made a very great noise and there wanted not some to represent it in a sinister light to king james but his majesty gave his judgment of matter in a short and clear sentence an angel said he might have miscarried in this sort when he was afterward informed of the legal penalties which his grace had incurred by this accident he wrote him a consolatory letter with his own hand in which amongst other things he told him that he would not add affliction to his sorrow or take one farthing from his chattels or movables which were forfeited by law  the archbishop immediately on this misfortune retired to his own hospital at guildford there to wait the decision of the great point as to the irregularity which some imagined he had incurred for it happened very unluckily that at this juncture there were four bishops elected but not consecrated viz dr john williams lord keeper of the great seal to the sea of lincoln dr john davenant to that of salisbury dr valentine carry to that of exeter and his old antagonist dr william laud whose preferment on this occasion he had warmly opposed to that of st davids and all except dr davenant scrupled the archbishops capacity to lay hands on them till he was cleared from all imputation as to this fact the king being informed of this directed in the beginning of october following a commission to the ten following persons viz the lord keeper the bishops of london winchester and rochester the elects of exeter and st davids sir henry hobart lord chief justice of the common pleas sir john dodderidge one of the justices of the kings bench sir henry martin dean of the arches and dr steward to consider and resolve the three following questions   whether the archbishop was irregular by the fact of involuntary bomicide the bishop of winchester the two judges and the two civilians were very clear that he was not irregular the other five thought he he was   whether that act might tend to scandal in a churchman the bishop of winchester the lord chief justice hobart and dr steward doubted all the rest agreed that a scandal might be taken though not given   how his grace should be restored in case the king should follow the decision of those commissioners who had found him irregular all agreed that it could not be otherwise done than by restitution from the king but they varied in the manner the bishop of winchester the lord chief justice and dr steward thought it should be done by the king and by him alone in the same patent with the pardon the lord keeper and the bishops of london rochester exeter and st davids were for a commission from the king directed to some bishops judge dodderidge and sir henry martin were desirous it should be done both ways for abundant caution this return was made to his majesty on the tenth of november      and accordingly a pardon and a dispensation both bearing date at westminster the twentysecond of november passed the great seal by which his majesty assoiled the archbishop from all irregularity scandal or infamation if any was incurred and declared him capable of all metropolitical authority as if this accident had never happened such was the close of this business after a great variety of proceedings and many arguments published on both sides and many arguments published on both sides as the case was absolutely new and such a one as naturally afforded room for talkative and busy men to display their abilities there was nothing surprising in the noise this accident made or the various constructions put upon it by different people according as their notions or their prejudices led them the archbishop being sensible of all this either wrote himself which is most probable or caused to be written a very short piece under this title an apology for archbishop abbot touching the death of peter hawkins the keeper wounded in the park at bramzil july         by an unknown hand it was sent on the eighth of october      to sir henry spelman who on t e nineteenth of the same month returned an answer to it which discovers full as much severity as learning it is not  ar to whom this apology was addressed or for whose  the answer to it was written but it is very proba that both were intended for the use of the commissioners pointed by the king to enquire into the supposed irregularity of the archbishop of which his grace had notice on the  of october and the commissioners applied themselves ery closely to their business from that time both these  are extant in the posthumous works of sir henry spel but these do not seem to have been the only pieces that we peed on this occasion for we are told by a reverend prelte  hacket that the fact was much discoursed of in foreign  especially amongst our neighbors the sorbonnists who disputed it three several times in their schools and concluded the accident to have amounted to a full irregularity which is an incapacity to exercise any ecclesiastical act of  or      yet all this could not satisfy the minds of those who had scrupled the power of laying on hands and therefore they petitioned the king that they might not be compelled to wound their consciences by submitting to such a consecration and in compliance with their desire the bishop of lincoln was consecrated in king henry viis chapel on the eleventh of november by the bishops of london worcester ely oxford and llandaff and the bishops of sarum exeter and st davids in the chapel of the bishop of londons palace on the eighteenth of november by the same reverend prelates  it does not appear that his grace was at all lessened by the suggestions of his enemies in the kings favor or his courage in any degree abated by the troubles he had met with  in any degree abated by the troubles he had met with bishop hacket in his life of archbishop williams p    says the archbishop was wont to dissent from the king as often as any at the council board and that his majesty loved him the better for his courage and sincerity  on the contrary we find him in the year      opposing the spanish match which was a thing the king had set his heart upon with the greatest firmness and spirit and even venturing under his hand to give his sentiments on that subject in terms so vigorous and pathetick that no pen can properly represent them but his own no pen can properly represent them but his own this letter from the archbishop to king james is without date but the subject points out plainly enough the time when it was written and it is inserted here to show the archbishops principles in religion in regard to which there cannot be a fuller testimony may it please your majesty i have been too long silent and am afraid by my silence i have neglected the duty of the place it has pleased god to call me unto and your majesty to place me in but now i humbly crave leave i may discharge my conscience toward god and my duty to your majesty and therefore i beseech you freely to give me leave to deliver myself and then let your majesty do with me what you please your majesty has propounded a toleration of religion i beseech you to take into your consideration what your act is what the consequence may be by your act you labor to set up the most damnable and heretical doctrine of the church of rome the whore of babylon how hateful it will be to god and grievous to your good subjects the professors of the gospel that your majesty who has often disputed and learnedly written against those heresies should now show yourself a patron of those wicked doctrines which your pen has told the world and your conscience tells yourself are superstitious idolatrous and detestable and hereunto i add what you have done in sending the prince into spain without consent of your council the privity and approbation of your people and although you have a charge and interest in the prince as son of your flesh yet have the people a greater as son of this kingdom upon whom next after your majesty are their eyes fixed and welfare depends and so tenderly is his going apprehended as believe it however his return may be safe yet the drawers of him into this action so dangerous to himself so desperate to the kingdom will not pass away unquestioned unpunished besides this toleration which you endeavor to set up by your proclamation cannot be done without a parliament unless your majesty will let your subjects see that you will take unto yourself ability to throw down the laws of your land at your pleasure what dreadful consequences these things may draw afterward i beseech your majesty to consider and above all lest by this toleration and discountenancing of the true profession of the gospel wherewith god has blessed us and this kingdom has so long slourished under it your majesty do not draw upon this kingdom in general and yourself in particular gods heavy wrath and indignation  thus in discharge of my duty toward god to your majusty and the place of my calling i have taken humble leave to deliver my conscience now sir do what you please with me   rushworths collections vol   page      this letter is likewise printed by arthur willson in his history with this relection both on the king and the archbishop thus did our solomon in his latter time though he had fought with beasts at ephesus as one says of him incline a little too much to the beast yet he made his tale so good to the archbishop of canterbury what reservations soever he had that he wrought upon the good old man afterward in conclusion of the work to set his hand as a witness to the articles upon this another historian of the same reign snderson takes upon him to insinuate that this long letter to the king was penned to please his disciples and copies given to publish in print after his decease for says he we  herd doings of it till now in our last days for abbot archbishop of canterbury primate of all england was the first man that signed to the postcript which attested those articles of the marriage and so did all the privy council then speaking of the excuse made by mr willson for the archbishop this writer adds i can tell him there were two other bishops john bishop of lincoln and lancelot bishop of winchester men of far greater merit and high esteem and evener conscience that subsigned with him but in this fact he is mistaken for lancelot bishop of winchester did not sign more willingly than the archbishop the apology of the other historian was also unnecessary for the articles which the archbishop apprehended and wrote against were private articles as appears plainly from the whole transaction printed in rushworths collection vol i p      0  but another great writer heylin gives quite another turn to this whole affair for he owns that the letter came abroad not in these last times as sanderson calls them but at the very time it was supposed to be written yet he denies that the archbishop was the author of it and suggests that it was only fathered upon him that it might make the greater impression upon the people    the king however remained fixed in his resolution and the articles agreed on for the said marriage were sworn to in the presence of the archbishop and other great officers of state notwithstanding which they never took effect  the archbishop thenceforward assisted but seldom at council being hindered chiefly by his infirmities but in the kings last sickness he was called for and attended with great constancy and received the highest marks of the kings confidence to the very last moment of his life and was near him when he expired on the twentyseventh of march       at the coronation of king charles i the archbishop as his office required set the crown upon his majestys head though he was extremely weak and much troubled with the gout but thenceforward he visibly declined in the kings favor and the duke of buckingham who was his declared enemy watched for an opportunity to make the archbishop feel the weight of his displeasure  this was at last taken for his refusing to license a sermon preached by one dr sibthorpe vicar of brackley in northamptonshire to justify and promote a loan which the king had demanded this sermon was preached at northampton in the lent assizes      before the judges at northampton and it was transmitted to the bishop with the kings direction to license it which he refused to do and gave his reasons for it notwithstanding which the sermon was licensed by the bishop of london dr mountaigne after many things had been corrected therein from the lights given by the archbishops objections for which however it was resolved that he should suffer discourses of this nature were so loud at court that some of his graces friends overheard and reported them to him upon which he thought fit to retire to his palace at croydon a month before his usual time on the fifth of july lord conway who was then secretary of state made him a visit and intimated to him that the king expected he should withdraw to canterbury which the archbishop declined because he had a lawsuit at that time with that city and desired he might rather have leave to go to his house at ford five miles beyond canterbury which was yielded to and on the ninth of october following the king granted a commission to the bishops of london durham rochester oxford and bath and wells to execute archiepiscopal authority the cause assigned being no more than this that the archbishop could not at that time in his own person attend those services which were otherwise proper for his cognizance and jurisdiction some writers have pretended that his supposed irregularity occasioned by the death of peter hawkins was revived but the commission which is extant on record shows the contrary nor indeed was that affair ever thought of afterward but the archbishop did not remain long in this situation for the necessities of the times rendering a parliament necessary his grace was sent for about christmas and not only restored to his authority aad jurisdiction but on his coming to court from his palace at lambeth was received when he quitted his barge by the archbishop of york and the earl of dorset who conducted him to his majesty where having kissed the kings hand he was desired not to fail the council chamber twice a week his grace sat in that parliament which began on the seventeenth of march following and continued in the full exercise of his office ever after of which it may not be amiss to take notice in this single instance on the twentyfourth of august      he consecrated richard montagu to the sea of chichester a man who had been remarkably busy in supporting the pretense of his irregularity and at this consecration dr laud then bishop of london assisted which is the clearest proof that can be that no doubts stuck longer as to his irregularity even with those who loved him least  in parliament the archbishop maintained his credit in as high a degree as any of his predecessors and it is more than probable that the knowledge of this procured him such marks of respect as were at this time afforded him by the court when the petition of right that great pillar of the english liberty was under consideration the archbishop of canterbury delivered the sense of the house of lords thereupon at a conference with the house of commons and at the same time laid before them such propositions as their lordships had agreed upon for which thanks were returned in set speech by sir dudley diggs  the interest of bishop laud was now so great at court that he drew up a scheme of instructions which having the kings name at the head of them were in the month of december      transmitted to his grace under the pompous title his majestys instructions to the most reverend father in god george lord archbishop of canterbury containing certain orders to be observed and put in execution by the several bishops in his province these instructions his grace communicated to his suffragan bishops in which as heylin observes he acted ministerially but to show that he still meant to exercise his own authority in his own diocese he restored mr palmer and mr udnay to their lectureships after the dean and archdeacon of canterbury had suspended them and in other respects softened the rigor of those instructions which were contrived to enforce the particular notions of a prevailing party in the church which the archbishop thought a burden too hard to be borne by the tender consciences of those who made the fundamentals of religion their study and were not so zealous for forms  his conduct in this and other respects is said to have made his presence unwelcome at court and o indeed it seems to have been for upon the birth of charles prince of wales afterward king charles ii which happened on the   th of may    0 laud then bishop of london had the honor to baptize him as dan of the chapel notwithstanding that the archbishop of canterbury is the ordinary of the court and the kings household wherever it is are regarded as his parishioners so this was visibly as much a slight upon the archbishop as an act of favor toward his antagonist  the archbishop however was proof against all such accidents as these and went on doing his duty without fear or favor and yet one of the last acts of his life plainly shows that he was very far from being so indifferent toward the discipline and ceremonies of the church of england as some have represented him this act of his was an order dated the third of july      requiring the parishioners of crayford in kent to receive the sacrament of the lords supper on their knees at the steps ascending to the communion table  we may well style this one of his last acts since a month aterwards viz on the fourth of august in the same year he deceased at his palace of croydon worn out with cares and infirmities at the age of seventyone  he was buried according to his own express direction in the chapel of our lady within the church dedicated to the holy trinity in his native town of guildford in surrey soon after his decease a noble monument was erected over his grave with the effigies of the archbishop in his episcopal robes and over that his parliament robes

humble courtier and one  should have attracted the  laity by the sanctity of  and the uprightness of their behavior rath  have claimed them as neceariy annexed to their function these notions of his  little with the humor of some writers has drawn upon him many reflections that he did not deserve refections that he did not deserve our old church hitorian fuller tells us that he forsook the birds o his own feather to fly with others generaly savouring the laity more than the clergy in causes that were brought bef e him one would imagine from hence that this archbi hop had been a man of great severity in his government  another writer lrange censures his gre for  in visitations and as it is impossible that a man ou b guil of opposite offenses at the same time i m  that he was guilty of neither but that  upon immoral clergymen in the high   and his erness for good men who were  ceemoies exposed the archbishop to such  loved the former too well and had too  mr sanderon strikes much deeper at the a chbishops character for in his history he tells us that his grace grew so much out of humor with the court on the  his regularity upon the accident of  death that he refused because he was not permitted o go to the altar to attend the service of the  able saying to our author since they will have it so that i am incapable of the one i shall spare myself the trouble of the other he adds to this charge a much higher he says that the archbishop fell upon down right puritan principles and had so many church and state malcontents viited him that it produced a new sect who were styled nicodemies and in  for which he gives this wise reason that the archbishop  constantly candle light in his  night at noonday the conclusion of h chrge  the terest of all and therefore i shall  nsribe his own words here he began to be the  m of eminency n u  a ringeader of that faction  i can name  private disciples which  appeared  these passages were first  in  book called  word for word with that in  and death of king james fr m whence it evidently  that he wrote them both yet wi h repect to th   assures us that dr  the archbish  and near relation kn notng  candle in his chamber and study and as to the malcontents that resorted to him the archbishop has fully purged himself of that accusation in the narrative of his troubles this humor of inveighing against the archbishop was not confined to his own times but has prevailed even amongst later writers mr john aubrey having transcribed what is said of this prelate on his monument adds immediately notwithstanding this most noble character transmitted to posterity on this archbishops monument he was though a benefactor to this place no friend to the church of england whereof he was head but scandalously permitted that poisonous spirit of puritanism to spread all over the whole nation by his indolence at least if not connivance and encouragement which some years after broke out and laid a flourishing church and state in the most miserable ruins and which gave birth to those principles which unless rooted out will ever make this nation unhappy i might easily add more instances of the same sort but that i am persuaded the reader will think these sufficient and therefore i shall conclude this note with an observation of fullers in his church history the truth is says he the archbishops own stiffness and averseness to comply with court designs gave advantage to his adversaries against him and made him more obnoxious to the kings displeasure but the blame did most light upon ishop laud men accounting this a kind of filius ante diem etc as if not content to succeed he endeavored to supplant him who might well have suffered his decayed old age to have died in honor what needs the felling of a tree a falling     the general historians of those times ran much into writing of characters and that which hammond lestrange bestowed upon the archbishop has been copied into various works dr heylin in his life of abp laud makes use of it to express what he did not care should fall from his own pen though upon other occasions he has treated this writer in his history very freely lloyd in his state worthies has copied that character without naming his author and to say the truth it is from thence that most of the strokes of satire bestowed upon the memory of this great man have been stolen see the notes  q and  r and yet how little suitable that character is to the person for whom it was drawn the reader will easily perceive from the piece itself from the piece itself the historian writes thus not long after his return from scotland aged and selffear george abbt the titular archbishop of canterbury went to his everlasting home august   a very learned man he was his erudition all of the old stamp stiffly principled in the doctrine of st augutine which they who understand it not call calvinism therefore disrelished by those who inclined to the massilian and armenian tenets pious grave and exemplary in his conversation but foam think a better man than archbishop and that he was better qualified with merit for the dignity than with a spirit answering the function in in the exercise whereof he was conceived too facile and yielding his extraordinary remissness in not exacting strict conformity to the prescibed orders of the church in point of ceremony seemed to resolve those legal determinations to their first principle of indifferency and led in such an habit of inconformity as the future reduction of those tender conscienced men to long discontinued obedience was interpreted an innovation this was the height of what i dare report his failings reached to that he was a ringleader of that sect which lately appeared desperate proselytes loath i am with a late author sanderson to affirm warrant i have none to leave so ill a savor upon his fame nor can it be infallibly inferred from these men their being then in favor with him their principles perhaps were entertained since his death or if before not then declared and until such secrets be discovered men may be mistaken in those they favor the greatest sufferer of these times was so lestranges reign of k charles as injurious as this character is in some points yet it is plain that the author did not credit what mr sanderson had asserted and indeed it is happy for this archbishops memory that almost all his censurers have contradicted each other and thereby afforded just room to posterity to question the truth of what they have all advanced especially en it is considered that in all their censures they enter into the serets of this prelates heart and take upon them to publish to the world what if true could be known only to god and himself    he has not met with much better quarter from the noble historian though there is more of decency preserved in his animadversions as the reader will perceive from the picture of our archbishop drawn by his pen drawn by his pen the earl of clarendon speaks of him thus it was about the end of august in the year      when the king  charles i returned from scotland to greenwih where the queen kept her court and the first accident of mment that happened after his coming thither was the dth of abbot archbishop of canterbury who had sat too many years in that se and had too great a jurisdiction ver the church though he was without any credit in the court from the death of king james and had not much in many yrs before he had been master of one of the poorest eges  i oxford and had learning sufficient for that province he was a man of very morose manners and a very our aspect which in that time was called gravity and under the opinion of that virtue and by the recommendation of the earl of dunbar the kings first scotch favorite he was preferred by king james to the bishopric of coventry and litchfield and presently after to london before he had been parson vicar or curate of any parish church in england or dean or prebendary of any cathedral church and was in truth totally ignorant of the true constitution of the church of england and the state and interest of the clergy as sufficiently appeared throughout the whole course of his life afterward he had scarce performed any part of the office of bishop in the diocese of london when he was snatched from thence and promoted to cnterbury upon the neverenough to be lamented death of dr bancroft that metropolian who understood the church excellently and had almost rescued it out of the calvinian party and very much sbdued the unrly spirit of the nonconformists by and after the conference at hampton court countenanced men of the greatest learning and disposed the clergy to a more solid course of study than they had been accustomed to and if he had lived would quickly have extinguished all that ire in england which had been kindled at geneva or if he had been succeeded by bishop andrews bishop overl or any man who understood and loved the church that infection would easily have been kept out which could not afterward be so easily expelled  but abbot brought none of this antidote with him and considered the christian religion no otherwise than as i abhorred and reviled popery and valued those men most who did that most furiously for the strict observation of the discipline of the church or the conformity of the articles or canons established he made little enquiry and took ls care and having himself made a very little progres in the ancient and solid study of divinity he adhered only to the doctrine of calvin and for his sake did not think so ill of the discipline as he ought to have done but if men prudently forbore a public reviling and railing at the hierarchy and ecclesiastical government let their opinions and private judgment be what it would they were not only secure from any inquisition of his but acceptable to him and at least equally preferred by him and though many other bishops plainly discerned the mischiefs which daily broke in to the prejudice of religion by his defects and remissness and prevented it in their own dioceses as much as they could and gave all their countenance to men of other parts and other principles and though the bishop of london dr laud from the time of his authority and credit with the king had applied all the remedies he could to those defections and from the time of his being chancellor of oxford had much discountenanced and almost suppressed that spirit by encouraging another kind of learning and practice in that university which was indeed according to the doctrine of the church of england yet that temper in the archbishop whose house was a sanctuary to the most eminent of that factious party and who licensed their most pernicious writings left his successor a very difficult work to do to reform and reduce a church into order that had been so long neglected and that was fo ill filled by many weak and more wilful churchmen  history of the rebellion oxon   vo p          a later writer justly esteemed for his perfect knowledge of the english history and not so much addicted to party has done much more justice to the virtues and abilities of this great prelate and therefore we held it reasonable to annex his testimony to these memoirs testimony to these memoirs archbishop abbot says he was a person of wonderful temper and moderation and in all his conduct showed an unwillingness to stretch the act of uniformity beyond what was absolutely necessary for the peace of the church or the prerogative of the crown any farther than conduced to the good of the state being not well turned for a court though otherwise of considerable learning and genteel education he either could not or would not stoop to the humor of the times and now and then by an unseasonable stiffness gave occasion to his enemies to represent him as not well inclined to the prerogative or too much addicted to a popular interest and therefore not fit to be employed in matters of government dr welwoods memoirs   vo   00 p        his charity and public spirit ought certainly to have been set in a clearer light than hitherto they have been by the friends to the church the rather because a writer remarkable for his keenness heylin has been pleased to assert that marks of hisbenesaction we find none in places of his breeding and preferment which is at once an unjust and unchristian aspersion as will be made appear as will be made appear the archbishop loved hospility and living as became a man of his rank he tells us himself in his narrative that this was recommended to him by king james and that he never forgot his majestys injunctions upon that head neither is it the archbishop alone that mentions this but even some who did not wish him very well and who plainly intimate that among the rest of his faults he was thought to live too high to have too much company and to become thereby too popular life of abp laud p     this hospitality of his together with the troubles he met with must have hindered him from growing rich and consequently put it in some measure out of his power to show his public spirit in other respects how much soever it might be his inclination yet some instances we find of his generosity in this way at least enough to falsify heylins reflection for besides his noble and wellcontrived charity at guildford he gave to the school of arts in oxford one hundred pounds at one time and fifty pounds at another in      he bestowed a large sum of money on the library of baliol college for augmenting the number of books and repairing the building he built a fair conduit in the city of canterbury for the convenience of the inhabitants he likewise intended to have left a yearly revenue for the support of that conduit if he had not been deterred by the ungratesul usage he met with from the mayor and corporation as may be seen in the will in      he contributed to the founding of pembroke college in oxford he discharged a debt of three hundred pounds owing from baliol to pembroke college about the year      he gave one hundred pounds to the library of university college for the other see the archbishops will   in regard to his

of the house of commons character of archbishop abbot upon reading lord clarendons account of him which see pages    and    of this work that worthy prelate did surely deserve a better representation to posterity he was a very wise and prudent man knew well the temper and disposition of the kingdom with respect to the ceremonies and power of the church and did therefore use a moderation in the point of ecclesiastical discipline which if it had been followed by his successor the ruin that soon after fell on the church might very likely have been prevented his being without any credit at court from the latter end of king jamess reign will bring no dishonor on his memory if it be considered that his disgrace arose from his dislike of and opposition to the imprudent and corrupt measures of the court at that time and from an honest zeal for the laws and liberties of his country which seemed then to be in no small danger and it was a part truly becoming the high station he then bore his advice upon the affair of the palatinate and the spanish match showed his knowledge of the true interest of england and how much it was at his heart and his behavior and sufferings in the next reign about the loan and sibthorps sermon as they were the reasons of his disgrace at that time so ought they to render his memory valuable to all who wish not to see the fatal counsels and the oppression of those times revived in this nation the duke of buckingham was his enemy because the archbishop would not be his creature and the church perhaps might have been thought to have been better governed if he had stooped to the duke and given in to the wantonnesses of his power but he knew the dignity of his character and loved his country too well to submit to such a meanness though very few of his brethren had the courage or honesty to join with him in this and if the archbishop himself is to be credited vide his narrative  his successors rise was by the practice of those arts this good man could not bend to as to his learning we need no better testimony of it than his promotion by king james who had too much affectation that way to prefer any one to such a station who had not borne the reputation of a scholar but there are other proofs of his sufficiency in this even for the high place he held in the church if he had some narrow notions in divinity they were rather the faults of the age he had his education in than his and the same imputation may be laid on the best and most learned of the reformers his warmth against popery became the office of a protestant bishop though even toward papists there is a see rushworths collections vol  st page     remarkable instance of his mildness and charity which showed that his zeal against their persons went no farther than the safety of the state required his parts seem to have been strong and masterly his preaching grave and eloquent and his style equal to any of that time he was eminent for piety and a care for the poor and his hospitality fully answered the injunction king james laid on him which was to carry his house nobly and to live like an archbishop he had no thoughts of heaping up riches what he did save was laid out by him in the erecting and endowing of an handsome hospital for decayed tradesmen and the widows of such in the town of guildford in the county of surrey where he was born and had his first education and here i cannot omit taking notice that the body of statutes drawn by himself for the government of that house is one of the most judicious works of that kind i ever saw and under which for near one hundred years that hospital has maintained the best credit of any that i know in england he was void of all pomp and ostentation and thought the nearer the church and churchmen came to the simplicity of the first christians the better would the true ends of religion be served and that the purity of the heart was to be preferred to and ought rather to be the care of a spiritual governor than the devotion of the hands only if under this notion some niceties in discipline were given up to goodness of life and when the peace of the church as well as of the kingdom was preserved by it twas surely no ill piece of prudence nor is his memory therefore deserving of those slanders it has undergone upon that account it is easy to see that much of this treatment has been owing to a belief in the admirers and followers of archbishop laud that the reputation of the latter was increased by depreciating that of the former they were indeed men of very different frames and the parts they took in the affairs both of church and state as difagreeing in the church moderation and the ways of peace guided the behavior of the first rigor and severity that of the last in the state they severally carried the like principles and temper the one made the liberty of the people and the laws of the land the measure of his actions when the other to speak softly of it had the power of the prince and the exalting the prerogative only for the foundation of his they were indeed both of em men of courage and resolution but it was sedate and temperate in abbot passionate and unruly in laud it is not however to be denied that many rare and excellent virtues were possessed by the latter but it must be owned too he seems rather made for the hierarchy of another church and to be the minister of an arbitrary prince and the other to have had the qualifications of a protestant bishop and the guardian of a free state thus much i thought was due to the character of this good man not only for the sake of justice but as an offering of gratitude to his memory for the great and lasting obligations the town of guildford to which i have some relation lies under to him and what i have here said of him i am amply justified in from several accounts delivered down of him from letters and other pieces of his own in rushworths collections vol    and from the statutes of his hospital beforementioned and other memorials of his worth which are there preserved  july the  0th      a o it is not perhaps unworthy of observation that in england calvinism went along with civil liberty and arminianism the contrary and that in holland it was at the same time the very reverse    archbishop abbots will the will of george abbot late lord archbishop of canterbury      in the name of almighty

in so many troubles as this inconstant world does afford his divine majesty did ever protect and uphold me and so i trust that high and great god will out of his incomprehensible love do unto the end then i commend my soul unto the blessed trinity the father who created it the son who redeemed it the holy ghost who in some measure has sanctified it beseeching that god in trinity and the same trinity in unity to receive it into the kingdom of heaven there to reign for ever for jesus christs sake by whose death and bitter passion only which that unspotted and innocent lamb did suffer for the sins of the world i steadfastly hope to have full and free remission of all my offenses according to the truth of the gospel now by his great mercy published in this famous church of england which i hold to be the best framed pattern of all the churches in europe and according to the doctrine which in my lifetime for full forty years together when i write this i have taught in my preaching and maintained in my writing and in the verity whereof because it is grounded upon the sacred scriptures of the old and new testament i hope to appear with cheerfulness and confidence before the throne of god  i commend my body to the earth in assured hope of a joyful resurrection desiring to be buried in the trinity church at guildford which is near unto my hospital that in the same town where my flesh had the beginning thereof it may rest as the depositum of my love to that place but i leave all circumstances of my interring and funeral to the judgment and discretion of mine executors  i give to the poor of the parish of lambeth thirty pounds and to the poor of the parish of croydon twenty pounds both these sums to be disposed according to the discretion of mine executors and if it may be it is best that they should be directed to some permanent use  i have heretofore given to the mayor and his brethren at guildford one hundred pounds see the letter to the corporation of guildford  which sum is in their hands or at least in their disposing i declared it so at first and my desire is that it should be preserved to a perpetual use to be lent by five and twenty pounds a man to four several tradesmen in that town to set poor men on work i would not have these sums to be lent but upon good security and to hold for two or three years at the most without any interest or consideration saving paying for making the bonds and then to be lent from time to time to other traders there with this proviso upon the bonds that if any of the borrowers to die before the end of the term for which the money is lent that the sum be repayed or delivered back to the mayor and his brethren within three months after his decease  to him whosoever shall succeed me in the archbishopric i give all the pictures and maps now hanging in the gallery at lambeth together with my barge praying him not to grieve my executors for dilapidations since it appears to the world how careful i have been in repairing all the houses belonging to the sea of canterbury beyond that which my predecessors have done in the memory of man and that i have bestowed diverse thousands of pounds upon the same as may well be seen by books of accounts truly kept concerning those expenses besides the care which to my great charge i have had for the preservation of the woods of the archbishopric standing in kent and surrey which i have so spared beyond my predecessors that i have bought timber to the value of some hundreds of pounds to repair my houses because i would not cut young trees but let them grow up to the benefit of my succcessors and being now fair i leave it humbly to his majestys consideration whether it be not fit that my successor and successors to enter good bond into the exchequer not to cut any timber saving for necessary reparations of his own houses which was the course holden in queen elizabeths days especially for the bishopric of winchester and not unfit elsewhere to be followed i have many books in the great study or library at lambeth marked with these two letters g c i bequeath those to that library to the use of the archbishops of canterbury in succession and i appoint that a catalogue should be made of them and sent to the dean and chapter of the cathedral church in canterbury to be there kept and a transcipt or copy thereof to remain in the library at lambeth the cost of this i leave to my executors but pray mr baker my secretary to take some pains therein for that which shall remain unperfected by me which i hope shall not be much yet in that which shall be i would have mr baker to take the advice of my houhold chaplains being with me in house at the time of my death and because i am not ignorant that by falsehood cavils in law or some negligence not only those books given by me but those which were left by my lord bancroft may be diverted from the use of my successors and so this great and good work be frustrated as far as in me lies i do in the name of that dreadful and almighty god who is the rewarder of all mens deservings be they good or be they evil lay it upon the soul and conscience of him and them that shall succeed me in this archbishopric that to the best of their power by all means they keep that library and all the books safe as i have done and i pray god to bless all them that have that good mind and to divert and hinder all those that have any intendment to the contrary and this i pray not only for and concerning my successors but all other persons whatsoever  my next general care is of my servants among whom i do not know any unhonest or unworthy man my will for them is that my household should by my executors be kept together at my charge for the space of one month after my decease that men may have some time to dispose of themselves and to begin with the poorest i do give two hundred pounds to be divided by my executors unto forty yeomen or inferior of my servants by five pounds a year and i give forty pounds more to supply any forgetfulness of mine toward such as have served me or if the sum beforenamed do not hold out those last moneys to be disposed by the discretion of mine executors toward gentlemen or yeomen where they shall see fit and according to what proportion they shall hold most convenient those to whom i give particular legacies are to have none of this two hundred and the forty pounds but my servan s at croydon are to be taken in to such gentlemen as at the time of my death shall serve me in house and have no portions or named legacies i give to each of them a gold ring to the value of forty shillings to wear in remembrance of me and i entreat my successor whosoever he shall be to entertain so many of my servants as he shall need assuring him that he can not have more honest and serviceable persons to attend him  to sir edmond scott i give my little silver clock and a trencher salt of gold without a cover which remains among my plate and this he must receive as a memorial of my love because otherwise by my means he is not ill provided for although if if it were more he is worthy of it  to mr richard brigham the controller of my house i give my four coach mares and one hundred pounds in money he knows that i have not been altogether forgetful of him in my lifetime but all that i have done is too little because his faithfulness diligence and discretion has been such in serving me that my estate by his means has been the better within doors and without  to my two chaplains attending me in mine house i give my pictures and maps in the gallery at croydon to be divided between them and to each of them a ring of gold of forty shillings and such another ring i give to my chaplain master edward abbott of loarkin  to my secretary master william baker as honest a man as ever served any master i give my gold ring with the table diamond to wear in remembrance of me praying him to take some pains to perfect up the catalogue of my books given to the library at lambeth that it may orderly appear to posterity what i have left there according to the care that i did take for the books left by my predecessor the lord bancroft the founder and first beginner of that library i give him also the great inlayed cabinet of wood standing in the queens chamber at lambeth the keys whereof lie in the old desk which stands in the study which is next to the closet near the chapel  to master richard line i bequeath my lesser gold chain and twenty pounds of money if he owe me so much at the time of my death i have done something for him in my lifetime according to my ability and it may fall out that i may do more  to master william sherman i give a gold ring with a turtoyse in it which i have ready lying by me and a piece of gilt plate of thirty ounces i have not altogether forgotten him heretofore in some other matters  to honest john goodwyn i give one hundred marks in money and my big clock which uses commonly to stand in my chamber i have much desired to leave him some office or matter of continuance but god hitherto has not offered me the means to do it according to my desire  to ralph watts who long has served me painfully and diligently i give also one hundred marks in money and a gold ring with a turkoise in it i have done something for him besides but i wish it were much more  to walter dobson my receiver and the receiver of the archbishopric i give twenty pounds and the ring with the westindian sapphire which i have used to wear having my arms cut in it i hope he has not utterly lost his time under me and therefore he will be content with this remembrance of him i leave him also my little written book with the blue strings wherein are set down the leases and woods and provisions belonging to the archbishopric i would have him keep it to himself for it may be of good use unto him  to george aisme my page and godson i give ten pounds and one of the summer nags which i have running amongst my horses  to master john heart sometime solicitor of my causes i give all the arrearages of young livesays wardship if any be behind and i give him also a gold ring with a turtoise in it  i bequeath to robert clarke yeoman of my horse ten pounds and so much i give also to george hollist  i give moreover to master francis harton master john goodwin and ralph watts the remainder of young peytons wardship to be equally divided amongst them as it has been heretofore to walter dobson i give that which is left of turveys wardship videlicet fifty shillings yearly and to george hollis the remainder of pole wheelers wardship so long as it does continue i do not know the time but it is fifty shillings by the year  to sir dudley diggs my ancient pupil in oxford i give my ring set with an orient sapphire and all my antique coins of gold silver and brass which are in my study at lambeth  to sir henry martin dean of the arches and my good friend i bequeath all my serpentine cups and vessels which i give him that when he sees ruseth t h em he may think of me  to master sergeant hendon my old oxford acquaintance and friend careful in my lawbusiness i give the fair bible which lies in a white box standing in that room wherein i have heretofore ordinarily studied while i remained at lambeth  to the dean and chapter of canterbury i do give five and twenty of those books which now remain in my study at croydon and i do give five and twenty more to be taken after the other from thence to the dean and chapter of winchester to be put into their several libraries and these i wish my executors to choose out with the privity and some advice of the dean or vicedean of those churches for the time being supposing that they wish to have such books as be not in their libraries already  for baliol college i have done diverse things already and if god send me life i have a purpose to let them taste something more of my courtesy  there is a lease of two houses which was taken in the name of my brother sir morris abbot as he very well knows my will is that my executors do so order it that twenty pounds yearly out of the benefit arising by that lease be paid to my brother john abbot of guildford during his life if the lease do so long continue and other twenty pounds yearly arising from that lease i appoint to be paid to the wife of peter hawkins sometime of bramsil in hampshire for so long as the said woman does live and no longer what benefit may be made by the renewing the under leases together with the remainder of the time after the decease of my brother john and the wife of peter hawkins i give to my nephew mr maurice abbot of the inner temple and i pray my executors that these things may be truly performed according to my honest meaning  to sir nathaniel brent and his wife my kinswoman he daughter of my brother doctor abbot sometime bishop of salisbury i give a piece of gilt plate of thirty ounces and i do further declare that it is my purpose and intent that one paper or instrument under my hand and seal made for her benefit and now in her custody should take place according to the conditions and time therein specified this paper bears date the tenth of january one thousand six hundred and twenty and my will is that the like paper should be available and take place in behalf of master edward leonthorpe sometimes my servant i do leave power sufficient to my executors to see these things performed  i do give also to the said niece of mine the lady martha brent the gilt basin and ewer which the lord thomas earl of dorset sometime lord treasurer of england and in his lifetime my honorable good master gave unto me by his will as a legacy they may easily be known because they have engraven upon them the arms of his lordship  i bequeath to my brother sir morris abbot knight my great silver hourglass with the case wherein it is kept as a special remembrance of me  to his son my nephew master maurice abbot student of the inner temple i do give my bigger chain of gold to wear when he sees cause and otherwise to keep in memory of me i give to him all the profits that may be raised of the lease of the priory of dover which in his name is taken of the archbishop of canterbury to make use of it to himself after my decease and there be some petty leases now fit to be demised the benefit whereof i give unto him he knows what i have done for him besides and i doubt not but he will safely keep a paper of directions which i have heretofore given unto him  to my brother john abbot i bequeath twenty pounds and to his wife a piece of gilt plate of twenty ounces to their daughter sarah say i give twenty pounds and a piece of gilt plate of twenty ounces and i give to my other niece damaris bingstey a piece of plate of thirty ounces gilt to john abbot their brother i give a ring of forty shillings and no more because i have otherwise provided for him already god send him to use it aright and to perform those things which by writing i have given him in charge  i had a purpose to have left some yearly revenue for the maintenance of a conduit which i built in the town of canterbury but the mayor of that city and his brethren by the instigation of two or three persons have used me so unrespectfully and ungratefully that i have held it fit to alter that purpose  to the clerk of my kitchen  shelton i give ten pounds and so much to george hodges also ten pounds to william harrison my tailor  i do give to master simon hayward that serves me fifty pounds  to the princess the lady elizabeth daughter to my old lord and master king james of england i give one hundred pounds to make a pretty cup of gold in token of my dutiful respect and service to her princely dignity  i do give to my niece margaret marsh one hundred pounds to bestow upon some jewel to be worn in memory of me and the like sum i give and to the same purpose to my niece mrs elizabeth tresham and the like sum i give to my niece mrs mary diggs and so much to my niece mrs martha abbot be she married or unmarried i bequeath to my nephew mr edward abbot merchant for his wife one hundred pounds  i designed before two hundred pounds to be distributed among my poorer servants at the rate of five pounds a man i do now add unto it two hundred pounds more to be divided amongst them so that there will be ten pounds a year for each of them  to james sowthis i do give for a legacy twenty pounds  touching the hospital erected by me in guildford where i was born and my parents of good memory long inhabited i have finished the main building and if there be any thing of decency or ornament convenient to be added thereunto if god permit me life i shall accomplish those also i have procured from my old sovereign king james of blessed memory a gracious mortmain and i have devised statutes for the good government thereof which i have caused formerly to be set down and i have sent them to the hospital i may peradventure add some small things unto those statutes during my life but if after my decease any thing appear not to be perfect i leave the charge of the explaining the same unto my executors to whom i leave a power to change circumstances if necessity so require provided that they keep the substance of mine intendment my purpose in the first place is to maintain there one master of the hospital twelve poor brothers and eight poor sisters all aged persons of honest report but my intent in the second place is that some manufacture be set up in that town of guildford to find work for the younger sort of people and to that end i have begun the work already and besowed a good stock upon it for the prosecution of this manufacture i crave the furtherance of the mayor and his brethren in that town wishing that they will jointly agree together for the best course to promote that business the honor will be gods the reputation will be theirs and will be a great benefit to that town if their poor be set on work i would have my executors and the master of the hospital ever willing and ready to help forward mine intention and if they all look at the public and not too much at the private god will give a great blessing unto it i have appointed a room for the workhouse and i hope it be already fitted thereto for the endowment of the poor of the hospital i have bought land at merrow of one master harwood and i have already passed it to that house if there be no such conveyance made i do by this my will give that land to the master and brethren of that hospital i have bought also of one master goodwin lands at meredin or lands called meredin to the rent of forty pounds by the year and of one constable i have bought land at horsham yielding rent to the value of forty pounds by the year these two parcels i do give to my hospital for ever and i would have my executors to help forward those donations of mine if there be cause but no way to hinder them i have bought of thomas hill land at ewhurst for the yearly rent of twentyseven pounds ten shillings if it shall seem fit to mr george duncan to have this land changed i shall not be against it so that there be as much land for value and a good title laid in lieu of it but be it one or the other i give it to my hospital for the upholding of the manufacture set up by me in guildford i do give one hundred pounds a year for ever to the said my hospital that is to say threescore pounds a year bought of master bishe and forty pounds by the year lying at charlewood and bought of one polsdon and howsoever perhaps i do not hitt on the right names of the sellers or the places where these lands lie i will that it be no hinderance to this my donation or donations but that the possessions be made good to the master and brethren of my hospital i intended for the maintenance of the poor of my hospital two hundred pounds by the year and now by the releasing of certain wood ground bought of one bromfield of katherinehill near guildford there wants the rent of twelve pounds ten shillings yearly charged upon my hospital if i provide not this in my lifetime i require my executors to supply it with speed but i am upon a bargain in sussex which i hope shall clear it up all and whereas my good friend sir nicholas kempe did by his last will and testament give five hundred pounds to be bestowed on some good work as i should think meet i here declare that i have bestowed that whole sum upon some of the lands beforementioned to be bought and conveyed to my hospital which i do being warranted thereunto not only by the general words of his will but by particular signification from himself for he was present when i laid the first stone of the chapel for that hospital and gave me one hundred pounds toward the work and since from to time and lately before his death being with me at croydon he voluntarily assured me he would be mindful of that house and foundation and whereas he does not in his will specially name the hospital i conceive the reason of it out of true ground to be because he did not know whether i would have any mans name used in the founding of that house and corporation besides mine own but i declare him now a principal and the only benefactor of moment to that place and i have caused mention to be made of it in the statutes of that house that he did confer to that foundation six hundred pounds which to posterity will be an honor and memorial to that good knight sometime an officer in the archbishopric and to me  for the performance of this my last will and testament i must appoint some person or persons to take care i having a good part been mine own executor having already distributed with mine own hands much of that little which god has given unto me but yet for the further accomplishing of that which i intend and for the disposing of my funeral i appoint my executors my brother sir morris abbot knight and my nephew mr maurice abbot of the inner temple barrister not doubting but care will be taken that all things shall be performed according to my true meaning above expressed whatsoever is remaining my funeral charges excepted be it money bonds plate debts cattle or other movables will fall to mine executors who i doubt not but will take pains for the performance of my will and among other things will look that my note books which are written with mine own hand be safely kept such legacies as i have given to my servants i wish to be satisfied with all convenient speed especially to those who are the poorer of them and the like i declare for that which is by me bequeathed to the parishes of lambeth and croydon there is no great matter to be done to my hospital but if any small thing be requisite i would have it done as soon as may be  so beseeching almighty god to increase the number of his faithful to abate more and more daily the strength of antichrist and popery to send peace and prosperity to this island to bless our sovereign my most gracious lord and master the king with long life and happiness and to send him a fair and plentiful issue i commend my soul again and again to the mercy of my most blessed savior and redeemer  july         g cant proved in the prerogative court of canterbury a worthy and memorable letter received from the lord of canterbury his grace memorand that the letter underwritten being sent to this town before this day by the lord archbishop of canterbury his grace for special reasons is ordered to be registered on record and follows in these words viz after my hearty commendations i do not live so far from you but that i many times do enquire of the state of your town which because it was the place of my beginning i cannot choose but have in extraordinary recommendation and understanding that it has not pleased god to give unto it that flourishing estate for trade and traffic which i have known it sometime to have i have often both in meditation with myself and in consideration with some of my friends your well willers debated by what means i might give the best furtherance unto the same wherein if i shall acquaint you with my thoughts you will bear with me because they all proceed from a good mind toward you and if i err in any thing upon information i shall quickly be reformed first therefore you must know that considering my perpetual expense my means are not great to bring about some such thing as my heart has desired as perhaps for the erecting of some hospital as my most worthy predecessor the lord archbishop whitgift did at croydon the like whereof would require a full purse and long continuance of time in the place which i hold whereof no man can take to himself any assurance since we are daily in the hand of god and enjoy our breath but at his pleasure but in this i do not forget that this may be a relief for some few aged folks but the generality of the town is not the better for it whereas if the corporation did thrive and flourish those poor and aged people would easily be maintained by the charity of such as be of best ability  some other time my mind has run upon bestowing of some stock upon the town that men who do trade might have some money lent them for two or three years freely putting in some good security to the mayor and his brethren to repay the same again that so the stock may go from hand to hand and be preserved to posterity but here i have thought that if trade be not good this can little avail for a well meaning man may be decayed and not only lose that which is lent unto him but that also which he has of his own and then to force sureties to pay his debt is to weaken the estate of other who did undertake for him upon these and the like deliberations i have thought then with myself what course there may be taken for the advancing of trade amongst you which will set the poor on work and may be a benefit unto the commonwealth and the thing which i most pitch upon is clothing because both town and country has been accustomed thereunto and yet herein i confess that the making of your kersies does give me little satisfaction because sometimes they are up for the price and sometimes they are down and as far as i can learn by the merchants which deal for cloth there is not great hope in that kind of any certainty hereafter  so that this putting me to seek further i have entered into consideration whether it were not good to fall to the making of stuffes as they call them as say serge dorincks durance perpetuana and other of that kind which might employ the wool growing thereabout and exercise the people in labor and here i find as many difficulties for it is a great attempt to alter the trade of a town so far from the former course thereof and perhaps a glutt of them may cause them to be as ill vented as other cloths are now  thus out of my love to the place of my birth and to you all i stand distracted what to do if god should make me able to effect any thing for you but after all those ways abovenamed my meditations have fallen upon this whether in probability the making of broad cloth either blues or mingled or white be not a likelier trade to thrive than that which is now used and if there may be appearance thereof for certainty i know there is none in any mortal thing the greatest will be to alter the tools which now are as racks mills etc into those which are convenient for the making of broad cloth now in this methinks i may give you some help if i shall do as the low countrymen lately have promised to do to their people the more to invite them to the making of cloth that is to bestow four or five pound upon every man that will set up a loom at first and in like proportion to the alteration of mills and other instruments fit for that whereof i speak which if god do bless me i shall be willing to do to some reasonable quantity if it may do good unto that corporation the welfare whereof i so much desire  my request unto you mr mayor and to your brethren is that you will think upon these things and meeting together at your own opportunities deliberate what may be most available for the place wherein you live which i would have you to beat and beat again with yourselves and others before you return me an answer lest if any alteration should hastily be and it should have ill success blame should be laid upon me when i have not deserved it and if you can find out any other matter than those which i have thought upon if they be not of too great charge i shall upon consultation easily condescend unto your desire for i have a meaning to do you some good as god shall send me life and afford me ability  in token whereof i have now dispatched away one hundred pounds which i trust my countryman mr robert parkhurst will see by exchange conveyed unto you and this money i would have to be no way employed but to be laid up in safe custody until such time as i shall give order for the using of the same upon such resolution as i shall receive jointly from you and so thanking you for sundry remembrances which at several times i have received from you i forbear at this time to be further troublesome to you but leave you to the good blessing of the almighty  from lambeth dec         your very loving friend g cant  depiction of trinity hospital guildford trinity hospital in guildford surrey  a description of the hospital with

ordained or provided or for any other thing cause or matter whatsoever to the contrary hereof in any wise notwithstanding in testimony of which we have caused these our letters to be made patents witness ourself at westminster the twentieth day of june in the year of our reign over england france and ireland the twentieth and over scotland the fiftyfifth  by writ from our privy seal young and pie  the founders statutes for the good government of the hospital of the blessed trinity in guildford surrey the oath of the kings supremacy i a b do utterly testify and declare in my conscience that the kings highness is the only supreme governor of this realm and of all other his highnesss dominions and countries as well spiritual and ecclesiastical things and causes as temporal and that no foreign prince person prelate state or potentate has or ought to have any jurisdiction power superiority preeminence or authority ecclesiastical or sprtitual within this realm and therefore i do utterly renounce and forsake all foreign jurisdiction power superiority and authority and do promise that from henceforth i will bear faith and true allegiance to the kings highness his heirs and lawful successors and to my power will assist and defend all jurisdictions privileges preeminence and authority granted or belonging to the kings highness his heirs and successors or united or annexed to the imperial crown of this realm of england  so help me god and the contents of this book  the statutes of the hospital the preface forasmuch as every christian man is bound according to the measure of grace and mercy which he has received from god to render back again to his eternal father such tokens of gratefulness and thankfulness as are in his power and i george abbott archbishop of canterbury from the mere mercy of the blessed god besides the inward graces of his holy spirit having been partaker of some earthly and worldly benefits more than most of my birth and rank has attained unto i have held it agreeable with my duty to leave behind me to posterity some monument of my thankfulness to my creator and some testimony of my faith in christ jesus which if it bring not forth some fruits to his glory is to be held but as a dead and unprofitable faith and therefore my affection leading me to the town of guildford wherein i was born and where my aged parents lived many years in good repute i have thought upon erecting an hospital there which i have dedicated to the blessed trinity and intending that poor people should be maintained therein think good to lay down certain statutes and ordinances which shall be for the governing of the master brothers and sisters there as also of all other persons who are therein to be placed and of the guidement of the possessions and rents which god has and may enable me to bestow upon the same in the name therefore of the father son and holy ghost who directs my pen aright i thus begin  chap i of the master and his office there can be no body of people be governed but there must be a head to direct and oversee all the rest of the members this head i appoint to be the master whose office shall be to rule and govern all the rest with mildness and love if it may be otherwise moderate severity if there be just cause  he shall require of the brethren and sisters the due observation of the ordinances and statutes he shall keep one key of the common chest and another of the evidence house that nothing be done there without his knowledge he shall cause the gate of the hospital to be opened and locked at due times appointed and night by night shall have the key brought unto him he shall be present when any one is admitted and whenever wages or allowances are to be paid he shall be careful to preserve and defend the lands and inheritances of the house and to that end shall see the evidences well and safely laid up he shall see that all entries be duly made in the ledger book he shall look in time to all reparations and all other good husbandry of the hospital being careful that no fire or candle be dangerously kept if any lodging be void he shall keep the key thereof till it be delivered to some brother or sister which is newly to be admitted  chap ii of the quality of the master this master of the hospital i appoint to be a man fearing god of good name and fame of fifty years of age at the least born or having lived twenty years before in the town of guildford which i will have evermore to be understood within the compass which is governed by the mayor and no otherwise he shall be at his election or nomination a single or unmarried man and so shall continue so long as he remains master and if he thinks fit to marry and does so indeed i appoint that on peril of the breach of his oath he leave the place within three days to a new election or nomination if any person has been mayor of the town and has governed with good report he shall be capable of this place and so shall the minister who is parson of trinity church in guildford although he was not born in the town so that either of these be single men and furnished with the rest of the conditions named in this chapter he shall as near as may be a provident man acquainted with the affairs of the world especially for letting or selling of land or turning it to the best benefit of the place where he is master  chap iii of the manner how the master shall be chosen or appointed i do reserve unto myself the nomination of the master so long as it pleases god that i shall live and after my decease i appoint that if the place shall be void by the death resignation or expulsion of the former master that then the vicemaster or in his absence the senior brother shall as soon as may be give notice to the electors that the place is void that so they may meet together in the chapel of the hospital to make a new choice the electors i appoint to be five the mayor of guildford or in his absence his deputy the parson of trinity parish and if he be not in town the parson of st nicholas parish and three of the brethren of the hospital that is to say the vicemaster and the two senior or most ancient brethren and look on whom the greater part of these five shall agree he shall be admitted to the place of master these shall proceed without favor or affection or without any corruption whatsoever directly or indirectly as in the presence of god who judges righteously touching the good or evil actions of all men in the day of christ this election i appoint to be within four and twenty hours of the being void of the mastership or at least within that space after it shall known that the place is void and if within that time it be not supplied by a new election i then order that by way of devolution it shall fall to the archbishop of canterbury to be nominated by him according to my statutes and if the sea of canterbury be void or the archbishop sede plena shall not design the master within twelve days then it shall be in the omination of the bishop of winton for the time being and if that see be also void or the bishop sede plena shall not appoint the master within seven days then sir george moor of loseley knt or after his decease the heir of his house whoever he shall be from time to time shall have the sole appointing and designing of the master which if it be not completed within five days the choice shall return to the first five electors when the election or nomination is thus passed the person elected or nominated shall in the presence of all the brethren of the house in the chapel of the hospital take first the oath of sovereignty and obedience to the kings majesty his lawful heirs and successors as by law prescribed and then this oath here ensuing  i a b from henceforth so long as i shall continue and remain master of this hospital shall and will by gods assistance do my best endeavors to perform fulfill and obey the statutes ordinances and constitutions of the same so far as they concern me and shall do my best that the rest of the brethren andsisters as also all others that are under me do keep and observe the same i shall not hereafter at any time procure or willingly give assent unto the hurt endangering or endamaging of the said hospital in the hereditaments or any of the moveable goods thereof or in any thing that may concern the estate or welfare thereof but to my best skill and power shall defend promote and set forward the benefit and commodity thereof while i live so help me god in christ jesus  chap iv of the vicemaster the master and the five senior brethren that be at home shall the morrow after michaelmas day yearly choose a vicemaster one of the gravest and best understanding who shall govern in the masters absence as is prescribed in these statutes and the rest of the brethren and sisters shall for that year yield unto him a regard and due respect the election shall be made by the major part where the masters voice shall be accounted two and at the end of the year he shall have a stipend of thirteen shillings and fourpence out of the common chest he shall keep one of the keys of the evidence house and another key of the common chest and in the absence of the master he shall night by night have the keys of the hospital brought unto him  chap v of the poor brethren and sisters who are capable of that place the head being thus settled the members are to be added which must complete the body on the right side i put the poor men whom i call brethren and on the left side the poor women whom i term sisters i ordain that such as are to be nominated into these places be persons of good name and fame no drunkards or noted for contention no lepers or such as have any contagious infectious or incurable disease none such as at any time have been known to have begged from door to door but such as in their younger years have honestly labored and by age impotency or other hand of god be grown poor and fallen to decay such only as have been born in the town of guildford or at least have lived there for twenty years before i will that they be threescore years of age before they be chosen single and unmarried persons and so to remain else if they do afterward marry by virtue of their oaths they are to leave the hospital and all interest they have therein within two days and among these i would have preferred such as have born office or have been good traders in the town whereby they have set others on work if any of them be fallen into poverty such as have been soldiers sent or chosen out of guildford and have ventured their lives or lost their blood for their prince and country and if any be of my kindred or have served my father or me i would have them to be capable although they were not born in guildford nor be of the age abovenamed so that at one time there be not above three of my kindred or more than three at once that have been my servants and so that otherwise they be qualified as before  chap vi the manner of choosing the brothers and sisters the nomination of these during my life i reserve to myself but after my decease i appoint that the first place that falls void be it brother or sister be filled and named by the mayor of guildford or in his absence by his deputy and the second place by the master of the hospital or in his absence by the master of the free school in guildford and so turn after turn the third by the mayor or his deputy the fourth by the master or schoolmaster and so forward for ever i do ordain that this nomination be perfected and accomplished within four and twenty hours after the known death or avoidance of any formerly possessed with the place and if the mayor or deputy for their turns do not design the person to be supplied within the space abovenamed then my will is that the parson of the parish of st nicholas do appoint him or her that is to succeed and if the master of the hospital or the schoolmaster do not design for their turns the person to be supplied by them within the space aforesaid then my will is that the parson of trinity parish do appoint him or her that is to succeed and if the said person be not at that time at home then the master of the hospital which if he be not then at the nomination shall fall to the parson of st marys church in guildford all which nominations i would have to be as in the presence of god without corruption or filthy lucre without favor or sinister affection for i give unto these persons this power only upon trust and not to make a gain of that which i have spared from my back and from my belly and from my kindred and from some other good use in some other place to bestow for gods sake on the poor members of christ in this town the lord forbid that any man should abuse this my charity for which he did never sweat or labor  the manner of these nominations i ordain to be that the mayor master of the hospital or other person in whom the power of appointing or designing for that turn is do come into the chapel of the said hospital and there before four or more of the brethren do name him or her whom in his conscience he finds fittest which being done the master or vicemaster shall conduct the person so named to the chamber which is void which he or she shall presently enjoy but not have any other allowance of the house till the end of one quarter of a year the money that is to be saved being to be put into the common chest of the hospital to supply reparations lawsuits and other casualties but after the end of three months the brother or sister designed shall in the chapel of the hospital before the master or vicemaster first take the oath of allegiance or obedience to the kings majesty as by law it is prescribed and then this oath ensuing  i a b from henceforth so long as i shall remain a member of this hospital of the blessed trinity in guildford shall and will by gods assistance do my best endeavor to fulfill and keep the statutes and ordinances of the same so far forth as they concern me i shall be obedient to the master of the hospital in all reasonable and honest things i shall not at any time willingly procure or give assent unto any indangering or endamaging of the said hospital either in the estate hereditaments or moveable goods thereof but to my best power and skill shall defend and set forward the welfare and commodity thereof whilst i live so help me god in jesus christ  here i think fit to add this that because it may fall out that there be not men or women of threescore years of age and single persons in the town to supply such places as are void as in my own lifetime i found once by experience that there were not i do give license that in such case and no other some aged married man or woman be chosen which is of quality and conditions otherwise agreeable to my statutes but in the choice of such a person i will have the consent of the mayor of guildford the master of the hospital and the parson of trinity parish all concurring because i will not have this done but upon necessity this man or woman shall have the weekly allowance os the house and nothing else and shall be called by the name of an outbrother or an outsister  chap vii of the service of god among or above all things that such persons as remain in the hospital are to do it is first to take care that god be served who is the giver and continuer of all good things the master therefore of the hospital shall so often as he conveniently can read some part of divine service according to the book of common prayer morning and evening in the chapel of the hospital to the brethren and sisters and give god thanks for their founder and all other gods benefits and blessings and this to be every day except those hereafter mentioned and if the master does not perform it himself then the vicemaster whom i would have always chosen such a one as can handsomely read or in his absence such a one of the brothers as the master shall appoint shall without grudging perform that office there can no man be too good to serve god on the sabbath days festivaldays wednesdays and fridays at morning and evening prayers and at saturdays at evening prayers all the brethren and sisters of the hospital being at home and not sick except the porter who is to tarry at home to keep the house in the absence of the rest shall repair two and two in orderly fashion to trinity church which is near unto them and there devoutly pray with the rest of the congregation for the preservation of the kings majesty his children and issue when god sends them as also for the happiness and prosperity of his kingdoms and hear the word of god preached and read and there be partakers of the lords supper at least thrice every year and to the end all persons that are able may be present at prayers in the chapel or parish church the master or vicemaster in his absence shall weekly appoint one to note such as are absent from prayers who shall daily give their names to the master or in his absence to the vicemaster and if any without a sufficient cause to be allowed by the master or in his absence by the vicemaster be not present at prayers he or she shall for the first time forfeit one halfpenny for the second a penny and so for every time after for each month to be abated and defaulted from their allowance at the pay day happening next after such their default of these forfeitures one third part to be employed to the porter for that month and the other two to the common chest but in case any one without such cause as is aforesaid shall be found to have been absent seven times in one month he shall for the first time that he is found so offending forfeit all his allowance of the house for one fortnight and for the second time he or she shall have an admonition solemnly given them by the master and vicemaster which shall be entered into the ledger book but if after three such admonitions the same person shall be found again to have offended in the same kind he or she shall then for a negligent and incorrigible person be expelled from the hospital never to be received there again for why should any one who will not serve god be thought fit to be in this body after my departure out of this world i appoint that a commemoration or thanksgiving should be said at prayer time daily in the chapel for me as the founder of this hospital and for sir nicholas kempe knt who was a benefactor to this house the substance of this commemoration to be that they thank god for raising up unto them such a founder and benefactor and do pray god that they use aright such benefits as by their means have been and are bestowed upon them the following is a copy of the thanksgiving  most gracious god we yield thee all humble and hearty thanks for all these fatherly mercies and outward comforts thou have prepared for us particularly that it has pleased thee to move the heart of the most reverend father in god george abbot late lord archbishop of canterbury who for the worship and service of god and the relief and comfort of the poor founded and erected this hospital and also we thank thee for raising up sir nicholas kempe knt that in his lifetime and at his death was to this house a worthy benefactor grant o lord that we may spend and use these thy mercies aght to thy  and glory and that others by their good examples may be  up to works of charity and that both they and we may  attain everlasting life through jesus christ our  lord and savior     chap viii of honest conversation next after the service of god an honest and quiet godly conversation is to be looked unto it being the rule of the apostles that christians should live godly and justly and soberly in this present world i do therefore wish that the brethren and sisters of this hospital should live peaceably and quietly together as having one heart and one mind avoiding faction or bandying or siding one against another but studying to cherish help and comfort each other especially in time of sickness striving with all goodness and humbleness to bear one anothers burden i would have them by no means to be haunters of alehouses or taverns for that ministers occasion of drunkenness which is a vice odious to god and good men apt to bring on all kind of sin and has all the days of my life been hateful unto me  chap ix what crimes are to be avoided and upon what penalties if any brother or sister shall be convinced of any kind of incontinency perjury forgery obstinacy in heresy sorcery or any sort of charming or witchcraft or of any crime punishable by loss of life or limb or ear or shall be publicly set on the pillory or whipped for any offense by them committed or shall obstinately refuse to frequent divine service by law established upon confession or conviction hereof before the mayor of guildford the master of the hospital and the school master of the free school such brother or sister shall immediately by them be displaced and expelled out of the house and shall never be received thither again and if any brother or sister shall be a blasphemer of gods holy name an ordinary swearer a gamester at unlawful games a drunkard or hunter of taverns or alehouses a brawler fighter contentious person scold or sower of discord and thereof shall be convicted by confession or honest proof before the master of the hospital the vice master and parson of trinity church in guildford or any two of them such offender shall for the first time have a solemn admonition given him or her to be entered into the ledger book for the second time shall forfeit all allowance and commodity for one month to the common chest and shall have another solemn admonition as before and if he or she offend in the like a third time that person shall be expelled the house for ever by those three or two of them which are last beforementioned  chap x of residence within the hospital the eye of the governor does best direct thse things that are under his charge and therefore it is fit that the master of the hospital be present continually if it may be but because necessary business may call him sometimes away i allow unto him for his own affairs if he have cause two months in the year to be taken jointly or severally at his discretion so that always when he goes to lie two nights out of town he do enter it into the ledger book when he is abroad in business of the hospital either for lawsuits or to visit the possessions of the hospital i account him not absent if his private necessities enforce his absence for more than two months if he shall before the greater part of the brethren at home show a reasonable cause which shall be approved by them first and then by the mayor of guildford i give unto him one month more to be registered in the ledger book but beyond this none shall have further power save the archbishop of canterbury for the time being whom i beseech to be moderate herein and so to provide that by the absence of the master the hospital be not suffered in any sort to run into dilapidations of building or estate to each brother and sister i allow the space of two months absence in the year if they have cause to use it jointly or dividedly but so that they ask leave of the master or in his absence of the vicemaster whom i would not have to be difficult in granting them leave the time of their going forth shall be recorded in the ledger book and to the end that the members of this house may not be much flirting abroad but remaining at home as is fit for aged folks i appoint that no brother or sister being absent for any whole week from the hospital shall have any more than half their weekly allowance and this not to be neither unless the master and vicemaster do give approbation thereunto the master brethren and sisters are not to lodge any where in guildford but in the hospital and if any brother or sister without a sufficient cause to be allowed by the master or in his absence by the vicemaster shall lodge out of the house for the first time he or she shall forfeit twopence for the second time fourpence for the third time eightpence for the fourth time two shillings and sixpence and for the fifth time the whole next months allowance these forfeitures to be to the common chest for the sixth time such is to have a solemn admonition to be entered in the ledger book for the seventh offense in any one year which shall be counted to begin at the feast of st michael another admonition is to be given and entered but if within the same year he do transgress again he or she shall then by the master and vicemaster be expelled the hospital for that party who has so much mind to be out of the house why should he be troubled so far as to be kept in it  chap xi that no strangers lie within the hospital as on the one side i have been careful that those os this society should lodge within the house so my desire is as great that such as are strangers should not lie within the hospital i have provided that no married persons be of this body but experienced in other places has taught me that fathers and mothers are not unwilling to draw their children and kinsfolk unto them which will be both a burden and disturbance to the house and so will the receiving of other strangers be besides the disorders that cannot be foreseen i do therefore ordain that no person whatsoever shall be lodged in the hospital or continue there one whole night saving the master and the brethren and sisters except they be necessary servants of the house only i allow the master or in his absence the vicemaster in extremity of sickness and not otherwise to give leave to any brother or sister to have one person of their kindred or otherwise to watch with them besides the help that they shall have from the rest of this society but if any brother or sister do openly or secretly suffer any person to lie or continue all the night in their chambers or any other place in the hospital and be thereof convicted he or she shall for the first time forfeit the whole allowance of a month to the common chest and for the second time the benefit that should come to him or her for a quarter of a year to be to the common chest as before both these to be entered with an admonition into the ledger book but the party that the third time transgresses in this kind and is convicted thereof before the master vicemaster and parson of trinity church shall be by them for ever expelled out of the said hospital and herein i require them to be strict and severe to the master of the hospital i give leave to entertain a servant or two for his necessary uses but such as he will be answerable for to the society and because the lodgings provided for him has convenient rooms and sometimes there may be extraordinary concourse to the town as when the court lies near or at the time of the assize or in some other cases which cannot be foreseen i do permit unto him to lodge either his friend or some other person or persons of quality so that it may not be longer than for four or five nights and the same liberty i allow to be used to my brother sir morris abbot knt or to any of his children or childrens children if they should have occasion to see guildford provided always that none of these bring any detriment or expense to the hospital  chap xii care to be taken for those that be sick it cannot be conceived but where aged people are some are like diverse times to be sick who are then to be attended and comforted for in health each one can take care for himself but in sickness he must be helped by others for the better performance of this i appoint first that all the sisters shall from time to time be careful over the sick as themselves would wish to be helped by others in their extremities where they are to remember that as natural sisters are loving to their brothers and sisters especially in time of necessity so i would have these be kind each to other whom i as a common father have incorporated into this society and secondly i ordain that early the morrow after michaelmas day the master shall appoint especially two of the sisters whom he thinks to be most fit for that purpose to take upon them this particular charge and christian duty these shall be called the relievers of the impotent and when they have well and carefully performed that charge at the end of the year they shall have six shillings and eightpence a piece out of the common chest as an augmentation of their allowance but if any so appointed by the master shall refuse to take that charge upon them the party so refusing shall be debarred from receiving any allowance whatsoever for that year and that which is saved from her shall be put into the common chest of the hospital  chap xiii of the porter and his office there will be a necessity of having a porter to keep the gates of the house when the rest are gone to the parish church or otherwise to a sermon i do therefore ordain that the five junior brethren shall in their turns for the space of one month a piece supply this place the junior of all first beginning and so ending upwards and on the first day of every month the brother whose turn it is shall come unto the master or in his absence to the vicemaster to receive his charge for that place his office shall be to ring a bell twice each morning and evening unto prayers the second ringing to be one quarter after the first he shall also in the summer between the annunciation and michaelmas receive the keys of the gates from the master or vicemaster in the morning and open the fore gate at seven of the clock and shall shut it at eight of clock in the evening during that time and carry the keys to the master or in his absence to the vicemaster every night and from the feast of michaelmas to the annunciation he shall open the gates about eight oclock in the morning and shut them at seven oclock at night and then carry the keys to the master or in his absence to the vicemaster the backgate shall not be open but when there is especial use for carriage or otherwise and when that is finished it shall be presently shut again  chap xiv of the reparations of the hospital i have caufed this house to be substantially built and with gods blessing together with those who shall enjoy it at the fame time may continue long without great need of reparations if any thing be amiss in the main work i would have it presently amended least neglect at the first bring on further decay to this end i ordain that yearly on the monday next following the feast of st john baptist the master or vicemaster in his absence with hree other of the brethren whom he shall think apt for that purpose do discreetly view the house in all its buildings the cellars and leads together with the garden walls and the house near the garden and where they find cause that as soon as may be they see it repaired and if they see any tile fall off or any brick be notedly missing in the building or if any thing happen which can abide no delay for the mending although it be in the winter time i would have it repaired as soon as conveniently may be and all things so done in the public structure shall be at the expense of the hospital out of the common chest if in any private room of the hospital any glass window be broken or any other decay be by wilfulnefs or negligence that brother or sister whose the room is shall at his or her charge see it amended within the space of a month upon warning given by the master or vicemaster within which time if it be not done the person whose default it was shall for every week forfeit fourpence to go the common chest if the glass of any public room be broken it shall be enquired of who was the cause thereof and if it be found the party offending shall make it up again and if it cannot be discovered who it was it shall be repaired at the charge of the hospital but for the better preservation of all glass in the house i do utterly forbid the keeping of any dog within the hospital or precincts thereof upon pain to the party offending of forfeiting five shillings to the common chest for every day and in this i require the master and vicemaster upon their oaths to be very severe  chap xv of clean keeping of the public rooms it is a religious care that the house of god should be decently kept and it is a seemly sight that public places whereunto strangers may resort do lie no otherwise than cleanly i ordain therefore that on every saturday in the afternoon the chapel and hall be swept by one of the three junior sisters in their turns the latest coming into the house being first to begin and so to the next in order and if the garden yield herbs or flowers in the summer time they cannot be better employed than to adorn these rooms i do utterly forbid any swine or other noisome beasts to be kept within the precinct of the hospital or backside because my desire is that both comeliness and health shall be every where preserved  chap xvi in what worldly business the brothers and sisters may exercise themselves to the end that idleness may be avoided which is the mother of many sins i do not only permit that any brother or sister who has skill in any manual trade do work in the same either within the hospital or without to get some part of their living i do much commend them who shall employ themselves that way but ever with this caution that their laboring within the house be not offensive by any great noise ill savor or otherwise to the rest of the society i allow also that any brother or sister being able to exercise themselves in any honest labor of the body may perform the same abroad so that they lodge not out of the hospital without special leave of the master or in his absence of the vicemaster and that to be not above one night in the week i do forbid that any brother or sister should keep any alehouse or victualling house within the hospital or without upon pain of losing their place ipso facto it shall not be lawful for any member of this body by themselves or others to beg or crave of any person within this town or elsewhere if any be found so to do after two admonitions given by the master which by virtue of his oath after notice given i charge him to perform he or she shall forthwith be expelled by the master yet if any person shall without craving or asking voluntarily give any aims or benevolence it shall be lawful for those that are there present to receive it and to put it into the box prepared for that purpose that so when it comes to any quantity it may be divided among the brothers and sisters equally for i will not have the master to have any portion thereof there shall be two several locks and keys to the box the one to be kept by the master the other by the senior brother at home and once in the quarter it shall be opened in the presence of the most part of the society to be distributed among all provided always that if any thing be bestowed upon any particular person in respect of kindred sickness or any other impotency that wholly shall go to the party on whom it is particularly and specially bestowed  chap xvii of the house for the evidences and common seals i have built a strong room in the top of the tower over the gate and although it be within the masters lodgings yet would i have three keys to the door thereof the one to be kept by the master the other by the vicemaster and the third by the senior brother who is not vicemaster in this room i appoint things of moment which are not of daily use to be safely laid up and there shall be one chest with three several locks of sundry wards and fashions the keys whereof shall be kept by the three abovenamed in this chest shall be kept the common seal copies of the statutes and such stock of money as yearly remains after disbursements and is to be reserved for reparations and other necessary uses i ordain also that there be in the same room one other large chest wherein the foundation of the hospital shall be kept and all evidences of lands sorted fitly into several boxes which shall be superscribed with papers of direction according to the lands or parcels of the same there shall also be put all rentalls surveys terrars with buttails and bounds if any such be counterparts of leases courtrolls and yearly accounts and to this chest there shall also be three several locks and keys to be kept by the master or by the most ancient brother the second and third by one other of the brethren who from year to year the morrow after michaelmas day shall be chosen by the major part of the brethren of the hospital i ordain that no parcels of evidence shall at any time be taken from thence but upon especial cause and then also not to be longer kept from thence but as necessary occasion for the use thereof shall require there shall also remain in the said chest a paper book wherein shall be entered the parcels of all evidences from time to time taken forth the day and year when and to whose hands it was delivered and for how long a time as is to be presumed and the day and year also shall be entered when and by whom such parcel of evidence is delivered in again  chap xviii of the books and register of the hospital in such a room of the masters lodgings as i shall appoint there shall be a fair ledgerbook kept with lock and keys whereby the master and vicemaster shall be entered and registered the name age and qualities and times of admittance of every master brothers or sisters as also the times of the removings and deaths there shall also be one other fair ledger book wherein shall be entered the copies of all leases or other grants that be presently in use or hereafter shall be made by the said hospital and there shall be a third ledger book wherein shall be entered such things as are given to them of any moment and by whom and the inventory of all the movables and also all other matters that be of weight and may be fit by record to be continued to posterity but especially such admonitions as are given to offenders according to these statutes  chap xix how their lands shall be demised and with what covenants etc how their woods are to be kept and both woods and lands surveyed the lands or houses which i give to the hospital are intended by me to be for the good thereof and that in perpetuity if god be so pleased i do therefore in this chapter lay down such conditions as are fitting to be observed in their demise as first that no lease or any other grant shall be made of any lands tenements or hereditaments belonging to this hospital unless the master vicemaster and besides them the greater part of the brethren do yield their consents thereunto nor unless the full accustomed yearly rents thereof according as i do leave it be thereupon reserved and payable quarterly or at the least half yearly at or within the said hospital and such lease or grant shall not be above twenty and one years from the making of the same by the hospital and with reservation of all timber trees and in the same lease shall be contained the true and perfect parcels and quantities of land by common estimation with the buttalls and boundalls thereof if convenient it may be secondly there shall be in every such lease or grant a proviso contained that the farmer or tenant shall pay the rent at the hospital within twenty days next ensuing any one rent day limited for payment thereof without any demand to be made further in each lease or grant to be made covenants of this effect shall be first that the lessee at his own cost shall not only repair and if need be reedify all edifices thereupon and so well reedified and repaired shall leave them at the end of the term but shall also from time to time hedge fence ditch and scour the ground according to the usual courfe of husbandry of the country where the lands do lie secondly that the said lessees shall bear pay or discharge or save harmless the said hospital of and from all charges ordinary or extraordinary going out or to be paid by reason of the lands demised or of any parts thereof lastly that the lessees betwixt every eighth and ninth year of the said term shall make or cause to be made and written fair in parchment and delivered up to the master at the hospital a true and perfect terrier containing the name and quantity by estimation of every parcel of ground demised the manner of the situation and lying of the same toward other lands and the names of the present owners of the lands which are of any side abutting upon the ground demised i do ordain and appoint that the said hospital upon any reservation or otherwise shall not increase their rents or revenues of those lands i shall give unto them to any higher or greater proportion than as the rents thereof now are and according to that rent they are now let for unless it fall out that upon necessity which cannot be avoided some one of their farms do diminish in their rents which i ordain shall be moderately supplied by raising somewhat upon some other farm which may well bear it for i desire that my hospital shall keep up the rent wherewithal i do endow it but i do charge the conscience of the master and brethren that they be very wary and careful before they make any such alteration i do also ordain that in renewing and letting of leases the present farmers and tenants be always preferred doing reasonably for the benefit of the hospital as other men will do and amongst the rest i would have those especially favored who have their leases from myself or by my direction and also i do ordain and appoint that such money as they shall raise or make up on the fine of leases shall be divided into two parts the one moiety to be distributed between the master brethren and fisters equally saving that the master shall have a double portion of the other moiety to be put into the common treasury for the bearing of public burden as suits of law reparations or the like for the underwoods if they be not in my time leased out i would have to be cut in due season and yearly look what profit is made thereof that it should be accounted as part of their revenue and go to the common charges of the house but no timber trees to be sold but upon great necessity or apparent show of decay and the money arising thereof to be put into the common treasury not to be expended but upon great occasion  chap xx by whom the revenues of the hospital are to be received and disbursed the revenues and rents of the house shall be reserved in the hospital by the master vicemaster and the other clavigers or keykeepers and they shall give their acquittance for it if either of these places be void or any of them be out of town or so sick that they cannot be present at this receipt then in their stead shall be called the next two brothers in ancient that are able to stir abroad they taking unto them if neither of them can write some of the brethren that can write or some other honest person who is able to write and presently upon the receipt of the rent an entry shall be made thereof into the ledger book and then immediately shall the money be laid up in the common chest there to remain until there be occasion for payments to take it out again when any quarter is ended the next day if it be not sunday or if it be so then the next day following the clavigers or chestkeepers shall assemble in the masters lodgings and taking forth of the common chest so much money only as is to be distributed they shall pay unto each brother and sister their several due allowances a note of the receipt thereof being presently made in the ledgerbook and if any be sick or absent it shall be paid to such a brother as he or she shall make their attorney and then shall the master also receive his allowance if besides the quarterly wages or allowance there happen any occasion for disbursements of money otherwise as for reparations or suits of law or some such like thing this shall be inserted into the ledgerbook the day being named and the occasion and in whose presence and to whom twas delivered together with the hand or mark that received it  chap xxi of accounts to be made sor the whole year there is nothing that makes any corporation so to flourish as good husbandry and diligent looking to the state thereof and if i your founder in the course of my life had not been provident that way how should i have been able to build this house and endow it with possessions and therefore i do appoint that on the twentyninth day of october which was the day whereon i was born yearly the master vicemaster clavigers and two others of the brothers who are most ancient and be in no office or keykeepers shall meet together in the masters lodgings and there shall examine what rents or money of the common stock has been received that year as also what have been spent every way and if they have exceeded in any expense which

charge which is imposed upon him by these ordinances then upon notice thereof given to the lord archbishop of canterbury for the time being such punishment shall be inflicted upon him as the said lord

cause to use it and then if i do make use of it the master for the time being shall have his lodgings in the northwest part of the hospital yet that so to whom it appertains to go into the

the hospital i do reserve unto myself during my life power to abrogate add unto change or alter these ordinances and to place or displace any member thereof with cause or without cause to be rendered

of the good estate thereof as also of the poor members of the same the power of the archbishop shall be by himself or others whom he shall appoint to interpret any doubt arising out of the ordinances and statutes and to punish censure and remove any member thereof convicted according to these ordinances by me set down the said archbishop also from time to time shall have authority by himself or

whatsoever do not their duties according to these statutes that then the lord archbishop by himself or whom he please shall see it performed for which fatherly care i do not doubt but god will return many blessings upon him  chap xxvi of such allowances as are to be made by the master and members of this hospital the benefits that the master is to reap by the hospital shall be twenty pounds in money to be received at equal portions at the four quarters in the year the lodging assigned unto him a livery gown and a double portion of such dividend in money as is to arise by fines taken for renewing of leases when it shall fall out i appoint to every brother and sister two shillings and sixpence to be weekly paid to them their chamber and their livery besides such money as may arise by letting of leases hereafter and from the poor mens box and concerning gowns this i do ordain that once in two years against allhallowstide there be bought cloth good and strong of price about nine or ten shillings the london yard out of the which the master shall have the allowance fit for a large gown and each brother and sister so much as will make unto them a reasonable gown according to the tallness or stature of the party that is to wear it in these gowns they may go to the trinity church or other place where the sermon is to be the badges are to be accounted to belong to the hospital and must descend to those that come in from time to time and if any die his or her gown is to be left to the use of those who shall succeed that the hospital be not driven to buy liveries but at the time appointed notwithstanding when new gowns are bought and made it shall be at the will of every one to cut out their old or dispose of them at their pleasure the master is to take care of these things as also of buying seacoal or charcoal every year that may serve for the public use between allhallowstide and our lady day in lent if this be got in in the summertime it will be cheaper because the ways are fairer when the wood that i bought of bromfield shall be grown fit i appoint that such fuel as may be taken of it be used without spoil in the cutting and this will save some money which is otherwise to be laid out i do appoint that yearly on christmas day there be expended ten shillings amongst the company publicly in the hall in remembrance of the birth of our savior christ and the like sums on easter day as also upon whitsunday that the master brethren and sisters may with thanks to god lovingly rejoice together and i appoint other ten shillings to be bestowed upon the twentyninth day of october yearly in commemoration of the birthday of their founder  chap xxvii touching the manufacture to be set up in the procuring of my letters of mortmain one principal matter intended by me was to set up some manufacture in the town of guildford that young people might be set on work and that by trading that place might flourish as heretofore it has done i have taken order if god do bless it for lands of one hundred pounds by the year to be purchased for that purpose and when it be done i entreat the mayor of guildford and his brethren solemnly to meet once or more times in the year and to call unto them such wise and discreet persons as they shall think fit to advise whereupon this employment may best be fastened as or hempknitting of stockings or waistcoats or any other laudable trade that may be for the commonwealth of that corporation in particular and i do pray these persons which shall so meet to think upon orders to be set in writing for the digesting of the work and how once at least in the year there may be an account taken how this manufacture does prosper and what is from time to time to be altered added or amended in the project if god save my life i shall think upon the advancing and establishing of this my intendment which i do earnestly desire that a beginning may be given to the work for the erecting and continuing of this manufacture i do appoint the land at charlwood bought of one polesdon which is let for forty pounds yearly which rent i order to be applied only to that purpose and in like manner i appoint the lands at burstow bought of mr bishe and being rented at sixty pounds a year to be employed solely for this manufacture so that i do ordain this  00 l by the year shall not be mingled with any other money of my hospital but the rent thereof to be put into a chest by itself and all accounts appertaining thereunto to be kept and reserved by themselves i appoint that upon this chest be written and fastened in paper the chest for the manufacture and three locks and keys shall be thereunto which keys shall be kept by the master vicemaster or senior keykeeper and in this chest shall always be a great ledgerbook wherein shall be set down what money for the manufacture is received in and what is laid out and the account at the end of the year shall be there kept that it may be seen how the benefit by the trade increases or decreaseth i do not tie them that have the charge of this work to any one certain trade but give them power at the end of the year which i wish to be on the tenth or eleventh of november to alter it if they find reason for the same but appoint that such alteration shall not be but upon great deliberation and good grounds least by too much shifting all comes to nothing i do ordain that some discreet man who dwells in the town of guildford and writes a fair hand be chosen for a clerk to write down things necessary for the stablishing this work and for this i appoint him to have twenty shillings yearly at or upon the tenth of november and if the work do prosper it shall be in the power of the overseers for this work to better his pay so that it do not exceed twenty shillings more in any year  chap xxviii the proportion of the rent of the hospital and the allowances of them the mentioning of the clerks fee for the manufacture does put me in mind to set down an establishment of the revenues for my hospital and the expenses which must issue out of the same the lands then that i have endowed it withal the rents whereof i would never have increased or decreased if it may be are these the lands at merrow which was bought of mr goodwin by the year forty pounds the land at ewhurst bought of thomas hill by the year twentyseven pounds ten shillings the lands at horsham bought of constable by the year forty pounds the wood land bought of bromfield by the year twelve pounds ten shillings in the whole sum this amounts to by the year to two hundred pounds out of these receipts i do make this proportion of yearly allowances to the master of the hospital by the year twenty pounds to twenty poor brothers and sisters two shillings and sixpence a piece by the week which in the year amounts to one hundred and thirty pounds to the vicemaster yearly thirteen shillings and four pence to the two relievers of the impotent thirteen shillings and fourpence for four gaudy days forty shillings for the clerk to record things and for reading the statutes yearly twenty shillings to the parson of trinitychurch yearly thirty shillings the total of all which expense amounts to one hundred and fiftyfive pounds sixteen shillings and eightpence there remains then over and above yearly the sum of fortyfour pounds three shillings and fourpence which i ordain to this use that once in two years there should be bought sixty yards of cloth london measure to make new gowns for the master brothers and sisters which clothing may be strong good cloth and may arise in the whole to about thirty pounds whereof fifteen pound was saved the year before and fifteen pounds to be taken out of the rent of that year when the gowns were bought out of the rest of the surplusage of the revenue i appoint fuel to be bought yearly which is to be burnt in common for the relief of the poor brothers and sisters from allhallowtide to easter which may amount to about if any wood or coal be had toward this out of the lands bought of bromfield it may save so much money otherwise but i do order that the said lands of bromfield be so disposed of that it may yield rent or wood or coal to the proportion before set down by me that the hospital may honestly enjoy that which i have paid for when all these expenses are issued forth there will be a convenient surplusage remaining yearly for the stock of the house to bear lawsuits reparations or other public charge of the hospital which will be more increased by such money as will arise out of the quarters pay which is forborne upon the coming in of every brother and sister at the first and this stock i ordain to be so carefully kept for the public that if the master or any brother shall take out for any employment the value of one shilling or upwards upon any occasion or color i appoint that being convicted thereof before the archbishop of canterbury he shall presently by the said lord archbishop be expelled the house when this stock arises to one hundred pounds i would have that sum carefully kept in gold against time of extremity and none of it to be taken out without great cause and yet then upon the first opportunity to be made use of again because i hold it convenient that this my foundation should not be without one hundred pounds lying by against any great need which i hold fit to be kept as a secret of the house and not to be revealed by the master or any brother of the house to any stranger whatsoever the rest which is above this hundred pound is to be a running stock safely kept but upon necessary occasions money to be taken out for the public use of the hospital from time to time  chap xxix the explanation of a clause in the second chapter of these statutes twas in the year of our lord      that i first intended the building of this hospital and then minding the good of the town of guildford in laying down the persons that should be capable of places in my foundation i declared that such as were born or did dwell twenty years in guildford i would have guildford to be understood that alone which was under the government of the town and not otherwise wherein i did straiten the extent of the place twas not want of charity to others but to increase my favors to the inhabitants thereof in desiring that there should be provision for them and somewhat to spare if god were so pleased now since that time i had quite established my work i do hear that the mayor and his brethren have endeavored to enlarge their jurisdiction and have gone about to draw under their government some places adjoining as if they were hereafter to be members of that corporation and consequently capable of such benefits as may arise by the government of that town i will not dispute whether this endeavor be well or no for i have nothing to do with it but for avoiding of controversies in future times i do hereby declare that my settled purpose and meaning is that from henceforth i app t none to be capable of my hospital which was not born or lived in guildford the town of u ldford being taken as it was in the year    0 and not according to any addition that has been made since or may be hereafter whereafter if i should be dmanded a reason it were a sufficient answer to ask as it is in the gospel may i not do what i will with my own but i have many other causes and reasons to declare as i now do as first i keep myself to my first purpose and intention secondly twas the good of guildford old guildford as it was when i was born and my parents lived in it that i did seek which i did know would be greater to the poor of that place when it was kept restrained within itself and not communicated to any other thirdly it is well known that i was born in the parish of st nicholas in that town unto which parish are belonging many houses in and about katherinehill unto whom notwithstanding i did not enlarge my benevolence because they were not under the government of the mayor and my desire was and is to keep my charity within bounds that after my death things may go on quietly and there be no variance or controversy now if i have thus restrained the place where i was born it shall not be well if any other neighbors shall murmur thereat or be discontented therewithal i do therefore charge the master and brethren of the hospital that they never give way to any importunity that may or do cross this my explanation and declaration  these statutes were finished and delivered to be the ordinances whereby the hospital of the blessed trinity in guildford is to be governed  august         g cant

bishop of salisbury the life of bishop abbot this learned and humble man was born anno    0 and bred up under the same schoolmaster with his brother the archbishop till being sufficiently qualified for the university he was sent to baliol college in oxford anno       in      he took his master of arts degree became a noted preacher there also a constant lecturer at st martins church in the quadrivium and sometimes at abingdon in berkshire  his preferment was remarkably owing to his merit particularly in preaching notwithstanding the distinction which some have affected to make between the talents and tempers of these two brothers that george was the more plausible preacher robert the greater scholar george the abler statesman robert the deeper divine gravity did frown in george and smile in robert such the qualities of this robert evidently were that upon the first sermon he preached at worcester he was made lecturer in that city and soon after rector of all saints there and upon a sermon he preached at pauls cross he was presented to the rich benefice of bingham in nottinghamshire by one of his auditors john stanhope esquire and it is observed that as dew dropping on mowen grass refreshes it and makes it spring anew so his labors in his pastoral charge much refreshed the consciences of true converts which had felt the scythe of gods judgments and made them spring up in hope and newness of life again as dew distilling in silver drops mollifieth the parched ground so his heart melting into tears in many penitential exhortations mollified the stony hearts of those who had been before most obdurate in their sins and again as dew that falls from heaven returns not thither back again but enricheth the soil and makes fruitful the earth so his pains wheresoever he bestowed them were never steril but brought forth much fruit of comfort both to himself and of knowledge in the mysteries of salvation to his hearers  in      he became no less eminent for some of his writings particularly against a certain papist on the sacrament he then took his degrees in divinity that of doctor being completed in       in the beginning of the reign of king james i he he was made chaplain in ordinary to him and this king so well esteemed of his writings that with the second edition of dr abbots book e antichristo in   0  his majesty ordered his own commentary upon part of the apocalypse to be printed an honor which that king did to no other of the great clerks in this kingdom and in truth the doctors pen had now brought him also into general esteem for what he had hitherto published in defense of william perkinss reformed catholic against dr william bishop now a secular priest but afterward in the popes style a titular bishop of the aerial diocese of chalcedon it is asserted by dr featley in his life of abbot that he has herein given that william bishop as great an overthrow as jewel to harding bilson to allen or reynolds to heart at the end of this excellent work is added a particular treatise he soon after writ entitled the true ancient roman catholic which he dedicated to prince henry to whom it was so acceptable that he returned him many thanks in a letter written with his own hand and promised his assistance upon the next vacancy to advance him higher in the church and though by that princes untimely death the doctor lost some hopes yet in course of time his deserts found other friends to do him that justice  in   0  he was unanimously elected master of baliol college here it is observed of him that he was careful and skilful to set in this nursery the best plants and then took such care to water and prune them that in no plat or knot throughout the university of oxford there appeared more beautiful flowers or grew sweeter fruit than in baliol college while he was master his diligent reading to his scholars and his continual presence at public exercises both countenanced the readers and encouraged the hearers these regulations and improvements he further wrought by establishing piety which had been much neglected restoring peace which had been long wanted and making temperance more familiar among them which had been too great a stranger in that society  in may    0 we find him nominated by the king among the first fellows of his majestys royal college at chelsea then newly founded and designed as a kind of fortress for controversial divinity being thus as it were engarrisoned with the most able and select champions for the protestant cause against all assaults of popery and in november the same year he was made prebendary of normanton in the church of southwell  upon his preaching a sermon before the king during his month of waiting at court in      when the news of dr thomas hollands death was brought from oxford his majesty named him successor in the thealogical chair usually called the kings professor of divinity but he modestly refused the same till his brother procured a mandate from the king for him to hold it some notable circumstances we meet with of him in this station some notable circumstances etc in this station among the rest while he was professor in the chair at oxford was his preaching a sermon before the university in which he so significantly laid open the oblique methods then used by those who secretly favored popery to undermine the reformation and dr laud then present was so notoriously suspected to be one who used those methods as to have the said reflections applied by the whole auditory to him that in great vexation he wrote to his patron dr neal then bishop of lincoln therefore about the year      to know whether he should not make a direct reply to it the passage laud objected to was that abbot should say there were men who under pretense of truth and preaching against the puritans struck at the heart and root of that faith and religion now established among us which was the very practice of parsons and campians counsel when they came hither to seduce young students who afraid to be expelled if they should openly profess their conversion were directed to speak freely against the puritans as what would suffice so these do not expect to be accounted papists because they speak only against puritans but because they are indeed papists they speak nothing against them or if they do they beat about the bush and that softly too for fear of disquieting the birds that are in it hereupon laud in his letter to the said bishop of lincoln complains that he was fain to sit patiently at the rehearsal of this sermon though abused almost an hour together being pointed at as he fat yet would have taken no notice of it but that the whole university applied it to him and his friends told him he should sink in his credit if he answered not dr abbot in his own nevertheless he would be patient and desired his lordship to vouchsafe him some direction but as we hear not that laud did answer it the bishop might perhaps vouchsafe him rather directions to be quiet    and herein he has had the character given him of a profound divine most admirably well read in the fathers councils and schoolmen and a more moderate calvinian than either of his two predecessors in the divinitychair holland and humphrey were which he expressed by countenancing the sublapsarian way of predestination  lastly upon the kings perusal of his antilogia against the apology for garnet and the fame of his incomparable lectures in the university upon the kings supreme power against bellarmine and suarez printed after his death his majesty when the sea of salisbury fell void sent his conge d elire for him to the dean and chapter  thus as he set forward one foot in the temple of virtue his other still advanced in the temple of honor though indeed but leisurely which is imputed to his own humility the obstruction of his foes who traduced him for a puritan though cordial to the doctrine of the church of england and the unwillingness of some friends to adorn the church with the spoil of the university and mar a professor to make a bishop  he was consecrated by his own brother the archbishop on december        in his chapel at lambeth herein equalizing the felicity of seffridus some time bishop of chichester who being a bishop himself also saw his brother at the same time archbishop of canterbury  other bishoprics were voiced upon him but the business of the nullity beforementioned in his brothers life made a nullity for a time in his graces good intentions insomuch that king james when the doctor newly consecrated bishop of sarum came to do his homage said pleasantly to him abbot i have had very much to do to make thee a bishop but i know no reason for it unless it were because thou have written against one alluding to the name of the popish priest beforementioned  in his way to sarum he made a farewell oration at the university with great applause we have some fragments of it preserved in the original latin in hollandi her angl and featleys life of abbot and a translation thereof or epitome in english by lupton in his hist of modern protestant divines his brethren the heads of houses and other oxford friends parted with him on the edge of his diocese with tears for grief and the gentry of sarum received him with those of joy the next sabbathday following he offered his first fruits in the temple taking for his text the words of the psalmist      lord i have loved the habitation of thy house and the place where thine honor dwells  after he had verified the words of his text in the person of david his sermon ended he verified it in himself and made a demonstration that he loved that house of god not in tongue only and in word but in deed and verity for observing the beautiful old cathedral to be much decayed through negligence and the covetousness of those who filled their purses with that which should have stopped the chinks he used such means with the prebendaries as drew from them five hundred pounds which he applied to the reparation of the church and then labored to repair the congregation both by doctrine and discipline visiting his whole diocese in person and preaching every sabbath day whilst his health would permit either in the city or in the neighboring towns but this was not long for my author tells us that preaching on john    v    i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you for ever many of his hearers presaged his departure from them so indeed it proved his last and farewell sermon for soon after he came out of the pulpit he was seized with most dreadful fits of the stone in the kidneys which were brought on by that sedentary course he had accustomed himself to by his close application to study so that his hourglass contrary to others the sooner ran out by being stopped but in all the bodily tortures of his last fit his soul was at ease for the assurance of heavenly things caused him most cheerfully to part with earthly and the quick sense he had of the powers of the life to come deaded the sense of his bodily pains there were many came to visit him on his deathbed and among others the judges being then at sarum in their circuit to whom he spared not his christian admonitions and amongst many points he discoursed on before them insisted very much upon the benefit of a good confcience rendering many thanks to his creator for the great comforts he felt thereby now in his extremity and admonished all that heard him so to carry themselves in their most private and secret actions as well as in their public that they might obtain that at the last which would stand them in more stead than what all the world could afford besides having when death approached summoned his domestics and with broken speeches in the language of a dying man beginning to make a profession of his faith his friends persuaded him to refrain it being manifest in his writings he yielded to their advice and signed all his works with these words that faith which i have defended in my writings is the truth of god and in the avouching thereof i leave the world thus with exhortations benedictions and the pains of his disease quite worn out he lay as it were slumbering with now and then a short ejaculation and at length with eyes and hands uplifted for the space of two or three hours after some weeks continuance in that dreadful disorder he gave up the ghost on march the  d      in the fiftyeighth year of his age with these words come lord jesu come quickly finish in me the work that thou have begun into thy hands o lord i commend my spirit for thou have redeemed me o god of truth save me thy servant who hopes and confides in thee alone let thy mercy o lord he shown unto me in thee have i trusted o lord let me not be confounded for ever  he had not completely filled this see two years and three months being one of the five bishops which salisbury saw in six years and was buried over against the bishops seat in the cathedral dr featley who was his domestic chaplain tells us that he had so endeared himself to the inhabitants of salisbury by his diligence in his pastoral charge by his hospitality and bounty to the poor and lovely and lowly carriage even toward his inferiors that he was universally lamented  he had been twice married the last time with some displeasure to the archbishop about half a year after his promotion to the said see he left one son or more and also one daughter named martha who was married to sir nathaniel brent warden of meron college in oxford and their daughter margaret married dr edward corbet rector of haseley in oxfordshire who gave some of the bishops mss to the bodleian library as may appear in the article set apart for the enumeration of his writings enumeration of his

which dr howson opposed till king james turned his edge from geneva to rome and then he as fiercely declared against the pope that hod loosen him from his chair though he were fastened thereto with a tenpenny nail our author also left other sermons which he had preached at pauls cross and at worcester and some in latin at oxford etc lectures on st matthew examination of mr bishops reproof of his dedication etc to the answer of his epistle to the king preface to be inserted after the dedication of his book de antichristo besides commentaries on some parts of the old testament and a commentary in latin upon the whole epistle to the romans which is called an accurate work in large sermons upon every text wherein he has handled all the controverted points of religion and enclosed the whole magazine of his learning and it is regretted that the church should be deprived of such a treasure particularly that of worcester to which he seems to have bequeathed it in his epistle to the sermons
