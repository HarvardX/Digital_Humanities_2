have been omitted by that author  by john brand a b of lincoln college oxford  multiludo vulgi more magisquam judicio post alium alius quasi prudentiorem sequitur sallust ad caes somnia terrores

in no instance so clearly evinced her faithfulness as in the transmitting of vulgar rites and popular opinions  of these when we are desirous of tracing them backwards to their origin many lose themselves in antiquity  they have indeed traveled down to us through a long succession of years and the greatest part of them it is not improbable will be of perpetual observation for the generality of men look back with superstitious veneration on the ages of their forefathers and authorities that are gray with time seldom fail of commanding those filial honors claimed even by the appearance of hoary old age  many of these it must be confessed are mutilated and as in the remains of ancient statuary the parts of not a few of them have been awkwardly transposed they preserve however the principal traits that distinguished them in their origin  things composed of such flimsy materials as the fancies of a multitude do not seem calculated for a long dution yet have these survived shocks by which even empires have been overthrown and preserved at least some form and color of identity during a repetition of changes both in religious opinions and in the polity of states  but the strongest proof of their remote antiquity is that they have outlived the general knowledge of the very causes that gave rise to them  the reader will find in the subsequent pages an union of endeavors to rescue many of these causes from oblivion if on the investigation they appear to any so frivolous as not to have deserved the pains of the search the humble laborers will avoid censure by incurring contempt  how trivial soever such an enquiry may seem to some yet all must be informed that it is attended with no small share of difficulty and toil  a passage is to be forced through a wilderness intricate and entangled few vestiges of former labors can be found to direct us we must oftentimes trace a tedious retrospective course perhaps to return at last weary and unsatisfied from the making of researches fruitless as those of some ancient enthusiastic traveller who ranging the barren african sands had in vain attempted to investigate the hidden sources of the nile  rugged and narrow as this walk of study may seem to many yet fancy who shares with hope the pleasing office of brightening a passage through every route of human endeavor opens from hence too prospects enriched with the choicest beauties of her magic creation  the prime origin of the superstitious notions and ceremonies of the people is absolutely unattainable we despair of ever being able to reach the fountain head of streams which have been running and increasing from the beginning of time all that we aspire to do is only to trace backwards as far as possible the courses of them on those charts that remain of the distant countries from whence they were first perceived to flow  few who are desirous of investigating the popular notions and vulgar ceremonies in our nation can fail of deducing them in their first direction from the times when popery was our established religion  we shall not wonder that these were able to survive the reformation when we consider that though our sensible and spirited forefathers were upon conviction easily induced to forego religious tenets which had been weighed in the balance and sound wanting yet were the people by no means inclined to annihilate the seemingly innocent ceremonies of their former superstitious faith  these consecrated to the fancies of men by a usage from time immemorial though crazed by public authority from the written word were committed as a venerable deposit to the keeping of oral tradition like the penates of another troy recently destroyed they were religiously brought off after having been snatched out of the smoking ruins of popery  it is not improbable that in the infancy of protestantism the continuance of many of these was connived at by the state for men who are but children of a larger growth are not weaned all at once and the reformation of manners and of religion is always most surely established when effected by slow degrees and as it were imperceptible gradations  thus also at the first promulgation of christianity to the gentile nations through the force of conviction they yielded indeed to truth yet they could not be persuaded to relinquish many of their superstitions which rather than forego them altogether they chose to blend and incorporate with their new faith  christian or rather papal rome borrowed her rites notions and ceremonies in the most luxurious abundance from ancient and heathen rome and much the greater number of these flaunting externals which infallibility has adopted and used as feathers to adorn her triplecap have been stolen out of the wings of the dying eagle  with regard to the rites sports etc of the common people i am aware that the morose and bigoted part of mankind i shall quote here the subsequent curious thoughts on this subject the puritans are ridiculed in them  these teach that dancing is a jezabell and barleybreak the ready way to hell the morris idols whitsunales can be but profane relics of a jubilee these in a zeal to express how much they do the organs hate have silenced bagpipes too and harmless maypoles all are railed upon as if they were the towers of babylon randolphs poems      without distinguishing between the right use and the abuse of such entertainments cavil at and malign them yet must such be told that shows and sports have been countenanced by the best and wisest of states and though it cannot be denied that they have been sometimes prostituted to the purposes of riot and debauchery yet were we to reprobate every thing that has been thus abused religion itself could not be retained perhaps we should be able to keep nothing  the common people confined by daily labor seem to require their proper intervals of relaxation perhaps it is of the highest political utility to encourage innocent sports and games among them the revival of many of these would i think be highly pertinent at this particular season when the general spread of luxury and dissipation threatens more than at any preceding period to extinguish the character of our boasted national bravery for the observation of an honest old writer stow who tells us speaking of the maygames midsummereve i call to mind here the pleasing account mr stern has left us in his sentimental journey of the gracedance after supper  i agree with that amiable writer in thinking that religion may mix herself in the dance and that innocent cheerfulness is no inconsiderable part of devotion such indeed as cannot fail of being grateful to the good being  it is a silent but eloquent mode of praising him rejoicings etc anciently used in the streets of london which open pastimes in my youth being now suppressed worse practices within doors are to be seared may be with singular propriety adopted on the most transient survey of our present popular manners  mr bourne my predecessor in this walk has not from whatever cause done justice to the subject he undertook to treat of far from having the vanity to think that i have exhausted it the utmost of my pretensions is to the merit of having endeavored by making additions to improve it i think him however deserving of no small share of praise for his imperfect attempt for much is due to those who first broke the way to knowledge and left only to their successors the task of smoothing it  new lights have arisen since his time the english antique has become a general and fashionable study and the discoveries of the very respectable society of antiquaries have rendered the recesses of papal and heathen antiquities easier of access  i flatter myself i have turned all these circumstances in some measure to advantage i have gleaned passages that seemed to throw light upon the subject from a great variety of volumes and those written too in several languages in the doing of which if i shall not be found to having deserved the praise of judgment i must at least make pretensions to the merit of industry  elegance of composition will hardly be expected in a work of this kind which stands much less in need of attic wit than of roman perseverance and dutch assiduity  i shall offer some discoveries which are peculiarly my own for there are customs yet retained here in the north of which i am persuaded the learned of the southern part of the island have not heard which is perhaps the sole cause why they have never before been investigated  in perusing the subsequent observations the candid reader who has never before considered this neglected subject is requested not to be rash in passing sentence but to suspend his judgment at least till he has carefully examined all the evidence by which caution i do not wish to have it understood that our determinations are thought to be infallible or that every decision here is not amenable to an higher authority in the mean time prejudice may be forwarned and it will apologize for many seemingly trivial reasons assigned for the beginning and transmitting of this or that notion or ceremony to reflect that what may appear foolish to the enlightened understandings of men in the eighteenth century wore a very different aspect when viewed through the gloom that prevailed in the seventh or eighth  i should trespass upon the patience of my reader were i to enumerate all the books i have consulted on this occasion to which however i shall take care in their proper places to refer but i own myself under particular obligations to durands ritual of divine offices a work inimical to every idea of rational worship but to the enquirer into the origin of our popular ceremonies an invaluable magazine of the most interesting intelligence i would style this performance the great ceremonial law of the romanists in comparison with which the mosaic code is barren of rites and ceremonies we stand amazed on perusing it at the enormous weight of a new yoke which holy church fabricating with her own hands has imposed on her servile devotees  yet the forgers of these shackles had artfully contrived to make them sit easy by twisting flowers around them dark as this picture drawn by the pencil of gloomy superstition appeared upon the whole yet was its deep shade contrasted with pleasing lights  the calendar was crowded with redletter days nominally indeed consecrated to saints but which by the encouragement of idleness and dissipation of manners gave every kind of countenance to sinners  a profusion of childish rites pageants and ceremonies diverted the attention of the people from the consideration of their real state and kept them in humor if it did not sometimes make them in love with their slavish modes of worship  to the credit of our sensible and manly forefathers they were among the first who felt the weight of this new and unnecessary yoke and had spirit enough to throw it off  i have fortunately in my possession one of those ancient romish calendars of singular curiosity which contains under the immovable feasts and fasts i regret much its silence on the moveable ones a variety of brief observations contributing not a little to the elucidation of many of our popular customs and proving them to have been sent over from rome with bulls indulgencies and other baubles bartered as it should seem for our peter pence by those who trafficked in spiritual merchandise from the continent  these i shall carefully translate though in some places it is extremely difficult to render the very barbarous latin of which i fear the critic will think i have transfused the barbarity brevity and obscurity into my own english and lay before my reader who will at once see and acknowledge their utility  a learned performance by a doctor moresin in the time of james i and dedicated to that monarch is also luckily in my possession it is written in latin and entitled the origin and increase of depravity in religion containing a very masterly parallel between the rites notions etc of heathen and those of papal rome  the copious extracts from this work with which i shall adorn the subsequent pages will be their own eulogy and supersede my poor encomiums  when i call to remembrance the poet of the late mr gray humanity who has transmitted his name to immortality by reflections written among the little tombstones of the vulgar in a country churchyard i am urged by no false shame to apologize for the seeming unimportance of my subject  the antiquities of the common people cannot be studied without acquiring some useful knowledge of mankind by the chemical process of philosophy even wisdom may be extracted from the follies and superstitions of our forefathers  the people of whom society is chiefly composed and for whose good superiority of rank is only a grant made originally by mutual concession is a respectable subject to every one who is the friend of man  pride which independent of the idea arising from the necessity of civil polity has portioned out the human genus into such a variety of different and subordinate species must be compelled to own that the lowest of these derives itself from an origin common to it with the highest of the kind the beautiful sentiment of terence  homo sum humani nihil a me alienum puto may be adopted therefore in this place to persuade us that nothing can be foreign to our enquiry which concerns the smallest of the vulgar of those little ones who occupy the lowest place in the political arrangement of human beings  j b westgatestreet newcastle nov         n b here follow mr bournes title page dedication and preface antiquitates vulgares or the antiquities of the common people giving

know none so justly entitled to the effects and produce of study as those who are the promoters and patrons of learning they undoubtedly of all others have the best of claims to a work of this nature whose generosity and benevolence have been conspicuous in so promoting the welfare of their country and the good of mankind  and such gentlemen are you the incouragers of learning and the rewarders of merit there are numbers to witness the one and your clergy may witness the other  for not to mention you in your private capacities as promoters of common learning as the helpers and supporters of schools of charity one great blessing of your community you in your public stations uphold a nobler literature and assist a more generous education you not only lay the groundworks here but you help to the top of arts and sciences in the greater schools of learning  nor is it less certain that you have always been eminent and that not only in your own country but in distant parts for the support of an orthodox and learned clergy your fame for maintaining them and your regard to merit in choosing them being every where spoken of  justly therefore are you entitled to performances of this nature

and by all the ties of gratitude to lay the first fruits of my labors at your feet hoping that as you have been very instrumental in occasioning them so you will receive them under your care and

that honor but as they are an indication of the sincerest thankfulness and gratitude of  gentlemen your most obliged most obedient and most humble servant henry bourne  the preface the following sheets are a few of that vast number of ceremonies and opinions which are held by the common people such as they solely or generally observe for though some of them have been of national and others perhaps of universal observance yet at present they would have little or no being if not observed among the vulgar  i would not be thought a reviver of old rites and ceremonies to the burdening of the people nor an abolisher of innocent customs which are their pleasures and recreations i aim at nothing but a regulation of those which are in being amongst them which they themselves are far from thinking burdensome and abolishing such only as are sinful and wicked  some of the customs they hold have been originally good though at present they retain little of their primitive purity the true meaning and design of them being either lost or very much in the dark through folly and superstition to wipe off therefore the dust they have contracted to clear them of superstition and make known their end and design may turn to some account and be of advantage whereas observing them in the present way is not only of no advantage but of very great detriment  others they hold are really sinful notwithstanding in outward appearance they seem very harmless being a scandal to religion and an encouraging of wickedness and therefore to aim at abolishing these will i hope be no crime though they be the diversions of the people  as to the opinions they hold they are almost all superstitious being generally either the produce of heathenism or the inventions of indolent monks who having nothing else to do were the forgers of many silly and wicked opinions to keep the world in awe and ignorance and indeed the ignorant part of the world is so still awed that they follow the idle traditions of the one more than the word of god and have more dependence upon the lucky omens of the other than his providence more dread of their unlucky ones than his wrath and punishment  the regulating

its antiquity the reason of its institution the benefit and advantage of it an exhortation to the use of it according to its first institution the ceremony of tolling the bell at the time of death seems to be as ancient as the having of bells themselves we are told binghams orig eccl lib   it was about the seventh century when bells were first in the church and that venerable bede is the first that mentions them if this be true then it is as true that the tolling of the bell was instituted about that time for where our countryman mentions the word campana or bell there it also is that we find a bell made use of for the dead haec tunc in dormitorio sororum pausans exaudivit subito in aere notum campanae sonum quo ad orationes excitari vel convocari solebant cum quis eorum de seculo fuisset evocatus bed eccl hist lib   cap    for at the death of the abbess st hilda he tells us that one of the sisters of a distant monastery as she was sleeping thought she heard the wellknown sound of that bell which called them to prayers when any of them had departed this life but be that as it will it is evident that the bell was tolled upon this occasion about bedes time and consequently that the ceremony is as ancient as his days  the reason why this custom was instituted was not as some seem to imagine for no other end than to acquaint the neighborhood that such a person was dead but chiefly that whoever heard the noise of the bell should put up their prayers for the soul thus the father abovementioned tells us again quod cum illa audisset suscitavit cunctas sorores and in ecclesiam convocatas orationibus and psalmis pro anima matris operam dare monuit ibid that she who presided in this monastery had no sooner heard this than she raised all the sisters and called them into the church where she exhorted them to pray fervently and sing a requiem for the soul of their mother cassalion also upon this place of bid says that et talis ritus etiam de praesenti servatur in anglia ut cum quis decessit statim campana propriae illius parochiae speciali quodam modo sonat per aliquod temporis spatium  quamvis angli negent modo orationes and suffragia defunctis proficua non aliam tamen in hoc ab illis rationem potui percipere quam quod talis sonus sit ritus antiquae ecclesiae anglicanae cassali de vet sac christ rit p     the same custom is still observed in england that as soon as any has departed this life the bell belonging to the parish he lived in was immediately tolled and for some time  and though says he the english now deny that prayers are of any service to the dead yet i could meet with no other account of this ceremony than that it was a custom of the old church of england  and for this reason it is that this custom was first observed and should be still retained among us viz that the prayers of the faithful may be assisting to the soul and certainly it might be more profitably retained were it so ordered that the bell should be tolled before the persons departure as was undoubtedly designed when this ceremony was continued that good men might give him their prayers was this always so observed there might be some moses amongst the number of the faithful whose prayers could prevail upon god to beat back the amalekites of darkness some whose faith might remove a mountain of sins and some whose tears procure a multitude of mercies o the comfort of the forgiveness of sins of being guided safely through the shadow of death of arriving securely at the heavenly country what is it that prayer cannot obtain  but though the wickedness and impenitency of the dying person be such as that the prayers of the faithful will not be sufficient to avert the wrath and punishment of a justly incensed god yet as this can be only known to god it will not discharge men from recommending him to the divine mercy in the most passionate and affectionate manner they thereby express the most laudable zeal the most disinterested charity and whilst they are so solicitous for the happiness and welfare of other mens souls they cannot but be thereby influenced to have the greatest concern for their own and be both encouraged and directed to proceed with an holy emulation from strength to strength and endeavor as the heb vi   apostle advises to go on to perfection  but alas we are fallen into times of such irreligion and prejudice such contempt of antiquity and such too great reformation that what with indolence on one hand and ignorance on the other what with no zeal on this side and too among the many objections of the brownists it is laid to the charge of the church of england that though we deny the doctrine of purgatory and teach the contrary yet how well our practice suits with it may be considered in our ringing of hallowed bells for the soul bish hall cont brown false a one on that we either neglect the most decent ceremonies of religion or we think it is religion to have no ceremonies at all no wonder then that in the midst of such a crooked and perverse generation when the most of men are negligent of themselves they are also negligent of others no wonder that when there is such a general contempt of religion and men are careless of their own souls they are not careful for the souls of their friends  but it is called in a vestrybook belonging to the chapel of all saints in newcastle upon tyne it is observable that the tolling of the bell is not mentioned in the parish accounts from the year      till      when we find it ordered to be tolled again at a vestry holden january   st      whereas for some years past the collecting of the duty for bell and tolling has been forborne and laid aside which has much lessened the revenue of the church by which and suchlike means it is brought into dilapidations and having now taken the same into serious consideration and fully debated the objections made by some against the same and having had the judgment of our ministers concerning any superstition that might be in it which being made clear it is this day ordered that from henceforth the church officer appointed thereunto do collect the same and bring the money unto the churchwardens and that those who desire to have the use of the bells may freely have them as formerly paying the accustomed fees it is certain they laid it aside because they thought it superstitious and it is probable if they had not wanted money they had not seen the contrary popish and superstitious for what true reason i know not did we indeed imagine with the papists that there is any we call them soulbells for that they signify the departure of the soul not for that they help the passage of the soul bish hall cont brown p     virtue or extraordinary power in a bell that it is item ut daemones tinnitu campanarum christianos ad preces concitantium terreantur formula vero baptizandi seu benedicendi campanas antiqua est durant lib c    s   hallowed by baptism and drives away the spirits of darkness then it might justly be called superstition and therefore justly abolished but when we retain the custom only to procure the prayers of the faithful for a departing soul it would surely be of advantage to observe it if the prayers of a righteous man avail any thing at all which if we may believe an inspired apostle are of very great efficacy and validity  art thou then attending a friend in his last moments art thou careful for his soul and solicitous for his salvation do thou wish him safe through the valley of death to the everlasting hills would thou have the good angels protect him and be his shield against the powers of darkness in short would thou have him crowned with the joys of paradise be assured then that the prayers of good men will very much contribute to the gaining of these things but how shall they then pray for him if they know not of his departure and how can they know that without the tolling of the bell do thou therefore put in practice this decent and profitable custom not as our age generally does after the death of thy friend but before it before he leave the world when the prayers of good men can assist him and facilitate his journey into the other life  or art thou working in the field or grinding at the mill remember then when thou hear the sound of the bell for one departing that thou put up thy prayers for him be thy business what it will it will always permit thee to say at least lord now let thou thy servant depart in peace or to use the words of st oswald when he and his soldiers were ready to be slain lord have mercy on the soul of thy oravit ad dominum pro animabus exercitus sui unde dicunt in proverbio deus miserere animabus dixit oswaldus cadens in terram bed eccl l   c    it is used says bid even to a proverb that he died praying for when the enemy had surrounded him and he saw himself about to be slain he prayed unto the lord for the souls of his army hence it is that the proverb comes lord have mercy upon the soul as st oswald said when he fell to the earth which proverb in all probability has been the original of this present national saying when the bell begins to toll lord have mercy on the soul  servant it will not be long till thou thyself shall have occasion for such prayers till thou come to die and enter on thy journey to the other state if then thou have been merciful thou shall obtain mercy if by thy prayers thou have assisted the souls of thy brethren thou shall either be remembered in the prayers of good men or surely these thy prayers for others will be of service to thyself also at that dreadful hour  but now it may be objected that as the bell is seldom tolled till after the persons departure it is to no purpose to pray for the soul nay to pray for it would be praying for the dead and since that is repugnant to the doctrine of our church our prayers at that time had much better be omitted  indeed it is too true this custom is not so common as it should be but however it is so much observed as will be able to vindicate the putting up of constant prayers i know several religious families in this place and i hope it is so in other places too who always observe it whenever the melancholy season offers and therefore it will at least sometimes happen when we put up our prayers constantly at the tolling of the bell that we shall pray for a soul departing and though it be granted that it will oftener happen otherwise as the regular custom is so little followed yet that can be no harmful praying for the dead we believe that the soul is but departing and it is charitably done to offer up our prayers and therefore when it proves otherwise our psalm xxxiv    prayer shall turn into our own bosom and like as that peace which the disciples wished to an unworthy house returned to the disciples again so though our prayers at that time may be of no service to the soul yet they will be of no disservice to us they will return to us again but it will be no fault to have misplaced them  prayers upon this occasion from bishop tailor i o holy and most gracious jesu we humbly recommend the soul of thy servant into thy hands thy most merciful hands let thy blessed angels stand in ministry about thy servant and defend him from the violence and malice of all his ghostly enemies and drive far from him all the spirits of darkness amen  ii lord receive the soul of this thy servant enter not into judgment with him spare him whom thou have redeemed with thy most precious blood and deliver him for whose sake thou did suffer death from all evil and mischief from the crafts and assaults of the devil from the fear of death and from everlasting death amen  iii lord impute not unto him the follies of his youth nor any of the errors and miscarriages of his life but strengthen him in his agony and carry him safely through his last distress let not his faith waver nor his hope fail nor his charity be disordered let him die in peace and rest in hope and rise in glory amen  iv lord we know and believe assuredly that whatsoever is under thy custody cannot be taken out of thy hands nor by all the violences of hell robbed of thy protection preserve the work of thy hands rescue him from all evil and let his portion be with the patriarchs and prophets with the apostles and martyrs and all thy holy saints in the arms of christ in the bosom of felicity and in the kingdom of god for ever amen  v o savior of the world who by thy cross and precious blood have redeemed us save and help this thy departing servant we beseech thee o lord amen  vi o almighty lord who art a most strong tower to all them that put their trust in thee to whom all things in heaven in earth and under the earth do bow and obey be now and evermore his defense and make him to know and feel by a powerful sense of thy goodness that there is no other name under heaven given to man in whom and through whom we may receive health and salvation but only the name of our lord jesus christ amen  vii o lord unto thy gracious mercy and protection we commit him o god the father bless him and keep him o god the son make thy face to shine upon him and be gracious unto him o god the holy ghost lift up thy countenance upon him and give him thy peace both now and evermore amen  observations on chapter i our author seems of opinion that the ceremony of tolling a bell the subsequent etymology of this word has the sanction of the learned sir henry spelman bell is derived from pelvis a basin for before the invention of bells not only sounding brass but basins also were used instead of them housewives to this day try the soundness of their earthen or china vases by ringing them with a finger vide lyes junii etymolog in verbo  mr wheatley in his illustration of the liturgy apologizes for our retaining this ceremony our church says he in imitation of the saints in former ages calls in the minister and others who are at hand to assist their brother in his last extremity in order to this she directs that when any one is passing out of this life a bell should be tolled etc it is called from thence the passing bell at the time of death is as ancient as the use of bells this is somewhat improbable it has rather been an afterinvention of superstition thus praying for the dying was improved upon into praying for the dead bells must have been first used as signals to convene the people

reasons he assigns for these numbers are too contemptible for translation if for a clergyman as many times as he had orders and at the conclusion a peal on all the bells to distinguish the quality of the person for whom the people are to put up their prayers a bell too must be rung while we are conducting the corpse to church and during the bringing it out of the church to the grave i think this a curious and pertinent quotation it seems to account for a custom still preserved in the north of making numeral distinctions at the conclusion of this ceremony  nine knells for a man six for a woman and three for a child which are without doubt the vestiges of this ancient injunction of popery  the quotation our author gives us from bid i have examined this passage in king alfreds saxon version of bid in rendering campana i find he has used cluggan which properly signifies a clock bellan is in the margin clock is the old german name for a bell and hence the french call one une cloche there were no clocks in england in alfreds time he is said to have measured his time by wax candles marked with circular lines to distinguish the hours  i would infer from this that our clocks have

churches in the year     a gross mistake and into which our honest historian must have been led by his misunderstanding the word cloca a latin term coined from the old german name for a bell for clocks therefore read bells is very apposite as is that from cassalions occasional comment the latter however appears to no great advantage as an antiquary when he tells us he could meet with no other account of this ceremony than that it was a custom of the old church of england the passage above cited from durand would have informed him from whence it must have been imported into this kingdom  it

dispel pestilence and grace festivals     i have not been able to ascertain precisely the date of this useful invention the ancients had some sort of bells i find the word tintinnabula which we usually render bells in martial juvenal and suetonius the romans were summoned by these of whatever size or form they were to their hot baths and to the business of public places  the large kind of bells now in use are said to have been invented by paulinus bishop of nola in campania whence the latin name campana about the year  00 spelmans gloss verb campana trusters chronology  and to have

the greek church under them still follow their old custom of using wooden boards or iron plates full of holes which they hold in their hands and knock with a hammer or mallet to call the people together to church see dr smiths account of the greek church he was an eyewitness of this remarkable custom which durand tells us is retained in the romish church on the three last days of the week preceding easter durandi rational p        bingham informs us of an invention before bells for convening religious assemblies in monasteries it was going by turns to every ones cell and with the knock of a hammer calling the monks to church the instrument was called the nightsignal and the wakening mallet  in many of the colleges at oxford the bible clerk knocks at every room door with a key to waken the students in the morning before he begins to ring the chapel bell  a vestige it should seem of the ancient monastic custom    china has been remarkably famous for its bells  father le compte

ecclesiastical uses they have also with great propriety been adapted to civil purposes  the tolling of the great bell of st nicholas church here is an ancient signal for our burgesses to convene on

first year of his reign commanded that in every town and village a bell should be rung every night at eight oclock and that all people should then put out their fire and candle and go to bed the ringing of this bell was called in french curfew i e coverfire ibid at eight in the evening  our bells are muffled on the  0th of january for which i find no precedent of antiquity their sound on that

the tolling the great bell of each church on this occasion  with us too as durand orders above a bell is tolled and sometimes chimes are rung a little before the burial and while they are conducting the corpse to church they chime or ring too in some places while the grave is filling up  there seems to be nothing intended by tolling the passing bell at present but to inform the neighborhood of any persons death and i am much mistaken if our authors mr bourne complains in his preface of the invidious behavior of some of his townsmen  it is beneath a man conscious of inward worth to complain of that which he ought always to despise  posterity seems to have done him very ample justice for their insults  a copy of the antiquitates vulgares has of late fetched seven or eight shillings in london  many perhaps will think the purchasers mistook an accident for merit and confounded the idea of scarceness with that of intrinsic value  i received this information from one of the society of antiquaries who understands the subject too well himself to be mistaken in his opinion of the merit of those who have written upon it on the weight of that opinion alone i have been induced to preserve every line that our author has left us in that work very pious exhortation will ever be able to revive the primitive use of it  i know not how the present generation will relish his

where practiced they were wont to sit by it from the time of its death till its exportation to the grave either in the house it died in or in the church itself agreeable to this we read in st austin that as they watched his mother monica psalterium arripuit fuodius and cantare caepit psalmum cui respondebamus omnes domus miserecordiam and judicium cantabo tibi domine aug lib   confess c    euodius took the psalter and began to sing a psalm which the whole family answered with that of the psalmist david i will sing of mercy and judgment unto thee o lord will i sing and we are told ad ecclesiam antelucana hora qua defunctus est corpus ipsius portatum est ibique eadem fuit nocte quam vigilavimus in pascha greg turon de gloria confess c  0  that at the death of st ambrose his body was carried into the church before day the same hour he died it was the night before easter and they watched with him there  how unlike to this ancient custom of watching is the modern one of locking up the corpse in a room and leaving it there alone how unlike to this decent manner of watching is that watching of the vulgar which is a scene of sport and drinking and lewdness watching at that time with a dear friend is the last kindness and respect we can show him and how unfriendly is it to change it into negligence and too great resignation how unchristian instead of a becoming sorrow and decent gravity to put on an unbecoming joy and undecent pastime  observations on chapter ii our author for what reason i know not has omitted the vulgar name given here to this watching with a corpse it is called the lakewake a word plainly derived from the anglosaxon lic or lice a corpse and waecce a wake vigil or watching it is used in this sense by chaucer in his knights tale  shall not be told for me how that arcite is brent to ashen cold ne how that there the lichewake was yhold all that night long thus also i read in the article walkin in the learned by the late mr ruddiman as is generally supposed glossary to douglas virgil properly likewakes scotch are the meetings of the friends of the deceased a night or nights before the burial  i am not satisfied with either of the quotations he has given us in proof of the antiquity of the custom they are indeed something to the purpose but in the last cited passage one would be inclined to think from the words of the original that the watching was on account of its being the vigil of easter day  the subsequent extract from one of the ancient councils quoted in durant porro observandum est nedum psalmos cani consuetum cum funus ducitur sed etiam nocte quoe praecedit funus veteres vigilasse nocturnasque vigilias canendis psalmis egisse p     is i think much more apposite  now it must be observed that psalms are wont to be sung not only when the corpse is conducted to church but that the ancients watched on the night before the burial and spent the vigil in singing psalms so also gregory in the epistle that treats of the death of his sister macrina has these words cum igitur inquit nocturna pervigilatio ut in martyrum celebritate canendis psalmis perfecta esset and crepusculum advenisset etc durant p     now when the nightly watching as is usual etc  i could give numerous passages from the ancients were there any doubt of the antiquity of a custom which probably owes its origin to the tenderest affections of human nature and has perhaps on that account been used from the infancy of time  i find in durant a pretty exact account of some of the ceremonies used at present in what we call laying out or streeking to streek to expand or stretch out from the anglosaxon strecan extendere see bensons anglosaxon vocabulary in verbo  a streekingboard is that on which they stretch out and compose the limbs of the dead body in the north quinetiam sanctorum corpora manibus erectis supinisque excipere  occludere oculos  ora obturare  decenter ornare  lavare accurate and linteo funebri involvere etc  durant de ritibus p     mr pennant in his tour in scotland tells us that on the death of a highlander the corpse being stretched on a board and covered with a coarse linen wrapper the friends lay on the breast of the deceased a wooden platter containing a small quantity of salt and earth separate and unmixed the earth an emblem of the corruptible body the salt an emblem of the immortal spirit  all fire is extinguished where a corpse is kept and it is reckoned so ominous for a dog or a cat to pass over it that the poor animal is killed without mercy     mention is made of the closing the eyes and lips  the decent washing  dressing  and wrapping in a linen shroud the face cloth too is of great antiquity  mr strutt tells us that after the closing the eyes etc a linen cloth was put over the face of the deceased  thus we are told that henry the fourth in his last illness seeming to be dead his chamberlain covered his face with a linen cloth english era p  0    of which shroud prudentius the christian poet has these words candore nitentia claro praetendere lintea mos est  hymn ad exequias defunct the interests of our woollen manufactories have interfered with this ancient rite in england  it is customary at this day in northumberland to set a pewter plate containing a little salt salem abhorrere constat diabolum et ratione optima nititur quia sal aeternitatis est et

that expression ye are the salt of the earth    upon the corpse as also a candle in some places  the learned moresin tells us that salt is the emblem of eternity and immortality it is not liable to putrefaction itself and it preserves things that are seasoned with it from decay  he gives us also his conjecture on the use of a candle lucerna seu candela mortuis cadaveribus semper apponitur in domibus et templis quamdiu supra terram sunt  an hinc ducto more oculo vel lucerna incensa veteres aegyptii vitam significabant unde veteres soliti sunt lucernas ardentes sepulchris imponere hac

them for the purposes of renewing decayed friendship amongst old friends etc  moresin tells us that in england they were so profuse on this occasion that it cost less to portion off a daughter than to bury a dead wife these burial feasts are still retained in the north  we have the very coffin of the present age described in durant corpus lotum et sindone obvolutum ac loculo conditum veteres in caenaculis seu tricliniis exponebant p      loculus is a box or chest  thus i find coffins called kists i e chests in our old registers     it appears that among the primitive christians the corpse was sometimes kept four days it was customary in the christian burials of the anglosaxons to leave the head and shoulders of the corpse uncovered till the time of burial that relations etc might take a last view of their deceased friend to this day we yet retain in our way this old custom leaving the coffin of the deceased unscrewed till the time of burial strutt vol i p    manners etc  pelagia postulabat a filio ne came ante diem quartum sepeliret  in gregory of turon requests of her son that her corpse may not be interred till after four days  the payment of mortuaries is of great antiquity it was anciently done by leading or driving a horse or cow etc before the corpse of the deceased at his funeral it was considered as a gift left by a man at his death by way of recompense for all failures in the payment of tithes and oblations and called a corsepresent it is mentioned in the national council of engsham about the year  00  some antiquaries have been led into a mistake by this leading a horse before the corpse and have erroneously represented it as peculiar to military characters colliers ecclesiast hist vol i p       the abuse of this vigil or lakewake is of pretty old standing  i find the following account of a canon made at the provincial synod held in london in the time of edward iii in colliers ecclesiastical history vol i p     the  0th canon endeavors to prevent the disorders committed at peoples watching a corpse before burial here the synod takes notice that the design of peoples meeting together upon such occasions was to join their prayers for the benefit of the dead person that this ancient and serviceable usage was overgrown with superstition and turned into a convenience for theft and debauchery therefore for a remedy against this disorder it is decreed that upon the death of any person none should be allowed to watch before the corpse in a private house excepting near relations and friends of the deceased and such as offered to repeat a set number of psalms for the benefit of his soul the penalty annexed is excommunication  this is also mentioned in becons fol     relics of rome and comprised in the catalogue of those crimes that were anciently cursed with bell book and candle  mr bourne complains of the sport drinking and lewdness used at these lakewakes mr pennant in describing highland ceremonies calls this meeting the latewake i suspect he has put a t for a k thus in describing coken a romantic seat near chesterlestreet he spells it erroneously coker his words are the latewake is a ceremony used at funerals the evening after the death of any person the relations or friends of the deceased meet at the house attended by bagpipe or fiddle the nearest of kin be it wife son or daughter opens a melancholy ball dancing and greeting i e crying violently at the same time and this continues till daylight but with such gambols and frolicks among the younger part of the company that the loss which occasioned them is often more than supplied by the consequences of that night  if the corpse remains unburied for two nights the same rites are renewed thus scythianlike they rejoice at the deliverance of their friends out of this life of misery  he tells us in the same place that the coranich or singing at funerals is still in use in some places the songs are generally in praise of the deceased or a recital of the valiant deeds of him or ancestors  perhaps mr pennant in spelling latewake wished to have the name derived from watching late  none can suppose this but those who are totally ignorant of our ancient language which is preserved in all its pristine purity in the vulgar dialect of the north   in his time  they still continue to resemble too much the ancient bacchanalian orgies  an instance of depravity that highly disgraces human nature it would be treating the serious subject with two much levity to say that if the inconsiderate wretches who abuse such solemn meetings think at all they think with epicurean licentiousness that since life is so uncertain no opportunity should be neglected of transmitting it and that the loss by the death of one relation should be made up as soon as possible by the birth of another  our author uses a remarkable metaphor in this passage he talks or rather babbles concerning putting on undecent pastime  if one were disposed to banter it might be observed that a wardrobe of undecent pastime must consist of very light habits it may be questioned also whether in any affliction we can discover too great resignation  chap iii of following the corpse to the grave what it is an emblem of of carrying greens in our hand what it signifies what use it may be of of psalmody its antiquity the advantage and use of it it has been observed among all nations both in the heathen and the christian world as a becoming and profitable ceremony to follow the corpse to the grave the heathens observed it praecedenti pompa funebri vivi sequuntur tanquam handmulto post morituri al ab alex lib   p    et pol vir lib   c  0 p  0  because it presented to them what would shortly follow how they themselves should be so carried out and laid down in the grave the going of the corpse before showed that their friend was gone before them to the state of death and their following after was as much as to say that they must also in a short time follow him thither for this reason the christian also observes the custom and may if he pleases as he follows the body to the grave entertain himself with a pious meditation upon it in such like thoughts as these of the psalmist psalm xc thou art god from everlasting and world without end thou turnest man to destruction again thou say come again ye children of men for a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday seeing that is past as a watch in the night as soon as thou scatterest them they are even as a sleep and fade away suddenly like the grass in the morning it is green and grows up but in the evening it is cut down dried up and withered do thou therefore o lord psalm xxxix let me know my end and the number of my days that i may be certified how long i have to live behold thou have made my days as it were a span long and mine age is nothing in respect of thee and verily every man living is altogether vanity and now lord what is my hope truly my hope is even in thee deliver me from all mine offenses and o spare me a little that i may recover my strength before i go hence and be no more seen such thoughts as these of our friends and of our own mortality would excite us to prepare for our own change  and as this form of procession is an emblem of our dying shortly after our friend so the carrying of ivy or laurel or rosemary or some of those evergreens is an emblem of the souls immortality it is as much as to say that though the body be dead yet the soul is evergreen and always in life it is not like the body and those other greens which die and revive again at their proper seasons no autumn nor winter can make a change in it but it is unalterably the same perpetually in life and never dying  the romans and other heathens upon this occasion made use of cypress which being once cut will never flourish nor grow any more as an emblem of their dying for ever and being no more in life but instead of that the ancient christians used the things before mentioned they haedera quoque vel laurus and hujusmodi quae semper servant virorem in sarchophago corpori substernuntur ad significandum quod qui moriuntur in christo vivere nec desinunt nam licet mundo moriantur secundum corpus tamen secundum animam vivunt and reviviscunt deo durand rit lib   c    de offic mort laid them under the corpse in the grave to signify that they who die in christ do not cease to live for though as to the body they die to the world yet as to their souls they live to god  and as the carrying of these evergreens is an emblem of the souls immortality so it is also of the resurrection of the body for as these herbs are not entirely plucked up but only cut down and will at the returning season revive and spring up again so the body like them is but cut down for a while and will rise and shoot up again at the resurrection for as the prophet isaiah says isa lxiii    our bones shall flourish like an herb  it was customary greg c    among the ancient jews as they returned from the grave to pluck up the grass two or three times and then throw it behind them saying these words of the psalmist they shall flourish out of the city like grass upon the earth which they did to show that the body though dead should spring up again as the grass thus by these two ancient ceremonies we have placed before our eyes our mortality and immortality the one speaks the death of the body the other the life of the soul nay and the life of the body too for like that herb we carry it is not quite plucked up but shall one day be alive again when it has laid in the earth the winter season the continuance of this world and the warmth and influence of the spring is come the joyful spring of the resurrection it shall be enlivened and shoot up and eternally flourish cor i    for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality o death where is thy sting o grave where is thy victory thanks be to god who gives us the victory through our lord jesus christ  there is another custom used in some places at the procession of funerals which pays a due honor to the dead and gives comfort and consolation to the living and that is the carrying out the dead with psalmody this was an ancient custom of the church for in some of the earliest ages they carried out their dead to the grave with singing of psalms and hymns thus socrates tells us that when the body of babylas the martyr was removed by the order of julian the apostate the christians hoi kata etc soc lib   c     with their women and children rejoiced and sung psalms all the way as they bore the corpse from dauphne to antioch thus was epitaphium pauli hicrom ep     ibid in vit paul paula buried at bethlehem thus did st anthony bury paul the hermit and thus were the generality of men buried after the three first centuries when persecution ceased in imitation of this it is still customary in several parts of this nation to carry out the dead with singing of psalms and hymns of triumph to show that they have ended their spiritual warfare that they have finished their course with joy and are become conquerors which surely is a matter of no little consolation for the loosing of our friend and how becoming is it to pay such honor to the body how is it imitating the blessed angels who rejoiced at meeting of the soul and carrying it to heaven for as they rejoice at her conversion on earth so most certainly they rejoice at her going to heaven and as they rejoice at the carrying of the soul thither so we in imitation of them at the carrying out the body to the grave they rejoice that the soul has got out of a world of sin we that the body out of a world of trouble they that the soul can sin no more we that the body can no more suffer they that the soul enjoys glory and happiness we that the body rests from its labors  when therefore we attend the corpse of a neighbor or relation and this decent ceremony is performed let it also have a share of our thoughts and excite in us joy and comfort and thanksgiving and praise and when these customs are so observed they will be of great advantage to us making us still fitter for the heavenly life and surely a thing of this good and profit is much to be preferred to what has in it nothing but undecency and irreverence such is our laughing and jesting and telling of news when we accompany a neighbor to the grave there is indeed a mean to be observed as in all other things so in this we must neither be too sad nor too merry we must not be so merry as to throw off all the signs of affection and love all the tokens of esteem and humanity nor must we   thessalonians i      sorrow even as others which have no hope but we must jam v    be so merry as to be able to sing psalms and so afflicted as to be excited to pray  observations on chapter iii the ancient christians testified their abhorrence of heathen rites they rejected therefore the pagan custom of burning the dead depositing the inanimate body entire in the ground  the carrying forth to the church and from thence to the grave was performed by near relations or persons of such dignity as the circumstances of the deceased required  singing of psalms in exultation for the conquest of the deceased friend over hell sin and death was the great ceremony used in all funeral processions among the ancient christians  paulam translatam fuisse episcoporum manibus cervicem feretro subjicientibus durant p     st jerome in the epitaph of paula informs us that bishops were what in modern language we call underbearers at her funeral  the learned durant duranti de ritibus p     gives us many quotations from the ancient christian writers to prove that those of the highest orders of clergy thought it not a reproach to their dignity to carry the bier how different an idea of this office prevails in our times  something instead of the pall in nobilibus aureum velamentum super feretrum quo corpus obtegeretur apponi consuetum ibid p     used at present to cover the coffin appears by the same writer to have been of great antiquity  he speaks also of black induebantur atris vestibus praesertim apud gallos  hunc tamen lugubrem et atrum amictum videtur improbare cyprian sermon de mortalitate ibid used in mourning  st cyprian seemed to inveigh against it as the indication of sorrow upon an event which to the christian was matter of joy  mr bourne takes no notice of torches dum autem funus efferebatur faces praeferebantur  constantii corpus delatum fuisse nocturins cantionibus et cereorum ignibus  ibid p     gallos funus honorisice curasse et multitudinem luminum splendorem sibi etiam per diem vendicantem repercusso solis radio refulsisse  ibid mr strutt tells us the burning of torches was very honorable  to have a great many was a special mark of esteem in the person who made the funeral to the deceased  vol ii p  0  of his antiquities thus in the epitaph of bude que naton plus en torches dependu suivant la mode accoutumee en saint a fin quil soit par lobscur entendu que des francois la lumiere est eteinte st genevieve paris  which are still in use on particular occasions in funeral processions  it appears by durant that this custom has been of a long standing  we farther learn from this ritualist that it was customary to invite the poor praeterea convocabantur et invitabantur necdum sacerdotes et religiosi sed et egeni pauperes had our famous poet mr pope an eye to this in ordering by will poor men to support his pall to funerals  i find a beautiful thought on this subject mr strutt in his english era tells us that sir robert knolles in the  th year of henry iv died at his manor in norfolk and his dead body was brought in a litter to london with great pomp and much torch light and it was buried in the white friars church  where was done for him a solemn obsequie with a great feast and lyberall dole to the poor this custom of giving a funeral feast to the chief mourners was universally practiced all over the kingdom as well as giving alms to the poor in proportion to the quality and finances of the deceased vol ii p  0   in st ambroses funeral oration on satyrus cited by durant which i flatter myself will be thought to have deserved a translation  the poor also shed their tears  precious and fruitful tears that washed away the sins of the deceased  they let fall floods of redeeming tears it should seem to have been from such figurative expressions as these in the first christian writers literally understood that the romanists have derived their superstitious doctrine of praying for the dead   funeral sermons also are of great antiquity ceterum priusquam corpus humo injecta contegatur defunctus oratione funebri laudabatur durant p       doles were used at funerals as we learn from st chrysostom  homilia xxxii in matthei cap non  to procure rest to the soul of the deceased and that he might find his judge propitious  dr brown in his urne burial observes that the custom of carrying the corpse as it were out of the world with its feet forward is not inconsonant to reason as contrary to the native posture of man and his production first into it  it may be added to mr bournes observations on evergreens used at funerals dr trusler in his chronology tells us that in the year      yew trees were encouraged in churchyards as being fenced from cattle for the making of bows hence their frequency in churchyards  this seems to me the observation of one totally ignorant of ecclesiastical antiquities are not all plantation grounds fenced from cattle and whence is it that there is usually but one yew tree in each churchyard how much more probable the conjecture of the learned author of the vulgar errors  that the planting of yew trees in churchyards seems to derive its origin from ancient funeral rites in which the doctor conjectures from its perpetual verdure it was used as an emblem of the resurrection  he observes farther that the christian custom of decking the coffin with bay is a most elegant emblem it is said that this tree when seemingly dead will revive from the root and its dry leaves resume their wonted verdure  the

destroyed  chap iv of garlands in country churches of strawing flowers on the grave the antiquity of these customs the innocence of them in some country churches it is customary to hang a garland of flowers over the seats of deceased virgins as a token of esteem and love and an emblem of their reward in the heavenly church  this custom perhaps may be looked upon as sprung from that ancient custom of the heathens of crowning their corpse with garlands in token of victory but mr bingham tells us that we find not this custom used by the ancients in their funeral rites for as he observes the heathen in minutius makes it one topic of accusation against them min p    coronas etiam sepulchris denegatis bing vol  0 p    that they did not crown their sepulchers  but if they did not crown them after the manner of the heathens they had a custom of using crowns of flowers if we may believe cassalion who tells us euit quoque mos ad capita virginum apponendi slorum coronas etc cass de vet sacr christ p     it was a custom of the ancient christians to place crowns of flowers at the heads of deceased virgins for which he quotes damascen gregory nyssen st jerome and st austin and this has probably been the original of this custom among the vulgar  that other custom of strawing flowers upon the graves of their departed friends is also derived from a custom of the ancient church for it was usual in those times for the common sort of people to straw the graves of their friends with various flowers of this there are two notable instances taken notice of by cassalion and several other ritualists the one is that of st ambrose in his funeral oration on the death of valentinian nec ego floribus tumulum ejus asperagam sed spiritum ejus christi odore perfundam spargant alii plenis lilia calathis nobis lilium est christus hoc reliquias ejus sacrabo ambros orat funebri ae obitu valentin i will not sprinkle his grave with flowers but pour on his spirit the odor of christ let others scatter baskets of flowers christ is our lilly and with this will i consecrate his relics  the other is that of st jerome in his epistle to pammachius upon the death of his wife caeteri mariti super tumulos conjugum spargunt violas rosas lilia floresque purpureos and dolorem pectoris his osficiis consolantur pammachius noster sanctum favillam ossaque veneranda eleemosynae balsamis rigat hieron epist ad pammachtum de obitu uxoris whilst other husbands strawed violets and roses and lillies and purple flowers upon the graves of their wives and comforted themselves with such like offices pammachius bedewed her ashes and venerable bones with the balsam of alms  now these instances though they justly commend these other actions and wisely prefer them to the ceremonies of adorning graves with flowers yet they no way decry these ancient customs these lower marks of esteem and honor which the vulgar paid to the remains of their friends were in themselves harmless and innocent and had no censure and as they were so so should the present customs be without any being full as harmless and innocent as the other  observations on chapter iv i have seen many of the garlands our author here speaks of in village churches in the south of england the custom seems to be entirely laid aside in the north not entirely  i saw lately in the churches of wolsingham and stanhope in the county of durham specimens of these garlands the form of a womans glove cut in white paper hangs in each of them  it is undoubtedly of very high antiquity  in the earlier ages of the church virginity out of deference it should seem to the virgin mother was honored with almost divine adoration there is little doubt but that nunneries and this garlana claim one common origin  durant condito et curato

observe the generality of old people among the commonalty as they enter into the church to turn their faces toward the altar and bow or kneel that way this no doubt is the remains of that ancient custom of the church of worshipping toward the east for in the ancient church they worshipped that way upon several accounts first that by so worshipping they might lift up their minds to god who is called the light and the creator of light and therefore st austin says cum ad orationem stamus ad orientem covertimur unde caelum surgit etc ut admoneatur animus ad naturam excellentiorem se convertere id est ad dominum aug de sermon domini in mont lib   cap   when we pray standing we turn our faces to the east from whence the day springs that we might be reminded of turning to a more excellent nature namely the lord secondly that for as much as man was driven out of paradise which is toward the east he ought to look that way which is an emblem of his desire to return thither st damascen therefore tells us that ibid because the scripture says that god planted paradise in eden toward the east where he placed the man which he had formed whom he punished with banishment upon his transgression and made him dwell over against paradise in the western part we therefore pray says he being in quest of our ancient country and as it were panting after it do worship god that way thirdly it was used when any were baptized they first turned their faces to the west and so renounced the devil and then to the east and made their covenant with christ lastly they prayed that way believing that our savior would come to judgment from that quarter of the heavens for as the lightning comes out of the east and shines unto the west so shall the coming of the son of man be and he is to come in like manner as he ascended and that he ascended up eastward from mount olivet st ibid damascen assures us for says he when he ascended into heaven he was taken up eastward and his disciples worshipped him that way and therefore chiefly it was that in the ancient church they prayed with their faces to the east and that many of our own church at this day turn their st damasc lib   c    orthod fid faces to that quarter of the world at the repetition of the creed  what may more confirm this and speak it to have been the universal opinion of the church is the ancient custom of burying the corpse with the feet to the east and the head to the west which custom is continued to this day in the whole church of england this was observed for the same reason that at the coming of christ to judgment from the oriental part of heaven our bodies might be found in a praying posture with their faces toward the east  our learned countryman gregory tells us that the holy men of jerusalem hold a tradition generally received from their ancients that our savior himself was buried with his face and feet toward the east it is affirmed by the geographers of the holy land and bid says introcuntes ab orient in domum illam rotundam quae in petra excisa est viderunt angelum sedentem ad meridianam partem loci illius ubi positum fuerat corpus jesu hoc enim erat in dextris quod nimirum corpus quod supinum jacens caput habebat ad occasum dexteram necesse est habere ad austrum bed in dic sanct paschae tom   that as the holy women entered at the eastern part into the roundhouse which is hewn out in the rock they saw the angel sitting at the south part of the place where the body of jesus had lain that is at his right hand for undoubtedly his body having his face upwards and its head to the west must have its right hand to the south cassalion says adeo tenaces fuere prisci illi fideles in hoc ritu respiciendi in orientem ut non solum ipsi viventes hoc in eorum precibus exact servarent verum etiam mortui eorum corpora supina in sepulchris facie orientem respicerent cass de vet rit christ p  0 the faithful of old were so observing of this ceremony of looking toward the east that they not only strictly observed it in their prayers when living but even when they were dead their bodies were placed with their faces upwards in the sepulcher looking toward the east  the learned dr comber in his discourse of the solemn interment has these words upon this subject we may note the positure and position of the corpse which among the christians has always been to turn the feet to the east with the head to the west that so they may be ready to meet the lord whom the ancients did believe should appear in the oriental part of heaven durand rat lib   cap    or as our ingenious mr gregory believes that they might be in the posture of prayer with their faces to the east as soon as they were raised there are some ancient authors tell us that the old inhabitants of attica buried thus before the days of solon who as they report convinced the athenians that the island of salamis did of right belong to them by showing them dead bodies looking that way and sepulchers turned toward the east as they used to bury diog laert vit solon etc and the scholiast upon thucidides says it was the manner of all the greeks to bury their dead thus though a learned modern writer supposes these authors mistaken and cites plutarch and elian to prove that the athenians turned their dead toward the west however it is certain that all nations had one certain way of placing the corpse from which they would not vary and we christians have so great antiquity for our custom that we ought not out of singularity to alter it  no doubt but this learned man had great reason for this conclusion as well knowing that this ancient rite was struck at by the whole herd of sectaries as a filly fancy and an idle dream who never would observe it were it not that they are sometimes obliged but would with those who are not obliged act the very reverse and bury north and south i wish there were no powerfuller enemies to it than them now a days but as a mans enemies are too often those of his own household so it is to be lamented that some who pretend to be of our own church are upon all occasions secret advocates against this ceremony when therefore there is such opposition without and such treachery within it is high time to be on the guard against our enemies least a ceremony so venerable for its antiquity and so useful in its observation be laid aside was it but for this one thing that it speaks the hope of the whole christian church since the earliest times of christianity about the resurrection of the same body it is too true that there are some at this time of the day as well as were in the days of the apostle who think it a thing incredible that god should raise the dead some really disbelieving the resurrection of any body and others that of the same body but as long as this ceremony is in being it will always be a ready proof that the whole christian church did not only believe the resurrection of the body but of that very body which was laid down in the grave for they observed it that they might be ready with their faces to meet their savior at his coming to judgment which certainly implies that they believed that very body should rise again  observations on chapter v we may add to mr bournes remarks that the custom is still retained in many churches of turning to the altar while the congregation are repeating the creed  the forms are both derived to us from the same origin we need not hesitate to pronounce as well the bowings aulam regiam id est ecclesiam ingredientes ad altar inclinamus quod quasi regem milites adoramus eterni enim regis milites sumus durandi rational p      the learned mr mede tells us that what reverential guise ceremony or worship they used at their ingress into churches in the ages next to the apostles and some he believes they did is wholly buried in silence and oblivion the jews used to bow themselves toward the mercyseat  the christians after them in the greek and oriental churches have time out of mind and without any known beginning used to bow in like manner  they do it at this day see binghams antiquities   as the turnings about to the east or altar to be superstitious  they are alike vestiges of the ancient popish ceremonial law  one who has left a severe satire on the retainers of those forms and ceremonies that lean toward popish superstition tells us hickeringills ceremony monger p    if i were a papist or anthropomorphite who believes that god is enthroned in the east like a grave old king i profess i would bow and cringe as well as any limberham of them all and pay my adoration to that point of the compass the east but if men believe that the holy one who inhabits eternity is also omnipresent why do not they make correspondent ceremonies of adoration to every point of the compass  concession must be made by every advocate for manly and rational worship that there is nothing more in the east than in the belfry at the west end or in the body of the church we wonder therefore how ever this custom was retained by protestants the cringes and bowings of the roman catholics to the altar is in adoration of the corporal i find in a curious collection of godly ballads in the scotch language edinburgh      the following passage which has been intended no doubt as an argument against transubstantiation gif god be transubstantiall in breid with hoc est corpus

ophelia to have drowned herself this quotation therefore seems to confirm the learned annotators explication  chap vi of the time of cockcrow whether evil spirits wander about in the time of night and whether they fly away at the time of cockcrow reflections upon this encouraging us to have faith and trust in god it is a received tradition among the vulgar that at the time of cockcrowing the midnight spirits forsake these lower regions and go to their proper places they wander say they about the world from the dead hour of night when all things are buried in sleep and darkness till the time of cockcrowing and then they depart hence it is that in countryplaces where the way of life requires more early labor they always go cheerfully to work at that time whereas if they are called abroad sooner they are apt to imagine every thing they see or hear to be a wandering ghost shakespeare has given us an excellent account of this vulgar notion in his tragedy of hamlet  ber it was about to speak when the cock crew  hor and then it started like a guilty thing upon a dreadful summons i have heard the cock that is the trumpet to the day does with his lofty and shrill sounding throat awake the god of day and at his warning whether in sea or fire in earth or air the extravagant and erring spirit hyes to its confine and of the truth herein this present object made probation  mar it faded at the crowing of the cock some say that ever against that season comes wherein our saviors birth is celebrated the bird of dawning sings all night long and then they say no spirit does walk abroad the nights are wholesome then no planet strikes no fairy takes no witch has power to harm so gracious and so hallowed is that time  now to show what truth there is in this vulgar opinion i shall consider first what truth there is in the roaming of spirits in the night and secondly whether they are obliged to go away at cockcrow  i believe none who assent to the truth of divine revelation deny that there are good and evil angels attending upon men the one to guard and protect them and the other to harm and work their ruin that the one are those heb i    ministering spirits which are sent out to minister to the heirs of salvation the other the roaring lion and his instruments job ii   who wander too and fro in the earth these matt xii    unclean spirits who wander through dry places seeking rest and finding none  nor i believe will it be questioned that there have been apparitions of good and evil spirits and that many with our saviors disciples have been affrighted and cried out not only with supposing they had seen but really with seeing a spirit of this the testimony of all ages and scripture it self are a sufficient demonstration  what then could these have ordinarily been but the appearances of some of those angels of light or darkness for i am far from thinking that either the ghosts of the damned or the happy either the soul of a dives or a lazarus returns here any more for as st athanasius observes hai en tois naois etc athan tom   p    these visions and shades of the saints which appear in the temples and at the tombs are not the souls of the saints themselves but the good angels appearing in their shapes not that god could not remand the ghost of samuel and order it again to visit the earth as he made moses and elias to appear at our saviors transfiguration but that a thing of this nature was very uncommon and seldom happened  taking it therefore for granted that there have been apparitions of angels i believe it will also be owned that these apparitions have frequently happened in the night and truly was there no direct proof of this yet the notion of their appearing in the night being as it were linked and chained to our idea of an apparition would almost persuade us that the night is the most proper time for such appearances whether it is that the fables of nurses lock on human underst as an ingenious author imagines have so associated the idea of spirit to the night that the one never appears without the other or whether there is something in the presence of night some awfulness and horror which naturally dispose the mind of man to these reflections i am indeed very inclinable to believe that these legendary stories of nurses and old women are the occasion of much greater fears than people without them would generally have of these things but i cannot help thinking that the presence of night would naturally lead a man to some reflection of spirits without any such cause as that learned author mentions there are some particular times which will naturally raise some particular thoughts thus on a bright sunny day we are naturally disposed to mirth and gaiety when the day overcasts or the weather is hazy we then turn indolent and dull and sooth our selves in melancholy if it thunder and lighten we think of the day of judgment and sudden death and thus also the night as it inclines us to grave and serious thoughts raises in us horror and dismay and makes us afraid even when our judgment tells us there is no fear so it may of it self be looked upon as a natural cause of such reflections  but however this be we must necessarily own that spirits have frequently appeared in the night or we must give the lie to the traditions of all ages to historians profane and sacred and the wisest and best in the generations of men  in the heathen world there are many instances of which i shall only mention this one out of plutarch in vit mar brut trans duke one night before brutus passed out of asia he was very late all alone in his tent with a dim light burning by him all the rest of the army being hushed and silent and musing with himself and very thoughtful as he turned his eye to the door he saw a strange and terrible appearance of a prodigious and frightful body coming toward him without speaking brutus boldly asked him what art thou man or god or upon what business do thou come to us the spirit answered i am thy evil genius thou shall see me at philippi to which brutus not at all disturbed replied then i will see thee there  in the sacred writings we have job job terrified with visions of the night when deep sleep falls upon men fear came upon him and trembling which made all his bones to shake then a spirit passed by before his face and the hair of his flesh stood up in the night genesis xxxii jacob wrestled with the angel in the night an angel delivered acts xii peter out of prison etc  but though it be true from scripture that there have been nightly apparitions yet these are chiefly of good angels whereas this opinion principally means the appearances of evil spirits it must be owned indeed that the appearances of evil spirits if literally are yet but very seldom mentioned in the night in scripture but however that they wander and appear at night is very deducible from if not literally mentioned in it theirs is the land of darkness and the shadow of death they are reserved under chains of darkness to the judgment of the great day and we know that every one that does evil naturally hates the light they therefore love darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil the night therefore in a more especial manner seems to be their hour and the power of darkness  this was the opinion of the jews as may be learned from the fear of the apostles when they saw our savior about the fourth watch of the night coming to them upon the waters matt xiv    they were affrighted and cried out supposing they had seen a spirit doctor whitby upon this place says that the jews had then an opinion of hurtful spirits walking in the night is evident from the seventy who rendered from the pestilence walking in darkness apo pragmatos diaporeuomenou en skotei from the fear of the devils that walk in the night  and that this was also the opinion of the ancient christians is evident not only from their dividing the night into four watches the evening midnight cockcrowing and the morning which were the military divisions of the night and which they si quidem and in nocte stationes and vigiliae militares in quatuor parts divisae ternis horarum spatiis secernuntur isidore lib   de eccle offici cap    observed to guard their souls from the silent incursions of evil spirits as the others did those of the enemy but also from their many relations of such appearances cassian in giving an account of the watching of the ancient monks and their being assaulted with midnight spirits tells us that at the beginning of the monkish life tanta namque erat eorum feritas ut vix pauci  tolerare habitationem solitudinis possent  ita eorum atrocitas grassabatur and frequentes ac visibiles sentiebantur aggressus ut non auderent omnes pariter noctibus obdormire sed vicissim aliis degustantibus somnum alii vigilias celebrantes psalmis and orationibus seu lectionibus in haerebant cassian coll   cap    the rage of the midnight spirits was so great that but few and these too men of age and unshaken resolution were able to endure the life in the desert for such was their fierceness that where eight or ten had been together in a monastery they would have made frequent and visible incursions insomuch that they never all slept at the same time but took it by turns some watching the rest and exercising themselves in singing psalms in praying and reading and st athanasius in his life of anthony the hermit tells of many conflicts that good man had in the night with the powers of darkness whilst they endeavored to batter him from the strong holds of his faith and what can our church chiefly mean in the collect for aid against perils but that god would send us protection from all the spirits of darkness these midnight wanderers of the world and for this reason every good man when he lies down to sleep at night desires the great keeper of israel who never slumbereth nor sleeps to send his holy angels to pitch their tents round about him and banish from him the spirits of the night  so far then this tradition is just and good that there are at midnight spirits who wander about the world going too and fro in the earth seeking whom they may devour let us now in the next place enquire what truth there is in the other part of it namely that they always fly away at cockcrow  this opinion whatever truth there may be in it is certainly very ancient we have it mentioned by the christian poet prudentius who flourished in the beginning of the fourth century as a tradition of common belief his words are these ferunt vagantes daemones loetos tenebris noctium gallo canente exterritos sparsim timere and cedere invisa nam vicinitas lucis salutis numinis rupto tenebrarum situ noctis fugat satellites hoc esse signum proescii norunt repromissoe spei qua nos soporis liberi speramus adventum dei they say the wandering powers that love the silent darkness of the night at cockcrowing give over to rove and all in fear do take their flight the approaching salutary morn the approach divine of hated day makes darkness to its place return and drives the midnight ghosts away they know that this an emblem is of what preceeds our lasting bliss that morn when graves give up their dead in certain hope to meet their god   cassian also who lived in the same century giving an account of a multitude of devils who had been abroad in the night says aurora itaque superveniente cum omnis haec ab oculis evanisset daemonum multitudo cass coll   c    that as soon as the morn approached they all vanished and fled away by this we see that this was a current opinion at this time of day but what reason they had for it except some relations of the disappearing of evil spirits at that hour i never yet have met with but there have been produced at that time of night things of very memorable worth which might perhaps raise the pious credulity of some men to imagine that there was something more in it than in other times it was about the time of cockcrowing when our savior was born and the angels sung the first christmascarol to the poor shepherds in the fields of bethlehem now it may be presumed that as the savior of the world was then born and the heavenly host had then descended to proclaim the news that the angels of darkness would be terrified and confounded and immediately fly away and perhaps this consideration has partly been the foundation of this opinion for as this may easily be supposed so perhaps it has been imagined that the spirits of darkness having always in memory that fatal hour are startled and frighted away as the cock proclaims it  it was also about this time when he rose from the dead and when the great sun of righteousness was risen upon the world no wonder that all the clouds of darkness and wickedness were dispelled no wonder that the conquered powers of hell were not able to show their heads and this perhaps has been another reason of their imagining that spirits go away at that time  a third reason is that passage in the book of genesis where jacob wrestled with the angel for a blessing where the angel says unto him genesis xxxii let me go for the day breaks  but indeed this tradition seems more especially to have risen from some particular circumstances attending the time of cockcrowing and which as prudentius seems to say above are an emblem of the approach of the day of the resurrection for when we leave the world we lie down in our graves and rest from our labors sleep and darkness lay hold upon us and there we abide till the last day appear when the voice of the archangel shall awake us that we may meet the lord of light and day and when we leave the common business and care of life we lie down in our beds as in a grave buried as it were in sleep and darkness till the cock crow the welcome messenger of the news of day  the circumstances therefore of the time of cockcrowing being so natural a figure and representation of the morning of the resurrection the night so shadowing out the night of the grave the third watch being as some suppose the time our savior will come to judgment at the noise of the cock awakening sleepy man and telling him as it were the night is far spent the day is at hand representing so naturally the voice of the archangel awakening the dead and calling up the righteous to everlasting day so naturally does the time of cockcrowing shadow out these things that probably some good wellmeaning men have been brought to believe that the very devils themselves when the cock crew and reminded them of them did fear and tremble and shun the light  now in answer to the first of these conjectures it is very likely the evil spirits did fly away in the morning of the nativity and because of our saviors birth and that company of the heavenly host might be afraid and retire into thick darkness yet it will not hence follow that it always happens so at the time of cockcrowing for if they did fly away that morning the circumstances of our saviors birth the heavenly glory of the angelick quire their music and their presence were the occasion of it and why only the bare remembrance of what happened at that time should always at the time of cockcrowing drive them away rather than when they remember it at another no reason seems to be given  as to the second conjecture namely that it was the time of our saviors rising from the dead i answer in the same manner that though it be allowed that the evil spirits might have returned to the land of darkness upon our saviors rising from the dead yet why it should occasion them always to do so at that time no reason can be given  as to the third conjecture it is easy to observe that this was a good angel whereas they that shun the light are bad ones this was the angel of the covenant the creator of light and the lord of the day we may therefore as well imagine that it was not in his power to get out of the arms of jacob without saying let me go as to suppose he was obliged to go because he said the day breaks the meaning of which words according to willet is not that the angel was gone to the blessed company of the angels to sing their morning hymn to god as the hebrews imagine for the angels not only in the morning but at other times are exercised in praising god but the angel thus speaks according to the custom of men having now taken the form and shape of a man as though he had have to other business and leaving jacob also to his affairs  the last conjecture of the rise of this tradition seems to carry greater probability than the others for as these things are a representation of the circumstances of the morning of the resurrection so they must sure enough bring that last day into remembrance and they never can do so but as surely they must create terror and confusion in all the devils and ghosts of the night whilst they assure them they shall never any more enjoy the realms of bliss but be hurried into that matt xxv    everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels but that these things are the occasion of their flying away at the approach of day is not to be supposed on the contrary the devil and his angels ramble over the world in daylight and are midday devils as well as midnight ones for the devil is incessant in his temptations and therefore he is abroad in the day as well as the night though perhaps has seldom appeared but in darkness thus st austin in one of his meditations et ideo deus meus ad te clamamus libera nos ab adversario nostro quotidiano qui sive dormiamus sive vigilemus  die ac nocte fraudibus and artibus nunc palam nunc occulte sagittas venenatas contra nos dirigens ut interficiat animas nostras aug sol cap    we implore thee o god that thou would deliver us from our daily enemy who by his wiles and cunning is always watching us day and night sleeping and waking and both openly and in secret shooting at us his poisoned arrows that he may destroy our souls  and now what though this be true as it most certainly seems to be so that at the cheerful hour of cockcrowing the wandering ghosts are not driven away but still continue going too and fro what though then their power be still the same and their intentions as fully bent to do evil consider but that gods care and providence govern the world and there will be found as much safety for us in the midst of evil spirits as if they absented at that time the almighty power of god is the same then as at other times nothing but that preserved us continually and that will always be able to preserve us however great may be the malice of devils however desirous of working our ruin though they watch all opportunities and are unwearied in tempting us yet the loving kindness of the lord endures for ever and his mercy is over all his works he will not suffer our foot to be moved he that keeps us will not sleep we shall not be afraid of the sun by day nor the moon by night for the pestilence that walks in darkness nor for the sickness that destroys in the noonday  are we then afraid of darkness and the presence of night let us remember the creator of them and have but faith in him and we shall find our night turned into day in his light shall we see light we shall be as secure as if there was no darkness about us as well knowing that that god which protects us sees through the thickest mediums and the darkest night for with him the darkness is no darkness but the night is as clear as the day the darkness and light to him are both alike or are we afraid of that old serpent the devil that nightly rambler of the world who is a lover of night and darkness let us trust in god and no harm shall happen to us if we will but fear no evil his rod and his staff shall comfort us though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death for god has reserved the devil and his angels in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day though therefore he is permitted to wander the world yet he is so chained up that without gods particular order or permission he is not allowed to touch the sons of men and he is so reserved and kept in darkness that it is not in his power even barely to appear and be visible to them without the permission of god so little reason has every good man to fear the spite and malice of all the devils in hell  when then the night pours out her terrors covers all things with darkness and strikes thee with horror lift but up thy eyes to the hills from whence comes thy help and thou shall clearly see that our lord god is a light and defense to thee  quia filiis lucis and in noctibus dies est quando enim sine lumine est cui lumen in cord est aut quando sol ei and dies non est cui sol and dies christus est cyprian de orat dom for to those who are the children of the light the day shines in the night they are never without light whose hearts are illuminated never without sunshine whose sun is christ in short then if thou fear darkness look up to christ and thou have eternal day if the angels of darkness look but up with the eye of faith and thou shall see the mountains full of chariots and horses of fire thou shall see as did the servant of the prophet elisha that they who be with us are more than they who are against us no matter then whether the spirits of the night go away or only tremble at the time of cockcrowing for sure we are that the angel of the lord tarrieth round about them that fear him and delivers them nay that god himself will arise and scatter his enemies and make them that hate him to fly before him and if god be for us who can be against us  observations on chapter vi mr bourne might have styled this chapter a sermon on spiritwalking and yet i cannot help thinking that the nurse prevails over the priest in it

witty will no doubt laugh at every thing he has advanced perhaps it will be granted on all hands that he has not thrown any new lights on the dark subject i make no pretensions to any abilities for discussing the question and am of opinion that as we know so little of the invisible world we cannot express ourselves with too much diffidence in speaking of it  it must however be allowed that writers of the highest character for probity and knowledge have transmitted to us accounts of spirits and apparitions fancy imagination misinterpretations of the sacred writings on that subject or credulity must have deceived them for it is impossible to believe them guilty of the baseness of an intention to deceive us the frequent impostures i shall only instance the cocklane ghost in our own times that are to be met with of this kind naturally incline us to believe that all such relations are either the forgeries of cunning men or the idle tales of weak ones it is impossible to follow our author through all the howbeits moreovers and neverthelesses of his tedious discourse but to one thing in his peroration we readily subscribe our most unfeigned assent it is that a good man has not the least reason to fear the spite and malice of all the devils in hell  our divine discovers every where an intention of rooting out the old man from the hearts of his readers i shall be sparing of my quotations of chapter and verse as i do not think this a proper place to imitate him in and purpose only on the present occasion to eraze the vestiges of the old woman the impressions of which are still too visibly to be traced on human nature  it was the fashion when mr bourne wrote that clergymen should lard every composition with scripture phrases and nothing seems to have been thought palatable by them in which every period was not seasoned with a spice of divinity  these great textuaries overlooked one passage of holy writ to every thing there is a season  religion is one thing and the entertainment of innocent curiosity another  if clergymen take care not to permit these relaxations from severer studies to engross too much of their time none but narrowminded bigots will think the investigation of ancient manners an improper amusement for them  the spectator there is another passage in the spectator where he introduces the girls in the neighborhood and his landladys

so vulgar tradition has it haunted by a nightly guest which appeared in the shape of a mastiff dog etc and terrified such as were afraid of shadows this word is a corruption of the anglosaxon gast spiritus anima  i have heard when a boy many stories concerning it   parts the aftermidnight and the dead of the night are the most solemn of them all and have therefore it should seem been appropriated by ancient superstition to the walking of spirits  chap vii of churchyards why the vulgar are generally afraid of passing through them at night the original of this fear that there is nothing in them now more than in other places to be afraid of the most of ignorant people are afraid of going through a churchyard at nightime if they are obliged upon some hasty and urgent affair they fear and tremble till they are beyond its bounds but they generally avoid it and go further about it would no question be better if there were fewer pathways through churchyards than there are both as it would prevent several abuses committed in them and also cause the ashes of the dead to be in greater quiet and more undisturbed peace we should not then see churchyards changed into common dunghills nor should we tread so frequently upon the bones of our friends but when for the convenience of neighborhood or other reasons there are allowed public ways it is a very great weakness to be afraid of passing through them  the reason of this fear is a notion they have imbibed that in churchyards there is a frequent walking of spirits at the deadtime of night indeed there is at that time something awful and horrible every where and it must be confessed something more solemn in a churchyard than in the generality of other places but that it is then more frequented with apparitions and ghosts than other places are is at this time of day entirely groundless and without any reason  the original of this timorousness may be deduced from the heathens for they believed that the departed ghosts came out of their tombs and sepulchers and wandered about the place where the body lay buried thus maerin saepe animas imis excire sepulchris  vidi  bucol   virg  virgil tells us that maeris could call the ghosts out of their sepulchers and nunc animae tenues  sepulchris  errant  ovid fast ovid that ghosts came out of the sepulchers and wandered about and clemens alexandrinus in his admonitions to the gentiles upbraids them with the gods they worshipped which poos oun etc admonit ad gent p    says he are wont to appear at tombs and sepulchers and which are nothing but fading specter and airy forms and the learned mr mede observes from a passage of this same ancient father mede lib   p     de cultu demon that the heathens supposed the presence and power of demons for so the greeks called the souls of men departed at their coffins and sepulchers as though there always remained some natural tie between the deceased and their relicts agreeable to this dr scot scot christ life p    part   in his discourse of the christian life speaks of gross and sensual souls who appeared often after their separation in churchyards or charnelhouses where their bodies were laid the plat phaed p     soul that is infected with a great lust to the body continues so for a great while after death and suffering many reluctances hovers about this visible place and is hardly drawn from thence by force by the demon that has the guard and care of it by the visible place he means p     ibid their monuments and sepulchers where the shadowy fantasms of such souls have sometimes appeared  it having therefore been a current opinion of the heathens that places of burial and churchyards were frequently haunted with specter and apparitions it is easy to imagine that the opinion has been handed from them among the ignorant and unlearned throughout all the ages of christianity to the present day and indeed though now there may be no such things yet that there have been need not be disputed not that they were the real souls of men departed for i cannot see for what reason it should be supposed  scot christ ibid however unacquainted such souls might be with the pleasures of spirits that they are permitted to wander to hover about and linger after their bodies it seems rather to be true what is mentioned of such apparitions in st athanasiuss questions to antiochius that athan tom   p   0 these apparitions of the saints which appear at tombs and temples are not the souls of the saints themselves but the good angels appearing in their likeness and i imagine it must be so too with the souls of bad men they appear not themselves but they are represented by the evil angels for the soul upon the departure returns to god that gave it who allots it its station in the world of spirits where it is kept till the day of judgment in happiness or misery when it shall receive its compleation of the one or the other however whatever these apparitions were they are a certain proof that such appearances have been in such places and indeed to add no more it is the whole voice of antiquity  but now with us god be thanked the scene is changed we live not in the darkness of error but in the light of truth we worship not demons but the god of the whole earth and our temples are not the temples of idols but the temples of the holy god if among the heathens such delusions were permitted it was because god had forsaken them but when he vouchsafes to have his residence in his holy temple we are the further from harm the nearer we approach it psalm lxxxiv there the sparrow has found her an house and the swallow a nest where she may lay her young and there shall no harm happen to good men but they shall be rather protected because they are so near their

suorum formidinem inhumari intra urbem et sepulchra extrui circa deorum templa etc deprav rel orig in verbo  mr strutt tells us that before the time of christianity it was held unlawful to bury the dead within the cities but they used to carry them out into the fields hard by and there deposited them toward the end of the sixth century augustine obtained of king ethelbert a temple of idols where the king used to worship before his conversion and made a burying place of it but st cuthbert afterward obtained leave to have yards made to the churches proper for the reception of the dead  anglosaxon aeta vol i p     that churchyards were used for the purposes of interment in order to remove superstition  burial was in ancient times without the walls of cities and towns lycurgus he tells us first introduced gravestones within the walls and as it were brought home the ghosts to the very doors  thus we compel horses that are apt to startle to make the nearest possible approaches to the objects at which they have taken the alarm  our author is certainly very right when he tells us that churchyards are as little frequented by apparitions and ghosts as other places and that therefore it is a weakness to be afraid of passing through them superstition however will always attend ignorance and the night as she continues to be the mother of dews will also never fail of being the fruitful parent of chimerical fears now it is the time of night that the graves all gaping wide every one lets forth his sprite in the church way path to glide shakespeare   when the sun sets shadows that showed at noon but small appear most long and terrible dryden the inconveniences complained of by our author in the first part of this chapter we have had the pleasure of seeing remedied with great decency and propriety the churchyards here are now all enclosed they are no longer the receptacles of filth or haunts of nightly lewdness and the ashes of our friends and ancestors are suffered to remain as he wished in greater quiet and more undisturbed peace  chap viii of visiting wells and fountains the original of this custom the naming of them of great antiquity the worship paid them by the papists was gross idolatry in the dark ages of popery it was a custom if any well had an awful situation and was seated in some lonely melancholy vale if its water was clear and limpid and beautifully  viridi si margin clauderet undas  herba  juven sat   margind with the tender grass or if it was looked upon as having a medicinal quality to gift it to some saint and honor it with his name hence it is that we have at this day wells and fountains called some st johns st mary magdalens st marys well etc  to these kind of wells the common people are accustomed to go on a summers evening to refresh themselves with a walk after the toil of the day to drink the water of the fountain and enjoy the pleasing prospect of shade and stream  now this custom though at this time of day very commendable and harmless and innocent seems to be the remains of that superstitious practice of the papists of paying adoration to wells and fountains for they imagined there was some holiness and sanctity in them and so worshipped them in the canons of st anselm made in the year   0  we find this superstitious practice in some measure forbid johnson consti st anselm can    let no one attribute reverence or sanctity to a dead body or a fountain or other things as sometimes is to our knowledge without the bishops authority and in the   th of the canons made in the reign of king edgar in the year     it is ordered johnson consti   0 that every priest industriously advance christianity and extinguish heathenism and forbid the worshipping of fountains etc mr johnson says upon this canon that the worshipping of wells and fountains was a superstition which prevailed in this nation till the age before the reformation nay i cannot say it is extinguished yet among the papists in the ages of dark popery it was thought sufficient to forbid the honoring of wells and fountains without the bishops approbation  the giving of names to wells is of great antiquity we find it a custom in the days of the old patriarchs abraham observed this custom and therefore the well which he recovered from the servants of abimeleck he genesis xxi    called beersheba or the well of the oath because there they swear both of them thus also isaac when his herdsmen had found a well and the herdsmen of gerar had a contest with them about the right of it ibid    called the name of the well eseck that is strife because they strove with him and he dug another well and strove for that also and he called the name of it sitnah that is hatred and he removed from thence and dug another well and for that they strove not and he called the name of it rehoboth that is room and he said for now the lord has made room for us and we shall be fruitful in the land and we read it was at jacobs well where jesus talked with the woman of samaria to give names therefore to wells is of an ancient standing but to pay homage and worship to them was never heard of among the people of god till they sunk into gross idolatry and became worshippers of stocks and stones when the creature became worshipped instead of the creator then was this custom first introduced in the ages of popish ignorance and idolatry  there need be no question but as this custom is practically heathenish so it is also originally for the heathens were wont to worship streams and fountains and to suppose that the nymphs whom they imagined the goddesses of the waters presided over them as the papists have borrowed many of their silly and superstitious ceremonies from the religion of the heathens so this in particular a sottish stupid and abominable custom they could borrow no where else for we had no such custom neither at any time the churches of god  observations on chapter viii i find little that may be added to our authors account of the superstitious adoration of wells and fountains there are interdictions of this superstition in the laws of king canute also preserved in whelocs edition of bedes church history haedenscype bith that man peorthige  oththe flodpaeter pyllas oththe stanas etc   leges canuti regis p  0    i have frequently observed shreds or bits of rags upon the bushes that overhang a well in the road to benton a village in the neighborhood of newcastle it is called the rag well this name is undoubtedly of a very long standing the spring has been visited for some disorder or other and these ragofferings are the relics of the then prevailing popular superstition  thus mr pennant tells us they visit the well of spey in scotland for many distempers and the well of drachaldy for as many offering small pieces of money and bits of rags the custom of affixing ladles of iron etc by a chain to wells is of great antiquity mr strutt in his anglosaxon era tells us that edwine caused ladles or cups of brass to be fastened to the clear springs and wells for the refreshment of the passengers venerable bede is his authority  this custom is still retained in many places in the north  pennants add p     fitzstephen monk of canterbury in his description of the ancient city of london has these words there are on the north part of london principal fountains of water sweet wholesome and clear streaming from among the glistering pebble stones  in this number holy well clerken well and st clements well are of most note and frequented above the rest when scholars and the youth of the city take the air abroad in the summer evenings mr shaw in his history of the province of moray tells us that true rational christian knowledge which was almost quite lost under popery made very slow progress after the reformation  that the prevailing ignorance was attended with much superstition and credulity heathenish and romish customs were much practiced pilgrimages to wells and chapels were frequent etc  we had a remarkable well of this kind at jesmond at the distance of about a mile from newcastle  one of our principal streets is said to have its name from an inn that was in it to which the pilgrims that flocked hither for the benefit of the supposed holy water used to resort  stow p   0  a well was a most valuable treasure in those hot and dry countries which composed the scene of the patriarchal history and therefore we find in genesis that it was a frequent subject of contention fontinalia in roman antiquity was a religious feast celebrated on the   th of october in honor of the nymphs of wells and fountains  the ceremony consisted in throwing nosegays into the fountains and putting crowns of flowers upon the wells   chap ix of omens their original the observation of them sinful omens and prognostications of things are still in the mouths of all though only observed by the vulgar in country places especially they are in great repute and are the directors of several actions of life being looked on by them as presages of things future or the determiners of present good or evil if lepus quoque occurrens in via infortunatum iter praesagit and ominosum alex ab alex lib   c    p     a hare cross their way it is an omen of ill luck if saepe sinistra cava praedixit ab ilice cornix virg bucol   a crow cry it portends something evil if maxim vero abominatus est bubo tristis and dira avis voce funesta and gemitu qui formidolosa dirasque necessitates and magnos moles instare portendit alex ab alex lib   c    p   0 an owl which they reckon a most abominable and unlucky bird sends forth its hoarse and dismal voice it is an omen of the approach of some terrible thing that some dire calamity and some great misfortune is near at hand if salt fall toward them to be sure something has happened to one in the family or is shortly to happen to themselves such also is the chattering of a magpye the cry of ravens the deadwatch crickets etc  this is a copy of the omens of the heathens deinde anguribus and reliqui reges usi et exactis regibus nihil public sine auspiciis nec domi nec militiae gerabatur cic de divin lib   who never went upon any enterprise nor undertook any business of moment without consulting the augurs and wisemen and being guided by omens and presages of things hence it was that they consulted the intrails of beasts the flights of birds and several other things and that the very things abovementioned as the authorities there declare have been observed by them yea they have observed them even in the remotest ages beyond the days of the oldest records the heathen world therefore was full of them and without all doubt they have been handed down to us from these times  and as it is not to be questioned but we had them from the heathens so in all probability the heathens have taken them from the people of god and built many of their folies and ominous superstitions on a custom which they alone were indulged in for in the earliest age of the world when a matter of any great consequence was depending and the servants of god would know what the event would be they asked a sign of god by desiring that such a thing might happen if they were to succeed and god was sometimes so condescending as to grant them their desire thus we read that sam i    iii  0 jonathan accompanied only by his armor bearer not fearing the steepness of the rocks nor multitudes of enemies attempted the garrison of the philistines and conquered through a token of this nature if they say says he to his armorbearer tarry until we come up then we will stand still in our place and will not go up unto them but if they say come up unto us then we will go up for the lord has delivered them into our hands and this shall be a sign unto us and so indeed it came to pass god who had inspired jonathan with this thought directing the tongues of the others according to his wishes in like manner when the good old servant of abraham had arrived at the city of nahor to find a wife for his masters son we have him desiring of god that the sign of the woman he should pitch upon might be her saying drink and i will give thy camels drink also genesis xxiv    ana he said o lord god of my master abraham i pray thee send me good speed this day and show kindness unto my master abraham behold i stand here by the well of water and the daughters of the men of the city came out to draw water and let it come to pass that the damsel to whom i shall say let down thy pitcher i pray thee that i may drink and she shall say drink and i will give thy camels drink also let the same be she that thou have appointed for thy servant isaac and thereby shall i know that thou have showed kindness unto my master this happened according to his prayer by which he knew that the lord had prospered his journey now this custom we know the philistines imitated when they would know whether they had been afflicted by the god of israel for keeping the ark sam i     they took the ark of the lord and laid it on a cart and sent it away and they said if it goes by the way of his own coast to bethshemoth then he has done us this great evil  in these early ages of the world god permitted such things upon extraordinary occasions to be asked by his own people but they were only peculiar to those times we have no warrant for doing the like it becomes not us to prescribe means to god by which we may judge of our future success but to depend on his power and wisdom his care and providence the observation of omens such as the falling of salt a hare crossing the way of the deadwatch of crickets etc are sinful and diabolical they are the inventions of the devil to draw men from a due trust in god and make them his own vassals for by such observations as these they are the slaves of superstition and sin and have all the while no true dependence upon god no trust in his providence  observations on chapter ix various are the popular superstitions with regard to omens  to these our author has hinted at many more may be added  the breaking a looking glass is accounted a very unlucky accident  mirrors were formerly used by magicians in their superstitious and diabolical operations and there was an ancient kind of divination by the looking glass see the greek scholia on the nubes of aristophanes p     hence it should seem the present popular notion  when our cheek burns or ear tingles we usually say somebody is talking of us  a conceit of great antiquity and ranked among superstitious opinions by pliny absentes tinnitu aurium praesentire sermones de se receptum est  thus also the distich noted by dalecampius garrula quid totis resonas mihi noctibus auris nescio quem dicis nunc meminisse mei   moresin enumerates some of these superstitious omens  the croaking of ravens the hooting of owls the unseasonable meeting with cocks the hornedness of the moon the cloudy rising of the sun the shooting of stars the coming in and going out of strange cats the sudden fall of hens from the housetop etc  corvorum crocitatum super tecto bubonum bubulatum in transitu gallorum gallinaceorum cucurritum intempestivum  lunae corniculationem solis nubilum ortum stellarum trajectiones in aere  felium peregrinarum egressum ingressum  gallinarum subitum e tecto casum stupent etc deprav rel orig p        dr brown supposes this to have proceeded from the notion of a signifying genius or universal mercury that conducted sounds to their distant subjects and taught to hear by touch  it is accounted unlucky to destroy swallows  this is probably a pagan relic we read in aelian that these birds were sacred to the penates or household gods of the ancients and therefore were preserved they were honored anciently as the nuncios of the spring  the rhodians are said to have had a solemn anniversary song to welcome in the swallow see anacreons ode to that bird  i think it is mr addison that supposes the popular ballad of the babes in the wood to have preserved the lives of many robin redbreasts the subsequent stanza places them in a very favorable point of view no burial this pretty pair of any man receives till robinredbreast painfully did cover them with leaves vide dr percys collect ballads  the ancient augurs foretold things to come by the chirping or singing of certain birds the ancient britons made use of the hare for the purposes of divination they were never killed for the table it is perhaps from hence that they have been accounted ominous by the vulgar caesar p     the crow the pie the chough

p   0   it is vulgarly thought unlucky to kill spiders  can this be in support of the scotch proverb dirt bodes luck however this be it serves in many places for an apology for the laziness of housewives in not destroying the cobwebs this is also transmitted from the magicians of ancient rome see plinys natural history  presages and prognostications were made from their manner of weaving

whatever passage presented itself first to the eye constituted a kind of answer by oracle it was called the sorts homericae and sorts virgilianae  the superstitious among the ancient christians practiced a similar kind of divination by opening the old or new testament mr pennant gives us an account of another sort of divination used in scotland called reading the speal bone or the bladebone of a shoulder of mutton well scraped mr shaw says picked no iron must touch it vide tacit annal     when lord london he says was obliged to retreat before the rebels to the isle of sky a common

in the houses are rekindled from the forced fire all this too he tells us he has seen done and has no doubt of its being a druid custom  mr shaw further tells us that the ancient scots much regarded omens upon an expedition an armed man meeting them was a good omen  if a woman barefoot crossed the road before them they seized her and fetched blood from her forehead  if a deer fox hare or any beast of game appeared and they did not kill it it was an unlucky omen spitting according to pliny was superstitiously observed in averting witchcraft and in giving a shrewder blow to an enemy hence

the country conversation in a winters evening their opinions of spirits and apparitions of the devils appearing with a cloven foot of fairies and hobgoblins of the walking places of spirits and of haunted houses nothing is commoner in country places than for a whole family in a winters evening to sit round the fire and tell stories of apparitions and ghosts and no question of it but this adds to the natural fearfulness of men and makes them many times imagine they see things which really are nothing but their own fancy from this and seldom any other cause it is that herds and shepherds have all of them seen frequent apparitions and are generally so well stocked with stories of their own knowledge some of them have seen fairies some spirits in the shapes of cows and dogs and horses and some have seen even the devil himself with a cloven foot all which is either hearsay or a strong imagination not that there have not been or may not be apparitions we know that there have undoubtedly been such things and that there still are upon partilar occasions but that almost all the stories of ghosts and spirits are grounded on no other bottom than the fears and fancies and weak brains of men  in their account of the apparition of the devil they always describe him with a cloven foot that is always his distinguishing badge whatever shape he appears in whether it be in beauty or deformity he never appears without it such is the old tradition they have received of his appearing and such is their belief of it  indeed it must be confessed that this is not so improbable and ridiculous as many things they hold for though perhaps few of them have ought else for this opinion but old wives fables or the picture of the devil which they have always observed drawn with a cloven foot yet there seems to be some truth in it for in the times of frequent apparitions the devil was wont to appear so if we may believe antiquity and there is also some reason for it considering the circumstances of the fallen angels  the browns vulg err author of the vulgar errors upon this same subject has these words the ground of this opinion at first might be his frequent appearing in the shape of a goat which answers this description this was the opinion of the ancient christians concerning the apparitions of panites fauns and satyrs and of this form we read of one that appeared to anthony in the wilderness the same is also confirmed from expositions of holy scripture for whereas it is said thou shall not offer unto devils the original word is seghnirim that is rough and hairy goats because in that shape the devil most often appeared as is expounded by the rabbis as tremellius has also explained and as the word ascimah the god of emath is by some conceived he observes also that the goat was the emblem of the sin offering and is the emblem of sinful men at the day of judgment  and of this opinion was also the learned mr mede dis  0 mede he says that when spirits converse with men it is under some visible shape and that there is a law given them that that shape they assumed should be of something which more or less resembled their condition for as in nature we see every thing has a several and suitable physiognomy or figure as a badge of their inward nature whereby it is known as by a habit of distinction so it seems to be in the shapes and apparitions of spirits and as in a well governed common wealth every sort and condition is known by a differing habit agreeable to his quality so it seems it should be in gods great common wealth concerning the shapes which spirits take upon them and he that gave the law that a man should not wear the habit of a woman nor a woman the habit of a man because that as he had made them diverse so would he have them so known by their habits so it seems he will not suffer a good and a bad spirit a noble and ignoble one to appear unto man after the same fashion  now from this it will follow that good angels can take upon them no other shape but the shape of man because their glorious excellency is resembled only in the most excellent of all visible creatures the shape of an inferior creature would be unsuitable no other shape becoming those who are called the sons of god but his only who was created after gods own image and yet not his neither as he now is but according as he was before his fall in his glorious beauty of his integrity age and deformity are the fruits of sin and the angel in the gospel appears like a young man his matthew xxviii countenance like lightning and his raiment white as snow as it were resembling the beauty of glorified bodies in immutability sublimity and purity  hence also it follows on the contrary that the devil could not appear in humane shape whilst man was in his integrity because he was a spirit fallen from his first glorious perfection and therefore must appear in such shape which might argue his imperfection and abasement which was the shape of a beast otherwise no reason can be given why he should not rather have appeared to eve in the shape of a woman than of a serpent for so he might have gained an opinion with her both of more excellency and knowledge but since the fall of man the case is altered now we know he can take upon him the shape of man and no wonder since one falling star may resemble another and therefore he appears it seems in the shape of mans imperfection either for age or deformity as like an old man for so the witches say and perhaps it is not altogether false which is vulgarly affirmed that the devil appearing in humane shape has always a deformity of some uncouth member or other as though he could not yet take upon him humane shape entirely for that man himself is not entirely and utterly fallen as he is  thus far has this great and learned man given his opinion of this matter and that with such strength of reason and argument as leaves at least a probability behind it of the truth of this opinion  another part of this conversation generally turns upon fairies these they tell you have frequently been heard and seen nay that there are some still living who were stolen away by them and confined seven years according to the description they give of them who pretend to have seen them they are in the shape of men exceeding little they are always clad in green and frequent the woods and fields when they make cakes which is a work they have been often heard at they are very noisy and when they have done they are full of mirth and pastime but generally they dance in moonlight when mortals are asleep and not capable of seeing them as may be observed on the following morn their dancing places being very distinguishable for as they dance hand in hand and so make a circle in their dance so next day there will be seen rings and circles on the grass  now in all this there is really nothing but an old fabulous story which has been handed down even to our days from the times of heathenism of a certain sort of beings called lamiae which were esteemed so mischievous and cruel as to take away young children and slay them these together with the the fauns the gods of the woods seem to have formed the notion of fairies  this opinion in the benighted ages of popery when hobgoblins and sprights were in every city and town and village by every water and in every wood was very common but when that cloud was dispelled and the day sprung up those spirits which wandered in the night of ignorance and error did really vanish at the dawn of truth and the light of knowledge  another tradition they hold and which is often talked of is that there are particular places allotted to spirits to walk in thence it was that formerly such frequent reports were abroad of this and that particular place being haunted by a spirit and that the common people say now and then such a place is dangerous to be passed through at night because a spirit walks there nay they will further tell you that some spirits have lamented the hardness of their condition in being obliged to walk in cold and uncomfortable places and have therefore desired the person who was so hardy as to speak to them to gift them with a warmer walk by some well grown hedge or in some shady vale where they might be sheltered from the rain and wind  the stories that apparitions have been seen oftener than once in the same place have no doubt been the rise and spring of the walking places of spirits but why they are said sometimes to cry out for places that are more comfortable is not so certainly known it is however highly probable that when the ignorance and superstition of the romish church had filled the world with apparitions and ghosts that this also was invented among them for they seem to have the most right to an invention of this nature whose brains were so fruitful of folly as to invent that fullers chapter hist cen  0 dunstan took the devil by the nose with a pair of hot tongs till he roared again for if the devil may be burnt he may also be starved if he took such pains to get his nose out of the pincers without doubt in a frosty night he would wish to be as warm as possible he that believes the one must necessarily believe the other and therefore it very near amounts to a demonstration who were the authors of this opinion viz the monks we are sure they invented the one and need little question but they invented the other  there is a story in the book of tobit which they may believe that will of the evil spirits flying into the utmost parts of egypt tob vi for as tobias went in unto his wife he remembered the words of raphael and took the ashes of the perfumes and put the heart and liver of the fish thereupon and made a smoke therewith the which smell when the evil spirit had smelled he fled unto the utmost parts of egypt and the angel bound him now from this it is evident that the spirit was obliged to forsake his good old quarters and warm lodgings for inhospitable deserts and open air and from this perhaps some of those doting monks have persuaded themselves into a belief of these things  when it is proved to us that this book of tobit is the word of god we may entertain more veneration for this vulgar opinion but till then we must be indulged in wondering how a spirit that is an immaterial substance can be affected with our heat or cold or any power or quality of material beings  the last topic of this conversation i shall take notice of shall be the tales of haunted houses and indeed it is not to be wondered at that this is never omitted for formerly almost every place had a house of this kind if a house was seated on some melancholy place or built in some old romantic manner or if any particular accident had happened in it such as murder sudden death or the like to be sure that house had a mark set on it and was afterward esteemed the habitation of a ghost in talking upon this point they generally show the occasion of the houses being haunted the merry pranks of the spirit and how it was laid stories of this kind are infinite and there are few villages which have not either had such an house in it or near it  and indeed there are men of good learning and knowledge who are as far as others from superstition who are inclinable to believe that such things have been upon particular emergencies though among the stories that are told they believe not one in a thousand they know that spirits have frequently appeared to men out of houses and they can see no reason why they may not have appeared in them they know nothing in an house more than in another place to prevent an apparition but an equal help to its visibility the air which a ghost is supposed to be wrapped in when it becomes visible to men is there to be found and they know of nothing else that may be an argument against it an author of good credit tells us cum romae aegra valetudine oppressus forem jaceremque in lectulo speciem mulieris eleganti forma mihi plane vigilanti observatam fuisse quam cum inspicerem diu cogitabundus etc  cum meos sensus vigere and figuram illam nusquam a me dilabi etc alex ab alex lib   c   that when he was at rome he was taken with illness and obliged to keep his bed as he lay in this condition he observed as he was once awake a woman of a very beautiful person coming toward him upon this he was silent for some time and very thoughtful weighing all the while with himself whether it was not rather a deceptio visus than a real being but when he perceived his senses sound and entire and that the object still continued he asked what she was in answer to which she repeated the very words he had spoken to her in a sneering and disdainful manner after she had taken a good view of him she departed  the commentator upon this place says sed haec semper mera somnia esse putavi ibid he looks upon this story and the rest which are mentioned along with it to be nothing but dreams and fancies and for ought that i know to the contrary they may be so but however it must be confessed this story in particular is well attested being told by the man himself who was a great and a learned man and who if we may believe himself seems to be as sure that he had his eyes open as the commentator can be of the contrary  but whatever truth there may be in it it is certain that in the church of rome they are persuaded of the truth of it to a fault for they are so sure of it that they have particular forms of exorcising such houses which because they have often been heard of but seldom seen and are those very things which raised in the vulgar formerly such an opinion of their ignorant priests as to make them be esteemed men of the greatest faith and learning and because also the opinion has reached even our days and it is common for the present vulgar to say none can lay a spirit but a popish priest it shall be the business of the next chapter to give one of those forms of exorcising an house not that they are envied for their art of conjuring but that it may be seen how well they deserve the character they go under  observations on chapter x of such a winterevenings confabulation as our

reasons that lead to the confirmation of this suspicion  taking this for granted it was a great and unpardonable foible in one of so exalted an understanding false shame was perhaps never more strongly exemplified the learned world will forgive me for attempting in this note to defeat his very narrow purpose for i can call by no softer name the wishing to conceal from posterity a circumstance that would by no means have lessened his fame with them i flatter myself it is compatible with the respect we owe to the dead and even to the memory of him who on other accounts deserved

propriety of this reasoning can only be felt by philosophical spirits the world wisely on its own account reprobates such doctrine yet while others are boasting with the roman governor of old that

believe ever came nearer to it in this than i have done    etc from the subsequent passage in shakespeare the walking of spirits seems to have been enjoined by way of penance the ghost speaks thus in hamlet i am thy fathers spirit doomed for a certain time to walk the night and for the day confined to fast in fires till the soul crimes done in my days of nature are burnt and purged away   mr gay in imitation of the style of our old ennius gives us a fine description of one of these haunted houses  now there spreaden a rumor that everich night the rooms ihaunted been by many a sprite the miller avoucheth and all thereabout that they full often hearen the hellish rout some saine they hear the gingling of chains and some has heard the psautries strains at midnight some the heedless horse imeet and some espien a corse in a white sheet the learned moresin traces thus to its origin the popish superstition relative to the coming again as it is commonly called or walking of spirits

in mr addisons comedy of the drummer or the haunted house it will be thought much to our purpose  gardener i marvel john how he the spirit gets into the house when all the gates are shut   butler why look ye peter your spirit will creep you into an augre hole  he will whisk ye through a keyhole without so much as justling against one of the wards   coachman i believe i saw him last night in the town close   guard ay how did he appear   coach like a white horse   but pho robin i tell ye he has never appeared yet but in the shape of the sound of a drum   coach this makes one almost afraid of ones own shadow as i was walking from the stable the other night without my lanthorn i fell across a beam  and thought i had stumbled over a spirit   but thou might as well have stumbled over a straw why a spirit is such a little little thing that i have heard a man who was a great scholar say that he will dance ye a lancashire hornpipe upon the point of a needle  as i sat in the pantry last night the candle methought burnt blue and the spayd bitch looked as if she saw something   guard ay i warrant ye she hears him many a time and often when we dont   thus also in another scene  guard prythee john what sort of a creature is a conjurer   but why he is made much as other men are if it was not for his long gray beard  his beard is at least half a yard long he is dressed in a strange dark cloak as black as a coal  he has a long white wand in his hand   coach i fancy it is made out of witch elm   guard i warrant you if the ghost appears he will whisk ye that wand before his eyes and strike you the drumstick out of his hand   but no the wand look ye is to make a circle and if he once gets the ghost in a circle then he has him  a circle you must know is a conjurers trap   coach but what will he do with him when he has him there   but why then he will overpower him with his learning   guard if he can once compass him and get him in lobspound he will make nothing of him but speak a few hard words to him and perhaps bind him over to his good behavior for a thousand years   coach ay ay he will send him packing to his grave again with a flea in his ear i warrant him   but if the conjurer be but well paid he will take pains upon the ghost and lay him look ye in the red sea  and then he is laid for ever   guard why john there must be a power of spirits in that same red sea  i warrant ye they are as plenty as fish  i wish the spirit may not carry a corner of the house off with him   but as for that peter you may be sure that the steward has made his bargain with the cunning man beforehand that he shall stand to all costs and damages   the above is a pleasant comment on the popular creed concerning spirits and haunted houses  i am pleased with mr bournes zeal for the honor of his protestant brethren at the conclusion of this chapter  the vulgar he says think them no conjurers and say none can lay a spirit but popish priests  he wishes to undeceive them however and to prove at least negatively that our own clergy know full as much of the black art as the others do  here follows the tedious process for the expulsion of doemons who it should seem have not been easily ferretted out of their quarters if one may judge of their unwillingness to depart by the prolixity of the subsequent removal warrant which i suppose the romish clerical bailiffs were not at the

when thou come in if thou find not that bell has eaten up all we will suffer death or else daniel that speaks against us and they little regarded it for under the table they had made a privy entrance whereby they entered in continually and consumed those things so when they were gone forth the king set meats before bell now daniel had commanded his servants to bring ashes and those they strewed throughout all the temple in the presence of the king alone then went they out and shut the door and sealed it with the kings signet and so departed now in the night came the priests with their wives and children as they were wont to do and did eat and drink up all in the morning betime the king arose and daniel with him and the king said daniel are the seals whole and daniel said yea o king they be whole and as soon as he had opened the door the king looked upon the table and cried with a loud voice great art thou o bell and with thee there is no deceit at all then daniel laughed and told the king that he should not go in and said behold now the pavement and mark well whose footsteps are these and the king said i see the footsteps of men women and children and then the king was angry and took the priests with their wives and children who showed him the privy doors where they came in and consumed such things as were upon the table therefore the king slew them and delivered bell into

the holy spirit god world without end amen  the office on sunday on sunday after the priest has placed himself in one of the largest and most sumptuous parts of the house he shall direct this exorcism to the demons that haunt it saying  i exorcise you o ye demons who have thus boldly presumed to invade this habitation of men and give such disquietude to its inhabitants by the triune god whose is the earth and the fullness thereof the round world and they that dwell therein by our lord jesus christ who continuing what he was made himself man conceived by the holy ghost and born of a virgin and who for our sakes when he had undergone many sufferings underwent also the torment of the cruel cross upon which he bowed his head and gave up the ghost that he might obtain for us abundant grace in the present life and in the world to come life everlasting by all the grace acquired for us by the grace of faith conferred in baptism of fortitude in confirmation of charity in the eucharist of justice in penance of hope in extreme unction of temperance in matrimony and of prudence in holy orders and by all holy men and women the saints of god who now inherit eternal glory and by all their merits that you remove this your presumptuous power from this house and continue here no longer nor any more vex its inhabitants  then let him exorcise the whole house by saying  i exorcise this house which was built for the use of humane kind by the father son and holy ghost the omnipotent god who built the house of the whole world for man and put all things in it in subjection under his feet and by christ our lord who is the fountain of all grace and the origin of all virtue by his unparalled poverty of which he truly said the foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests but the son of man has not where to lay his head by his meekness he himself saying of it learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart by his weeping when he beheld the city jerusalem and wept over it saying if thou had known by the hunger and thirst of his righteousness saying my meat is to do the will of my father which is in heaven by his mercy which excited him to say i will have mercy and not sacrifice by his purity of heart of which he could say be ye holy for i am holy by the peace which he always loved as at the last he showed when he said peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you and by that persecution which he suffered for righteousness sake which he himself attests saying if they have persecuted me they will also persecute you and by the holy apostles and by the effusion of their blood and by all holy men and holy women that thou may be blessed and obtain from god above such virtue by our ministry that thou may become to the evil spirits a new hell and a burning furnace of eternal horror so that they may flee from every corner and leave thee entirely free that thou may become a comfortable habitation for men and that god may ever be glorified  after that let him bless the house in the following manner  v o lord hear my prayer  r and let my cry come unto thee  v he has blessed the house of israel  r he has blessed the house of aaron  mac b   c    thou o lord of all things who have need of nothing wast pleased that the temple of thine habitation should be among us and therefore now o holy lord of all holiness keep this house ever undefiled which lately was cleansed and grant unto us the abundance of thy goodness that this house may be blessed and sanctified of thee by our ministry that the evil angels may abdicate it and it may be a protection for the faithful a pure habitation for the holy angels and a possession always worthy of thy care through our lord jesus christ thy son who lives and reigns with thee in the unity of the holy spirit god who shall come to judge the quick and dead and the world by fire amen  then let the image of our savior upon the cross he erected in an open part of the principal room in the house and let the priest sprinkle the whole house with holy water from top even to the bottom saying  the lesson st luke chap xix and jesus entered and passed through jericho and behold there was a man named zaccheus which was the chief among the publicanes and he was rich and he sought to see jesus who he was and he could not for the press because he was little of stature and he ran before and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him for he was to pass that way and when jesus came to the place he looked up and saw him and said unto him zaccheus make haste and come down for to day i must abide at thy house and he made haste and came down and received him joyfully and when they saw it they all murmured saying that he was gone to be a guest with a man that is a sinner and zaccheus stood and said unto the lord behold lord the half of my goods i give to the poor and if i have taken any thing of any man by false accusation i restore him fourfold and jesus said unto him this day is salvation come to this house forasmuch as he also is the son of abraham for the son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost  when all these things are done let abyssum which is a kind of an herb be procured and after it is signed with the sign of the cross let it be hung up at the four corners of the house  i suppose the reason of proceeding after this manner day by day is that the devil may be gradually banished and to be sure what is observed on the last of the days viz the ordering of the crucifix the holy water the abyssum tied to the four corners of the house is to keep the devil out when he is out  st austin tells us a story of one vir  hesperitius  ubi  domum suam spirituum maiignorum vim noxiam perpeti comperisset rogavit nostros me absente presbyteros ut aliquis eorum illo pergeret cujus orationibus cederent perrexit unus obtulit ibi sacrificium corporis christi orans quantum potuit ut cessaret illa vexatio deo protinus miserante cessarit aug de civit dei lib    cap   hesperitius whose house was troubled with evil spirits who came once in his absence to his presbyters and begged their assistance upon which one of them went along with him and when he had offered the sacrifice of the body of christ and prayed in a most fervent manner the house by the mercy of god was no longer troubled  here is indeed an account of a house being haunted but not a word of any such order in the dispossessing it the priest goes immediately over the threshold into the troubled apartment and expells the spirits by his prayers had such forms been customary in the days of st austin had the crucifix holy water and abyssum been used no question but here or somewhere else we should have had some account of it but these ages were unacquainted with such whimsical forms of exorcising and if the story be true it was nothing but prayer that quieted the house it is ridiculous to suppose that the prince of darkness will yield to such feeble instruments as water and herbs and crucifixes these weapons are not spiritual but carnal whereas in resisting this potent enemy we must put on the whole armor of god that we may be able to resist him which is such a composition as is entirely free from the least allay or mixture of any such superstitions  observations on chapter xi i find little that may be added concerning the exorcising haunted houses a species of the black art which is now almost forgotten in this kingdom perhaps the form is worth preserving as a curiosity as we hang up rusty pieces of old armor a proof how much ado there may have been about nothing and yet it may be supposed not altogether for nothing either  st chrysostom is said to have insulted some african conjurers of old with this humiliating and singular observation miserable and woeful creatures that we are we cannot so much as expel fleas much less devils obsession of the devil is distinguished from possession in this in possession the evil one was said to enter into the body of the man  in obsession without entering into the body of the person he was thought to besiege and torment him without  to be lifted up into the air and afterward to be thrown down on the ground violently without receiving any hurt  to speak strange languages that the person had never learned  not to be able to come near holy things or the sacraments but to have an aversion to them  to know and foretell secret things  to perform things that exceed the persons strength  to say or do things that the person would not or durst not say if he were not externally moved to it were the ancient marks and criterions of obsession  calmet in baileys dict the old vulgar ceremonies used in raising the devil such as making a circle with chalk setting an old hat in the center of it repeating the lords prayer backwards etc etc are now altogether obsolete and seem to be forgotten even amongst our boys  none will desire to see them revived amongst them yet it were to be wished that many of these little gentry had not substituted the doing things really bad for this seemingly profane but truly ridiculous mode or rather mockery of the ancient magical incantation     the learned seldom observes on this occasion that there was never a merry world since the fairies left dancing and the parson left conjuring i subjoin a very pertinent quotation from the learned author of the origin and increase of depravity in religion  apud tum poetas tum historiographos de magicis incantationibus exorcismis et curatione tum hominum quam belluarum per carmina haud pauca habentur sed horum impietatem omnium superat long hac in re papismus  hic enim supra dei potestatem posse carmina posse exorcismos affirmat  ita ut nihil sit tam obstrusum in coelis quod exorcismis non pateat nihil tam abditum in inferno quod non eruatur

demon non ejiciatur moresini deprav rel orig p    pliny tells us that houses were anciently hallowed against evil spirits with brimstone this charm has been converted by later times into what our satyrist churchill in his prophecy of famine calls a precious and rare medicine and is now used but i suppose with greater success in exorcising those of our unfortunate fellow creatures who are haunted or possessed with a certain fiery spirit said by the wits of the south to be well known seen and felt and very troublesome in the north     the opinion of the latter kept thieves in awe and did as much good in a country as a justice of peace  this facetious and pointedly sensible writer enquires farther why have we now none possessed with devils in england the old answer is the devil has the protestants already and the papists are so holy he dares not meddle with them  casting out devils he adds is mere juggling they never cast out any but what they first cast in they do it where for reverence no man shall dare to examine it they do it in a corner in a morticehole not in the marketplace they do nothing but what may be done by art they make the devil fly out of the window in the likeness of a bat or a rat why do they not hold him why in the likeness of a bat or a rat or some creature that is why not in some shape we paint him in with claws and horns answer may be made to his pertinent question that real bats and rats may be procured  but every carver is not to be trusted with the making of a horned or clovenfooted image of the devil  impious and antichristian rome in an age when every wretched sophister drawing his conclusions from false premises wishes to confound the pure spirit of christian philosophy with these and the like adulterations of it i must at least be pardoned for obtruding the subsequent eulogy extracted from an old tragedy  no professed divine has perhaps ever exhibited more forcibly the grandeur and utility of christianity than these few lines do if these are christian virtues i am christian the faith that can inspire this generous change must be divine  and glows with all its god friendship and constancy and right and pity all these were lessons i had learned before but this unnatural grandeur of the soul is more than mortal and outreaches virtue it draws it charms it binds me to be christian hills alzira    it is impossible to say how much thou have prejudiced the cause of manly and rational religion by these and the like thy childish to give no harsher name to thy fooleries and superstitions  chap xii of saturday afternoon how observed of old by the ancient christians the church of scotland and the old church of england what end we should observe it for an exhortation to the observation of it it is usual in country places and villages where the politeness of the age has made no great conquest to observe some particular times with some ceremonies which were customary in the days of our forefathers such are the great festivals of christmas easter and several others which they observe with rites and customs appropriated to them  among these we find a great deference paid to saturday afternoon above the other worky days of the week then the labors of the plough ceast and refreshment and ease are over all the village  this seems to be the remains of a laudable custom once in this land but now almost buried in that general contempt of religion and love of the world which prevail so much every where of attending the evening prayers on saturday and laying aside the concerns of this life to be fitter for the duties of the day following for baily prac piety p     it was an holy custom among our forefathers when at the ringing to prayer the eve before the sabbath the husbandman would give over his labor in the field and the tradesman his work in the shop and go to evening prayer in the church to prepare their souls that their minds might more cheerfully attend gods worship on the sabbath day  and indeed it was the custom both of the jewish and the christian church they neither of them entered upon the sabbath without some preparation for it moses exodus xvi mark xiv taught the jews to remember the sabbath over night from whence in all probability it comes to pass that the eve of the jewish sabbath is called the preparation the preparation mentioned by the evangelists begun at three a clock on friday afternoon it was proclaimed with the noise of trumpets and horns that they might be better put in mind of the sabbaths drawing on and of that preparation which was requisite for it  among the primitive christians the lords day was always ushered in with a pernoctation or vigil they assembled in the house of god and sung psalms and praises to him a great part of the night that they might be better prepared to serve him on his own day following  in the year of our lord   0  william king of scotland in scotia anno salutis   0  gulielmus rex primorum regni sui concilium cogit cui etiam interfuit pontificius legatus in quo decretum est ut saturni dies abhora    meridiei sacer esset neque quisquam res profanas exerceret quemadmodum aliis quoque festis diebus vetitum id erat idque campanae pulsu populo indicaretur ac postea sacris rebus ut diebus festis operam darint concionibus interessent vesperas audirent idque in diem lunae facerent constituta transgressoribus gravi paena boet lib    de scot ex hospin p     called a council of the chief men of his kingdom at which also was present the popes legate and it was then determined that saturday after the twelfth hour should be kept holy that no one should follow their business nor callings but desist as on other holy days that they should be put in mind of it by the tolling of the bell and then mind the business of religion as on holy days be present at the sermon and hear vespers that this should be the practice till monday morning and whoever acted otherwise should be severely punished  and this as is said before was also the custom of our own country long before this ordered in scotland for in the year     when king edgar made his ecclesiastical laws we find one made to this very purpose in which it is ordered that dies sabbati ab ipsa diei saturni hora pomeridiana tertia usque in luminarii diei diluculum festus agitator etc seld analect angl lib   cap   the sabbath or sunday shall be observed from saturday at mr johnson upon this law says that the noontide signifies three in the afternoon according to our present account and this practice i conceive continued down to the reformation in king winfreds time the lords day did not begin till sunset on the saturday see     numb  0 three in the afternoon was hora nona in the latin account and therefore called noon how it came afterward to signify midday i can but guess the monks by their rules could not eat their dinner till they had said their noon song which was a service regularly to be said at three a clock but they probably anticipated their devotions and their dinner by saying their noon song immediately after their midday song and presently falling on i wish they had never been guilty of a worse fraud than this but it may fairly be supposed that when midday became the time of dining and saying noon song it was for this reason called noon by the monks who were the masters of the language during the dark ages in the shepherds almanac noon is mid day highnoon three a clock johnson constable part   ann     noon till the light appear on monday morning  now hence has come the present custom of spending a part of saturday afternoon without servile labor and that our forefathers when the bell was heard attended the evening prayer not fearing the loss of time nor the necessities of poverty happy would it be for us would we so banish the care of the body for the care of the soul would we leave to converse about secular business and mind then the business of religion would we remember that it is luke xxiii    the preparation and that the sabbath draws on  when jacob was going to worship god at bethel he ordered his family to genesis xxxv   put away the strange gods that were among them and be clean and change their garments and arise and go to bethel he knew that the god of purity and holiness was to be approached with the utmost purity they could possibly cloth themselves with and would we before we enter into the presence of god on his own day endeavor to purify our selves from the filth of the world we have contracted in the days before would we disperse these busy swarms of things which so attract our minds and prepare our selves for the following day we should appear before god less earthly and more heavenly less sinful and more holy our psalm cxliv   prayers would be set forth in his sight as the incense and the lifting up of our hands be an evening sacrifice and like the smell of jacobs garment in the nostrils of his father the smell of our prayers would genesis xxvii    be like the smell of a field which the lord has blessed  and now what is this preparation but the trimming of our lamps against we meet the lord on the next day our bodies should be refreshed by ceasing early from their labor that they may be active and vigorous and our souls washed with sobriety and temperance and the private or public prayer of the evening thus should we meet the lord at bethel and obtain those mercies we sought of him there  art thou then blessed with an affluence of things and has providence placed thee above the careful sations of life what reason then can be sufficient for thy neglect of this custom for neither can thou plead the want of time neither do thou dread the straits of poverty  or art thou involved in the cares of business do thou earn thy bread by the sweat of thy face and the labors of thy hands o well is thee and happy may thou be would thou dedicate this small time to the service of god it would be like the widows mite which was more than all that was thrown into the treasury but perhaps thou will say thou art under the yoke subject to servitude and obliged to work even to the latter end of the day it may be so but yet as god is every where present so would thou remember that it is the preparation and put up an ejaculation at thy work god would accept it and it would prove to thee an equal good with the other preparation cassian haec officia

religious offices and st jerome when he is commending the pleasing retirement of the village of bethlehem in christi villa tuta rusticitas est extra psalmos silentium est quocunque te verteris arator stiuam retinens alleluia decantatur sudns messor psalmis se advocat etc hierom ep    ad marcel says that in the village of christ there is a secure rusticity no noise is heard there but the singing of psalms wheresoever you go you have either the ploughman singing hallelujahs as he is holding the plough or the sweating mower pleasing himself with hymns or the vinedresser singing davids psalms these without doubt were acceptable to god and thine undoubtedly will be acceptable also  but if thou art not tied down by necessity do not say that the common necessaries of life require then thy labor for this is not losing but redeeming the time what thou spendest in the care of thy soul is not lost in the care of thy body never was man poorer for observing the duties of religion if thou lose any thing of the wages of the day to do the service of god he will take care to supply it thou shall be no loser  why then art thou fearful o thou of little faith why do thou take so much thought for thy life behold the fowls of the air for they sow not neither do they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly father feeds them art thou not much better than they and why take thou thought for raiment consider the lilies of the field they toil not neither do they spin and yet i say unto thee that solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these and shall he not much more cloth thee o thou of little faith therefore take no thought for what thou shall eat or what thou shall drink or where withal thou shall be clothed but seek thou first the kingdom of god and his righteousness prefer the care of these to the care of all other things and all these things shall be added unto thee  let not then the busy cares of this life be any hinderance to thy care of the

undisturbed quiet of the other life  observations on chapter xii the religious observation of the saturday afternoon is now entirely at an end i should be happy were i able to say with truth that the conclusion of that of the sunday too did not seem to be approaching  mr bourne uses great affectation in translating the quotation from seldom he has printed the latin erroneously too it ought to be in lunaris diei diliculum etc  the sabbath was not to be observed from saturday at noon but from three oclock on that day in the afternoon and whatever part of the day might have been called noon at the time he alludes to he might have hinted to us in a note without confounding it in his text with the midday of this age  to our authors account of the custom of the old churches of england and scotland an alteration may be added of which he seems never to have heard it is that in the year      at a provincial council held by archbishop mepham at magfield after complaint made that instead of fasting upon the vigils they ran out to all the excesses of riot etc it was appointed among many other things relative to holy days that the solemnity for sunday should begin upon saturday in the evening and not before to prevent the misconstruction of keeping a judaical sabbath mr wheatly tells us that in the east the church thought sit to indulge the humor of the judaizing christians so far as to observe the saturday as a festival day of devotion and thereon to meet for the exercise of religious duties  as is plain from several passages of the ancients illustration of common prayer p      see colliers ecclesiastic hist vol i p      our authors exhortation toward the conclusion of this chapter is i think liable to misconstruction an inference might easily be deduced from it in favor of idleness  perhaps men who live by manual labor or have families to support by it cannot better spend their saturday afternoon than in following the several callings in which they have employed themselves on the preceding days of the week  industry will be no bad preparation to the sabbath  considered in a political view much harm has been done by that prodigal waste of days very falsely called holy days in the church of rome they have greatly favored the cause of vice and dissipation without doing any essential service to that of rational religion  complaints seem to have been made in almost every synod and council of the licentiousness introduced by the keeping of vigils  nor will the philosopher wonder at this for it has its foundation in the nature of things for the honor of human nature which like the majestic ruins of palmyra though prostrate in the dust is still respectable in its decay i forbear to translate the subsequent quotation from dr moresin et videre contigit

always observed as the lords day was and was in like manner preceded by an eve or vigil hence it is that our church has ordered an eve before it which is observed by the religious as a day of preparation for that great festival  our forefathers when the common devotions of the eve were over and night was come on were wont to light up candles of an uncommon size which were called christmascandles and to lay a log of wood upon the fire which they termed a yuleclog or christmasblock these were to illuminate the house and turn the night into day which custom in some measure is still kept up in the northern parts  it has in all probability been derived from the saxons forbid tells us that this very night was observed in this land before by the heathen saxons they incipiebant autem annum ab octavo calendarum januarii die ubi nunc natale domini celebramus and ipsam noctem nuuc nobis sacrosanctam tunc gentili vocabulo maedrenack i e matrum noctem appellabant ob causam ut suspicamur ceremoniarum quas in ea pervigiles agebant beda de rat temp cap    began says he their year on the eight of the calends of january which is now our christmas day and the very night before which is now holy to us was by them called maedrenack or the night of mothers because as we imagine of those ceremonies which were performed that night the yuleclog therefore has probably been a part of that nights ceremonies the very name seems to speak it and tells its original to every age  it seems to have been used as an emblem of the return of the sun and the lengthening of the days for as december guili eodem quo januarius nomine vocatur  guili a conversione solis in auctum diei nomen accipit beda ibid both december and january were called guili or gehol or geol angl sax jol vel jul dan sax and to this day in the north yule you will signifies the solemn festival of christmas and were words used to denote a time of festivity very anciently and before the introduction of christianity among the northern nations learned men have disputed much about this word some deriving it from julius caesar others from the word gehthel a wheel as bede who would therefore have it so called because of the return of the suns annual course after the winter solitice but he writing de rat temp speaks rather as an astronomer than an aniry the best antiquaries derive it from the word ol ale which was much used in their festivities and merry meetings and the i in iol iul cimbr as the ge and gi in gehol geol giul sax are premised only as intensives to add a little to the signification and make it more emphatical ol or ale as has been observed did not only signify the liquor they made use of but gave denomination likewise to their greatest festivals as that of gehol or yule at midwinter and as is yet plainly to be discerned in that custom of the whitsanale at the other great festival elstob sax hom birth daygreg append p     bishop stillingfleet has also taken notice of this and says that some think the name of this feast was taken from iola which in the gothic language signifies to make merry but he seems not inclinable to this opinion and therefore tells us that olaus rudbeck thinks the former  viz its being called so from the joy that was conceived at the return of the sun more proper not only from bedes authority but because in the old runick fasti a wheel was used to denote that festival stilling orig britain   yule upon account of the suns returning and the increase of the days so i am apt to believe the log has had the name of the yulelog from its being burnt as an emblem of the returning sun and the increase of its light and heat  this was probably the reason of the custom among the heathen saxons but i cannot think the observation of it was continued for the same reason after christianity was embraced for bishop stillingfleet observes in his origines britanicae that though the ancient saxons observed twelve days at that time and sacrificed to the sun in hopes of his returning yet when christianity prevailed all these idolatrous sacrifices were laid aside and that time of feasting was joined with the religious solemnity of that season which in other parts of the world were observed by christians and in like manner as these days of feasting were joined with the religious solemnities of that season so the keeping up of this custom seems to have been done with another view than it was originally if a conjecture may be allowed it might have been done on account of our saviors birth which happened that night for as the burning of it before christianity was an emblem of the coming of the sun which they worshipped as their god so the continuing it after might have been for a symbol of that light which was that night born into the world the light that shines in darkness the light that lightened the gentiles that turned them from darkness to light and from the power of satan unto god  and indeed it will be some strengthening of the conjecture that light has been the emblem of several things both in scripture and in the ancient church for the scripture makes use of it and the church in imitation of the scripture as a lively reresentation of several things thus light is the emblem of god for god is light says the apostle st john john the baptist was a burning and a shining light and therefore in some places it feruntur quoque brandae seu faces ardentes and fiunt ignes qui significant sanctum joannem qui fuit lumen and lucerna ardens and praecedens and praecursor verae lucis quae illuminat omnem hominem venientem in hunc mundum durand rational lib   cap    nu    is customary to carry torches on st john the baptists eve to represent st john baptist himself who was a burning and a shining light and a preparer of the way for the true light that lighteneth every man that comes into the world the apostles were the light of the world and as our savior was frequently called light so was his coming into the world signified and pointed out by the emblems of light it was then says our countryman gregory the longest night in all the year and it was the midst of that and yet there was day where he was for a glorious and betokening light shined round about this holy child so says tradition and so the masters describe the night piece of the nativity if this be called in question as being only tradition it is out of dispute that the light which illuminated the fields of bethlehem and shone round about the shepherds as they were watching their flocks was an emblem of that light which was then come into the world what quid est quod apparenti angelo divinae quoque claritatis splendour eos circumdedit quod nunquam in tota testamenti veteris serie and reperimus cum tam innumeris vicibus angeli prophetis and justis apparuerunt nusquam eos fulgore divinae lucis homines circumdedisse legimus nisi quod hoc privilegium recte hujus temporis dignitati servatum est etc bed hyem de sanct in gal cant can be the meaning says venerable bede that this apparition of angels was surrounded with that heavenly light which is a thing we never meet with in all the old testament for though angels have appeared to prophets and holy men yet we never read of their appearing in such glory and splendour before it must surely be because this privilege was reserved for the dignity of this time for when the true light of the world was born in the world it was very proper that the proclaimer of his nativity should appear in the eyes of men in such an heavenly light as was before unseen in the world and that supernatural star which was the guide of the eastern magi was a figure of that star which was risen out of jacob of that light which should lighten the gentiles god says bishop tailor sent a miraculous star to invite and lead them to a new and more glorious light the light of grace and glory  in imitation of this as gregory tells us the church went on with the ceremony and hence it was that for the three or four first centuries the whole eastern church called the day which they observed for our saviors nativity the epiphany or manifestation of the light and cassian tells ut intra egypti regionem mos iste traditione antiqua servatur ut peracto epiphaniorum die etc cassian coll  0 c  0 that it was a custom in egypt handed down by tradition as soon as the epiphany or day of light was over etc hence also came that ancient custom of the same church taken notice of by st jerome of absque martyrum reliquiis per totas orientis ecclesias quum legendum est evangelium accenduntur luminaria jam sole rutilante non utique ad fugandas tenebras sed ad signum laetitiae demonstrandum etc jerome cont vigil cap   lighting up candles at the reading of the gospel even at noonday and that not to drive away the darkness but to speak their joy for the good tidings of the gospel and be an emblem of that light which the psalmist says was a lamp unto his feet and a light unto his paths  light therefore having been an emblem of so many things and particularly of our lord jesus christ both in the sacred history and in the practice of the church it is no way improbable that after their conversion the saxons used it as an emblem of him who that night came into the world and was the light thereof in the city of constantinople on the eve of easter there was a custom practiced much like this of ours on christmaseve for then the whole city was illuminated with tapers and torches which continued all the night turning the night into day till almost the day appeared the reason of this custom was to represent that light which the next day arose upon the world the difference between these two customs is that of the time the reason of their observation is much the same the one illuminated the eve of easter that there might be an emblem of the sun of righteousness who the next day arose upon the world the other the eve of yule to give an emblem of that light which was the day spring from on high nay this eve of yule as gregory tells us was illuminated with so many tapors among the ancients as to give to the vigil the name of vigilia luminum and the ancients says he did well to send lights one to another whatever some think of the christmascandle  eus vit constan cap    lib   observations on chapter xiii mr bourne omits the yuledough or dow a

alludes to this custom the birk meaning a block of the birch tree stripped of its bark and dried against yule even  it is spoken of one who is exceedingly poor   or block before candies this is merely conjecture and yet we can do little else but make conjectures concerning the origin of customs of such remote antiquity  perhaps the yule block will be found at last only the counter part of the

the romans tell us this month took its name from julius caesar an etymon that suited well with the flatteries they heaped on their emperors though they had done nothing but altered the pronunciation of the word iul to make it agree with the name of julius which they pronounced iulus a name which ascanius the son of aeneas had also and which ascended from thence even to the primitive languages of the east  the case had been the same with the month following  if these two months were fixed on to bear the names of their first and second emperors it was principally because their names already resembled those of julius and augustus  they did it also in imitation of the egyptians who had given to these two months the names of their two first kings mesor and thot  as the month of august was the first in the egyptian year the first day of it was called gule which being latinized makes gula our legendaries surprised at seeing this word at the head of the month of august did not overlook

adorning of windows with bay and laurel it is but seldom observed in north but in the southernparts it is very common particularly at our universities where it is customary to adorn not only the common windows of the town and of the colleges but also to bedeck the chapels of the colleges with branches of laurel  the laurel was used among the ancient romans as an emblem of several things and

wrong in christians to make use of these things but only at the same time with the pagans when they observed and solemnized their paganish pastime and worship and of this prohibition they give this reason in the same canon omnis haec observatio paganismi est all this kind of custom does hold of paganism because the outward practice of heathenish rites performed jointly with the pagans themselves could not but imply a consent in paganism  but at present there is no hazard of any such thing it may be an emblem of joy to us without confirming any in the practice of heathenism the time the place

us that the northern goths and swedes have a sport wherein they exercise their youth consisting of a dance with swords in the following manner first with their swords sheathed and erect in their hands they dance in a triple round then with their drawn swords held erect as before afterward extending them from hand to hand they lay hold of each others hilt and point while they are wheeling more moderately round and changing their order throw themselves into the figure of a hexagon which they call a rose  but presently raising and drawing back their swords they undo that figure to form with them a apiece rose that may rebound over the head of each at last they dance rapidly backwards and vehemently rattling the sides of their swords together conclude the sport pipes or songs sometimes both direct the measure which at first is slow but increasing afterward becomes a very quick one toward the conclusion  he calls this a kind of gymnastic rite dr moresin alludes to a dance at this season without swords in these words  sicinnium genus saltationis seu choreae ubi saltitantes cantabant ac papistae facere sunt soliti in scotia ad natalitia domini et alibi adhuc servant p   0  in

adopted this faustinus the bishop inveighs against it with great warmth  they were wont to be covered with skins of cattle and to put on the heads of beasts etc  doctor johnson tells us in his journey to the western islands that a gentleman informed him of an odd game at new years eve in the hall or castle of the lord where at festal seasons there may be supposed a very numerous company one man dresses himself in a cows hide upon which other men beat with sticks he runs with all this noise round the house which all the company quits in a counterfeited fright the door is then shut at new

that allowing for the mutilations of time they are one and the same custom the learned traveller tells us that they who played at this odd game gave no account of the origin of it and that he described it as it might perhaps be used in other places where the reason of it is not yet forgot  i am persuaded that if dr johnson will take the trouble of consulting du canges glossary in verb

nativity appears it is customary among the common people to sing a christmascarol which is a song upon the birth of our savior and generally sung with some such are the new years songs and that whose burden is hagmena the word hagmena is the same as hagiameene or the holy month angli says hospinnian halegmonath quasi sacrum mensem vocant hosp de orig eth p    others from the nativity to the twelvethday the continuance of christmas it comes they say from cantare to sing and rola which is an interjection of joy for in ancient times the burden of the song when men were merry was rola rola  this kind of songs is of an ancient standing they were sung early in the church it self in memory of the nativity as the many hymns for that season manifestly declare tertullian says ut quisque de scripturis sanctis vel de proprio ingenio potest provocatur in medium deo cantare tertul advers gent c    it was customary among the christians at their feasts to bring those who were able to sing into the midst and make them sing a song unto god either out of the holy scripture or of their own composing and invention and as this was done at their feasts so no doubt it was observed at the great feast of the nativity which song no question of it was to them what the christmascarol should be to us in after ages we have it also taken notice of for durand tells us in quibusdam quoque locis  in natali praelati cum suis clericis ludant vel in domibus episcopalibus ita ut etiam descendant  ad cantus durand rat lib   c    s   that on the day of the nativity it was usual for the bishops of some churches to sing among their clergy in the episcopal house which song was undoubted a christmascarol  the reason of this custom seems to be an imitation of the gloria in excelsis or glory be to god on high etc which was sung by the angels as they hovered over the fields of bethlehem in the morning of the nativity for even that song as the learned bishop tailor observes was a christmascarol as soon says he as these blessed choristers had sung their christmas carol and taught the church a hymn to put into her offices for ever in the anniversary of this festivity the angels etc  was this performed with that reverence and decency which are due to a song of this nature in honor of the nativity and glory to our lord it would be very commendable but to sing it as is generally done in the midst of rioting and chambering and wantoness is no honor but disgrace no glory but an affront to that holy season a scandal to religion and a sin against christ  observations on chapter xv the subsequent

which as hospin ibid hospinian tells us was an ancient custom of the heathens and afterward practiced by the christians  and no doubt those christians were highly worthy of censure who imagined as the heathens did that the sending of a present then was any way lucky and an omen of the success of the following year for this was the very thing that made both several holy men and some general councils take notice of and forbid any such custom because the observance of it out of any such design and view was superstitious and sinful we are told in a place of st austin citatur locus ex augustino in

because the day it self was dedicated to idols and because of some profane rites and ceremonies they observed in solemnizing it if then i send a new years gift to my friend it shall be a token of my friendship if to my benefactor a token of my gratitude if to the poor which at this time must never be forgot it shall be to make their hearts sing for joy and give praise and adoration to the giver of all good gifts  another old custom at this time is the wishing of a good newyear either when a new years gift is presented or when friends meet or when a new years song is sung at the door the burden of which is we wish you a happy newyear  this is also a custom among the modern jews who on the first day of the month the month tisri was the seventh month according to the jews sacred computation and therefore it is commanded to be celebrated the first day of the seventh month lev xxiii    but according to their civil computation it was their first month so that feast may be termed

were a wish for a good year and it was customary among the heathens on the calends of january to go about and sing a new years song hospinian therefore tells us that discurrunt namque noctu tam senes

sexes run about here and there and sing a song at the doors of the wealthier people in which they wish them a happy newyear this he speaks indeed of the christians but he calls it an exact copy of the heathens custom  but however i cannot see the harm of retaining this ancient ceremony so it be not used superstitiously nor attended with obscenity and lewdness for then there will be no more in it than an hearty wish for each others welfare and prosperity no more harm than wishing a good day or good night than in bidding one god speed or than in wishing to our friend what abrahams servant did

of clothes between men and women who when dressed in each others habits go from one neighbors house to another and partake of their christmascheer and make merry with them in disguise by dancing and

solemnity besides the sacrifices and other parts of public worship there were several lesser observations worth our notice as first the liberty now allowed to servants to be free and merry with their masters so often alluded to in authors it is probable this was done in memory of the liberty enjoyed in the golden age under saturn before the names of servant and master were known to the world besides this they sent presents to one another among friends no war was to be proclaimed and no offender executed the schools kept a vacation and nothing but mirth and freedom was to be met with in

blow from the church and was taken notice of in the synod can trull    bal     of trullus where it was decreed that the days called the calends should be entirely stripped of their ceremonies and the faithful should no longer observe them that the public dancings of women should cease as being the occasion of much harm and ruin and as being invented and observed in honor of their gods and therefore quite averse to the christian life they therefore decreed that no man should be clothed with a womans garment no woman with a mans  it were to be wished this custom which is still so common

very far who first doubted concerning the lawfulness of this ceremony  if the benevolent can thus hardly be saved how shall the malicious and the envious appear  chap xvii of the twelfth day how observed the wickedness of observing the twelve days after the common way on the epiphany or manifestation of christ to the gentiles commonly called the twelfthday the eastern magi were guided by the star to pay their homage to their savior and because they came that day which is the twelfth after the day of the nativity it is therefore called the twelfthday  the twelfthday it self is one of the greatest of the twelve and of more jovial observation than the others for the visiting of friends and christmasgambols the rites of this day are different in diverse places though the end of them is much the same in all namely to do honor to the memory of the eastern magi whom they suppose to have been kings in in gallia unus ex ministris etc  idem in germania etc hospin in epiphan france one of the courtiers is chosen king whom the king himself and the other nobles attend at an entertainment in germany they observe the same thing on this day in academies and cities where the students and citizens create one of themselves king and provide a magnificent banquet for him and give him the attendance of a king or a stranger guest now this is answerable to that custom of the saturnalia of masters making banquets for their servants and waiting on them and no doubt this custom has in part sprung from that  not many years ago this was a common christmas gambol in both our universities and it is still usual in other places of our land to give the name of king or queen to that person whose extraordinary luck hits upon that part of the divided cake which is honored above the others with a bean in it  but though this be generally the greatest of the twelve yet the others preceding are observed with mirth and jollity generally to excess was this feasting confined within the bounds of decency and moderation and gave more way than it does to the exercises and the religious duties of the season it would have nothing in it immoral or sinful the keeping up of friendship and love and old acquaintance has nothing in it harmful but the misfortune is men upon that bottom act rather like brutes than men and like heathens than christians and the preservation of friendship and love is nothing else but a pretense for drunkenness and rioting and wantonness and such i am afraid has been the observation of the christmas holy days since the holiest times of the christian church and the generality of men have rather looked upon them as a vide bishop blackalls sermon on the lawfulness and the right manner of keeping christmas and other christian festivals time of eating and drinking and playing than of returning praises and thanksgivings to god for the greatest benefit he ever bestowed upon the sons of men  gregory nazianzen in that excellent oration of his upon christmas day says let us not celebrate the feast after an earthly but an heavenly manner let not our doors be crowned let not dancing be encouraged let not the crosspaths be adorned the eyes fed nor the ears delighted etc let us not feast to excess nor be drunk with wine etc from this we may clearly see what has been the custom in these days and in all probability it has been much the same among us from the beginning of christianity however fabulous that story may be taken notice of by origin britan stilling bishop stillingfleet from hector boethius that king arthur kept with his nobles at york a very profane christmas for christmas day is said to be none of the twelve days but one of the twenty for if it was added it would make thirteen days which are the thirteen days here mentioned it is said to be one of the twenty days because as i imagine it was reckoned among those twenty days in which the church forbad fasting for in the laws of canutus it is ordered atque ab ipso natali jesu christi die ad octavam ad epiphania lucem jejunia nemo observato nisi quidam judicio ac voluntate fecerit sua aut id ei fuerit a sacerdote imperatum seld analect lib   p  0  that no man shall fast from christmas day till after the octave of the epiphany except he do it out of choice or it be commanded him of the priest thirteen days together and that such jollity and feasting then had its original from him but however these words if true may be a testimony of the too great antiquity of the abuse of this festival yet they will by no means justify buchannans comment upon them for as the learned bishop goes on buchannan is so well pleased with this notable observation that he sets it down for good history saying upon it that the old saturnalia were renewed only the days increased and saturns name changed to caesars for says he we call the feast julia but why should the name of saturn be changed into caesars was he worshipped for a god among the british christians as saturn was among the old pagans but the name julia imports it by no means for buchannan does not prove that this name was ever used for that festival among the britains and the saxons who brought in both the name and the feast give another vide chap christ candle reason for it  buchannan seems therefore to have a great deal more malice than truth on his side but however such revellings and frolicks and extravagances whether or not derived from the old saturnalia as are customary at this season do come very near to if not exceed its liberties in particular what commoner at this season than for men to rise early in the morning that they may follow strong drink and continue until night till wine inflame them as if christ who came into the world to save us and was manifested to destroy the works of the devil was to be honored with the very works he came to destroy  with some christmas ends with the twelve days but with the generality of the vulgar not till candlemas till then they continue feasting and are ambitious of keeping some of their christmaschear and then are fond of getting quit of it durand tells us hanc quadragessimam cum gaudio celebramus quia christi incarnatio fuit gaudium angelorum and hominum durand lib   c    they celebrated this time with joy because the incarnation of christ was the occasion of joy to angels and men but the lengthening of the time from twelve to forty days seems to have been done out of honor to the virgin marys lyingin under the old law the time of purification was forty days which was to women then what the month is to women now and as during that time the friends and relations of the women pay them visits and do them abundance of honor so this time seems to have been calculated to do honor to the virgins lyingin  there is a canon in the council of trullus can  0 trul bal against those who baked a cake in honor of the virgins lyingin in which it is decreed that no such ceremony should be observed because it was otherwise with her at the birth of our savior than with all other women she suffered no pollution and therefore needed no purification but only in obedience to the law if then the baking of a single cake was faulty how much more so many feasts in her honor  observations on chapter xvii the subsequent extract from colliers ecclesiastical history vol i p     seems to account in a satisfactory manner for the name of twelfth day in the days of king alfred a law was made with relation to holidays by virtue of which the twelve days after the nativity of our savior were made festivals  in the ancient calendar

days  there was a custom similar to this on the festive days of saturn among the romans grecians etc persons of the same rank drew lots for kingdoms and like kings exercised their temporary authority

queen on this day from an ingenious letter preserved in the universal magazine      whence i shall take the liberty to extract a few select passages i went to a friends house in the country to partake of some of those innocent pleasures that constitute a merry christmas i did not return till i had been present at drawing king and queen and eaten a slice of the twelfth cake made by the fair hands of my good friends consort after tea yesterday a noble cake was produced and two bowls containing the fortunate chances for the different sexes our host filled up the tickets the whole company except the king and queen were to be ministers of state maids of honor or ladies of the bedchamber  our kind host and hostess whether by design or accident became king and queen according to twelfth day law each party is to support their character till midnight after supper one called for a kings speech etc the rest is political satire and is foreign to our purpose  i have inserted this with a view of gratifying the curiosity of my northern readers on this head  n b the reader is desired to add the following remarks to the observations on yule all the celtic nations have been accustomed to the worship of the sun either as distinguished from thor or considered as his symbol  it was a custom that every where prevailed in ancient times to celebrate a feast at the winter solstice by which men testified their joy at seeing this great luminary return again to this part of the heavens  this was the greatest solemnity in the year they call it in many places yole or yuul from the word hiaul and houl which even at this day signifies the sun in the languages of bass britagne and cornwall this is giving a celtic derivation of a gothic word two languages extremely different the learned doctor hickes thus derives the term in question iol cimbricum anglo saxonice scriptum geol et dan sax jul o in u facile mutato open intensivi praefixi   et ge faciunt ol commessatio compotatio etc  isl ol cerevisiam denotat et metonymice convivium junii etym v yeol  our ingenious author however is certainly right as to the origin and design of the yule feast the greenlanders at this day keep a sun feast at the winter solstice about dec    to rejoice at the return of the sun and the expected renewal of the hunting season etc which custom they may possibly have learnt of the norvegian colony formerly settled in greenland see crantzs hist of greenland vol i p     ibid in not    vide mallets northern antiquities vol ii p     chap xviii of st pauls day the observation of the weather a custom of the heathens and handed down by the monks the apostle st paul himself is against such observations the opinion of st austin upon them the observation of the weather which is made on this day is altogether ridiculous and superstitious if it happen to be unclouded and without rain it is looked upon as an omen of the following years success if otherwise that the year will be unfortunate thus the old verse clara dies pauli bona tempora denotat anni si fuerint venti denarrant praelia genti si nix aut pluviae pereunt animalia quaeque   the interprepation of which is very well known to be this if st pauls day be fair and clear it does betide a happy year if blustering winds do blow aloft then wars will trouble our realm full often and if it chance to snow or rain then will be dear all sorts of grain   such also is the observation of st swithins day which if rainy is a token that it will rain for forty days successively such is the observation of si sol splendescat maria purificante major erit glacies post festum quam fuit ante  candlemasday such is childermasday such valentinesday and some others  how st pauls day came to have this particular knack of foretelling the good or evil fortune of the following year is no easy matter to find out the monks who were undoubtedly the first who made this wonderful observation have taken care it should be handed down to posterity but why and for what reason this observation was to stand good they have taken care to conceal in church affairs indeed they make free with handing down traditions from generation to generation which being approved by an infallible judgment are to be taken for granted but as far as i hear they never pretended to an infallible spirit in the study of the planets one may therefore without the suspicion of heresy or fear of the inquisition make a little inquiry into this affair and see whether it be true or false whether it is built upon any reason or no reason whether still to be observed or only laughed at as a monkish dream  now as it is the day of that saint the great apostle st paul i cannot see there is any thing to be built upon he did indeed labor more abundantly than all the apostles but never that i heard in the science of astrology and why his day should therefore be a standing almanac to the world rather than the day of any other saint will be pretty hard to find out i am sure there is a good number of them have as much right to rain or fair weather as st paul and if st andrew st thomas etc have not as much right to wind or snow let the reader judge  as it is the twenty fifth day of january one would think that could be no reason for what is that day more than another indeed they do give some show of reason why rain should happen about the time of st swithin which is this about the time of his feast which is on the fourteenth of july there are two rainy constellations which are called praecepe and asellus which arise cosmically and generally produce rain and to be sure in the course of the sign aquarius there may be both rain and wind and fair weather but how these can foretell the destiny of the year is the question  as then there is nothing in the saint or his day to prognosticate any such thing i mean as it is the day of st paul or the twenty fifth of january so i must confess i cannot find out what may be the ground of this particular observation but however thus much is very obvious that this observation is an exact copy of that superstitious custom among the heathens of observing one day as good and another as bad for among them were lucky and unlucky days some were dies atri and some dies albi the atri were pointed out in their calendar with a black character the albi with a white the former to denote it a day of bad success the latter a day of good thus have the monks in the dark and unlearned ages of popery copied after the heathens and dreamed themselves into the like superstitions esteeming one day more successful than another and so according to them it is very unlucky to begin any work upon childermassday and what day soever that falls on whether on a monday tuesday or any other nothing must be begun on that day through the year st pauls day is the years fortune tellers st marks day is the prognosticator of your life and death etc and so instead of persuading the people to lay aside the whims and fancies of the heathen world they brought them so effectually in that they are still reigning in many places to this day  but of all the days of the year they could not have chosen one so little to the purpose for the very saint whose day is so observed has himself cautioned them against any such observation for in the fourth chapter of his epistle to the galations he tells them how dangerous it was to observe days and months and times and years which is not as some would persuade us to caution us against the observation of any day but the lords day but only that we should not observe the abolished feasts of the jews nor the abominable feasts of the gentiles nor their superstitious observation of fortunate and unfortunate days st austin upon this place has these words non itaque dies observemus and annos and menses and tempora ne audiamus ab apostolo timeo vos ne forte sine causa laboraverim in vobis eos enim culpat qui dicunt non profisiscar quia posterus est aut quia luna sic fertur vel profisiscar ut prospera cedant quia ita se habet positio siderum etc beda ex augustine in loc let us not observe years and months and times least we hear the apostle telling us i am afraid of you least i have shown on you labor in vain for the persons he blames are those who say i will not set forward on my journey because it is the next day after such a time or because the moon is so or i will set forward that i may have luck because such is just now the position of the stars i will not traffic this month because such a star presides or i will because it does i shall plant no vines this year because it is leapyear etc  the learned mr bingham has among several others a quotation bingham    l c   antiq eccl p  00 aust de doct christ l   c  0 from the same st austin on these superstitious observations with which i shall conclude this chapter to this kind says he belong all ligatures and remedies which the schools of physicians reject and condemn whether in enchantments or in certain marks which they call characters or in some other things which are to be hanged and bound about the body and kept in a dancing posture not for any temperament of the body but for certain significations either ocult or manifest which by a gentler name they call physical that they may not seem to affright men with the appearance of superstition but do good in a natural way such are earrings hanged upon the tip of each ear and rings made of an ostriches bones for the finger or when you are told in a fit of convulsions or shortness of breath to hold your left thumb with your right hand to which may be added a thousand vain observations as if any of our members beat if when two friends are talking together a stone or a dog or a child happens to come between them they tread the stone to pieces as the divider of their friendship and this is tolerable in comparison of beating an innocent child that comes between them but it is more pleasant that sometimes the childrens quarrel is revenged by the dogs for many times they are so superstitious as to dare to beat the dog that comes between them who turning again upon him that smites him sends him from seeking a vain remedy to seek a real physician indeed hence proceed likewise these other superstitions for a man to tread upon his threshold when he passes by his own house to return back to bed again if he chance to sneeze as he is putting on his shoes to return into his house if he stumble at his going out if the rats know his cloths to be more terrified with the suspicion of some future evil then concerned for the present loss he says cato gave a wise and smart answer to such an one who came in some consternation to consult him about the rats having knawed his stockings that said he is no great wonder but it would have been a wonder indeed if the stockings had knawed the rats st austin mentions this witty answer of a wise heathen to convince christians the better of the unreasonableness and vanity of all such superstitious observations and he concludes that all such arts whether of triffling or more noxious superstition are to be rejected and avoided by christians as proceeding originally from some pernicious society between men and devils and being the compacts and agreements of such treacherous and deceitful friendship the apostle forbids us to have fellowship with devils and that he says respects not only idols and things offered to idols but all imaginary signs pertaining to the worship of idols and also all remedies and other observations which are not appointed publicly by god to promote the love of god and our neighbor but proceed from the private fancies of men and tend to delude the hearts of poor deluded mortals for these things have no natural virtue in them but owe all their efficacy to a presumptuous confederacy with devils and they are full of pestiferous curiosity tormenting anxiety and deadly slavery they were first taken up not for any real power to be discerned in them but gained their power by mens observing them and therefore by the devils art they happen differently to different men according to their own apprehensions and presumptions for the great deceiver knows how to procure things agreeable to every mans temper and ensnare him by his own suspicions and consent  observations on chapter xviii a great deal upon this subject may be found in plinys natural history tending to confirm what mr bourne has told us that it was a custom of gentilism adopted under the papal superstition and so transmitted to our times the subsequent poetical

consequence on the day of the week on which the third of may falls which he calls the dismal day  chap xix of candlemassday why so called the blasphemy of the church of rome in consecrating wax candles this day goes under several denominations it is called the day of christs presentation because on it christ was presented in the temple it is called the holy day of st simeon because it was on it that he took our savior up in his arms and it is called the purification because then the holy virgin was purified it is generally a day of festivity and more than ordinary observation among women and is therefore called the wives feast day the feasting seems to be observed in honor of the virgin mary for as on the day of a womans being churchd there is no common entertainment so it seems that this feasting was begun in the times of popery by way of compliment to the churchingday of the virgin mary  it has the name of nos anglica the purification of our lady vel communi sermon potius

was observed all winter at vespers and litanies were then wont to cease till the next allhallowmass  these lights so carried about were blessed of the priests as hospinian tells us who made use of the following prayers at their consecration rogamus te per invocationem sancti tui nominis and per intercessionem mariae beatae virginis matris filii tui etc ut consecrare velis has candelas ad utilitatem and commodum hominis etc and mox domine jesu benedicas obsecro hanc creaturam ceream and concede illi caelestem  malignus spiritus contremescat and ita territus aufugiat etc hospin de fest purific p    we implore thee by the invocation of thy holy name and by the intercession of the blessed virgin mary the mother of thy son whose feast we this day celebrate with the highest devotion and by the intercession of all thy saints that thou would sanctify these candles to the good and profit of men and the health of his soul and body whether in earth or sea and again o lord jesu i beseech thee that thou would bless this thy creature of wax and grant it thy heavenly benediction by the power of thy holy cross that as it was a gift to man by which the darkness might be driven away so now it may be endowed with such virtue by the sign of the holy cross that wheresoever it is lighted and placed the evil spirit may tremble and with his servants be in such terror and confusion as to fly away from that habitation and no more vex and disturb thy servants  after this he adjures the wax candles in words like these adjuro te creaturam ceream in nomine domini nostri and sanctae trinitatis ut sis extirpatio and depulsio diaboli and spectrorum ejus etc hospin ibid i adjure thee o thou waxen creature in the name of our lord and the holy trinity that thou repel and extirpate the devil and his sprights etc and therefore all christians says eccius tom   hom de purificat ought to use these lights with an holy love having a sincere dependence that thus they shall be freed by the power of the word and this prayer from all the snares and frauds of the devil  our author upon this says that this is manifest blasphemy and idolatry for as on the one hand they take the name of god and the holy trinity in vain so on the other they attribute to a wax candle what should be ascribed to christ alone and the quickening power of the holy ghost  observations on chapter xix in the forenamed ancient calendar of the romish church i find the subsequent observations on the  d of february usually called candlemas day  torches are consecrated  torches are given away for many days feb   purificatio virginis faces consecrantur faces dantur multis diebus    pope sergius in a convocation in the reign of henry  th  in the passage that relates to rites and ceremonies  among those that were not to be contemned or cast away was bearing of candles on candlemass day in memory of christ the spiritual light of whom simeon did prophecy as is read in the church that day fullers church history p        says becon in his relics of rome fol     commanded that all the people should go on procession upon candlemasse day and carry candels about with them brenning in their hands in the year of our lord     durand etc  how this candlebearing on candlemass day came first up the author of our english festival declares on this manner sometime says he when the romans by great might and royal power conquered all the world they were so proud that they forgot god and made them diverse gods after their own lust and so among all they had a god that they called mars that had been tofore a notable knight in battle and so they prayed to him for help and for that they would speed the better of this knight the people prayed and did great worship to his mother that was called februa after which woman much people have opinion that the month february is called wherefore the  d day of this month is candlemass day  the romans this night went about the city of rome with torches and candles brenning in worship of this woman februa for hope to have the more help and succoure of her son mars  then was there a pope that was called sergius and when he saw christian people draw to this false maumetry and untrue belief he thought to undo this foul use and custom and turn it into gods worship and our ladys and gave commandment that all christian people should come to church and offer up a candle brennyng in the worship that they did to this woman februa and do worship to our lady and to her son our lord jesus christ so that now this feast is solemnly hallowed through all christendom and every christan man and woman of covenable age is bound to come to church and offer up their candles as though they were bodily with our lady hopyng for this reverence and worship that they do to our lady to have a great reward in heaven etc  ray in his collection of proverbs preserves one that relates to this day on candlemasday throw candle and candlestick away somerset  chap xx of valentineday its ceremonies what the council of trullus thought of such customs that they had better be omitted it is a ceremony never omitted among the vulgar to draw lots which they term valentines on the eve before

these words can    in syn trul in bals p   0 the custom of drawing lots was after this manner on the   d day of june which is the eve of st john baptist men and women were accustomed to gather together in the evening by the seaside or in some certain houses and there adorn a girl who was her parents firstbegotten child after the manner of a bride then they feasted and leaped after the manner of bacchanals and danced and shouted as they were wont to do on their holy days after this they poured into a narrow neckd vessel some of the seawater and put also into it certain things belonging to each of them then as if the devil gifted the girl with the faculty of telling future things they would enquire with a loud voice about the good or evil fortune that should attend them upon this the girl would take out of the vessel the first thing that came to hand and show it and give it to the owner who upon receiving it was so foolish as to imagine himself wiser as to the good or evil fortune that should attend him  this custom as he tells us a little after is altogether diabolical and surely it was so being used as a presage of what was future was the custom of the lots now mentioned used as among the heathens they would no doubt be as worthy of condemnation but as far as i know there is but little credit given to them though that little is too much and ought to be laid aside but if the custom was used without any mixture or allay of superstition as i believe it is in some places yet it is often attended with great inconveniences and misfortunes with

choose their mates about this time of the year and probably from thence came the custom of young persons choosing valentines or special loving friends on that day this is the commonly received opinion  i rather incline to controvert this supposing it to be the remains of an ancient superstition in the church of rome on this day of choosing patrons for the year ensuing and that because ghosts were

for his love and charity that the custom of choosing valentines upon his festival which is still practiced took its rise from thence i know not how my reader will be satisfied with this learned writers explication  he has given us no premises in my opinion from whence we can draw any such conclusion  were not all the saints supposed to be famous for their love and charity surely he does not mean that we should understand the word love here as implying gallantry   the learned moresin tells et vere ad valentini festum a viris habent foeminae munera et alio temporis viris dantur in scotia

at this season that our present customs are very unbecoming shrovetide signifies the time of confessing sins as the word tide which signifies time and the saxon word shrive or shrift which signifies confession plainly show the reason why this time is so denominated is because it was set apart by the church of rome for a time of shriving or confessing sins for then people were wont to confess their sins and receive the sacrament that they might be better prepared for the religious observation of the following season of lent thus in the constitutions of simon of sudbury archbishop of canterbury was made at lambeth a d      in the second year of richard the second in the first year of urban the fifth pope and clement the seventh antipope this most eloquent man who was wise

sudbury in suffolk a skull which is shown to strangers for the skull of this bishop and probably it is the true one simon sudbury it is ordered that laymen should be admonished to confess in the very beginning of lent and in theodolphuss capitula it is ordered that on the week next before lent every man should go to his shrift and his shrift should shrive him in such a manner as his deeds which he had done required and that he should charge all that belong to his district that if any of them have discord with any he make peace with him if any one will not be brought to this then he shall not shrive him but then he shall inform the bishop that he may convert him to what is right if he be willing to belong to god then all contentions and disputes shall cease and if there be any one of them that has taken offense at another then shall they be reconciled that they may more freely say in the lords prayer lord forgive us our trespasses etc and having thus purified their minds let them enter upon the holy fast tide and cleanse themselves by satisfaction against holy easter etc johnson        constitut  this custom of confessing to the priest at this time was laid aside by our church at the reformation for sins are to be confessed to god alone and not to the priest except when the conscience cannot otherwise be quieted then indeed the grief is to be opened to the spiritual guide in private exhort to the com that by the ministry of gods word he may give the benefit of absolution together with ghostly council and advice to the quieting of the conscience and the avoiding of all scruple and doubtfulness but how this other worse custom came to be retained of indulging all manner of luxury and intemperance i know nothing but that the flesh was too powerful for the spirit the duties of religion how justly soever enjoined us are tamely dispensed with but what will not we rather do than give up the pleasures of life surely the church never designed when she so justly took away the public confessions of this season that rioting and gaming and drunkenness should continue amongst us are these a fit preparation for so solemn a season will they qualify us for the hearing of the history of our lords passion will they prepare us for the reception of his body and blood and fit us to meet him in the morning of the resurrection will they not rather speak us heathens than christians and lead us to hell than on the way to heaven such customs as these may in some measure be excusable among them whose vid seldon table talk c of christmas church has too much led them into those things but it is scandalous and sinful and abominable in those who pretend to be the enemies of error and superstition to continue the observation of such sinful customs  observations on chapter xxi mr bourne seems to wonder at the luxury and intemperance that usually prevailed at this season was he ignorant that this was no more than a vestige of the romish carnival see pancaketuesday in the appendix  the learned moresin comedit enim et bibit seque loco jocoque omnimodo adeo dedit quasi usui nunquam veniant quasi cras moritura hodie prius omnium rerum capere velit satietatem etc deprav

first we fast and then we feast first there is a carnival and then a lent  fitzstephen informs us that anciently on shrovetuesday the schoolboys used to bring cocks of the game the learned moresin informs us that the papists derived this custom of exhibiting cockfights on one day every year from the athenians and from an institution of themistocles  galli gallinacei says he producuntur per diem

their perquisites these were called fugees corrupt i suppose of refugees  i forbear to describe the mode of throwing at cocks for as boerhaave observes on another occasion to teach the arts of cruelty

christian church of penitents expressing their humiliation at this time by appearing in sackcloth and ashes cinere quia se conspergunt in poenitentia judaei gregor mag statuit ut in quadragessima ante

triumphs of rome p      the want of this discipline is at present supplied by reading publicly on this day the curses denounced against impenitent sinners when the people repeat an amen after each

palm sunday why so called how observed in the popish times what it is truly to carry palms in our hands on this day the sunday before easter which is denominated palm sunday is so called dicitur enim dominica in ramis palmarum quod illo die rami palmarum in processionibus deportentur in significationem illorum quos filii israel statuerunt in via christo jam veniente belith     p    cap durand lib   p     in ram because as the ritualists say on that day the boughs of palm trees were wont to be carried in procession in imitation of those which the children of israel strawed in the way of christ for they cut down branches from the trees and strawed them in the way which according to the consent of antiquity were the branches of the palm tree it being very common in that country and used as an emblem of victory and a doctor of our own church in his discourse upon this festival says dr sparks feasts and fasts from the story as described by st luke and st matthew some of the ancient church took occasion as on this day to go in procession with palms in their hands and to denominate it palm sunday  but however harmless this custom might have been in the times of its first institution it is certain that in after ages it sunk into superstition and gross idolatry thus the rhemists in their translation of the new testament describe the ceremony themselves these offices of honor done to our savior extraordinarily were very acceptable and for a memory hereof the holy church makes a solemn procession every year upon this day specially in our country when it was catholic with the blessed sacrament reverently carried as it were christ upon the ass and strawing of bushes and flowers bearing of palms setting up boughs spreading and hanging up the richest clothes the quire and quiresters singing as here the children and the people all done in a very godly ceremony to the honor of christ and the memory of his triumph upon this day the like service and the like duties done to him in all other solemn processions of the blessed sacrament and otherwise be undoubtedly no less grateful dr fulk in loc mat fulke upon this gives this answer your palm sunday procession was horrible idolatry and abusing of the lords institution who ordained his supper to be eaten and drunken not to be carried about in procession like a heathenish idol but it is pretty sport that you make the priests that carries this idol to supply the room of the ass on which christ did ride thus you turn the holy mystery of christs riding to jerusalem to a may game and pagent play and yet you say such service done to christ is undoubtedly exceeding grateful yea no less grateful than that was done by his disciples at the time mentioned in the text your argument and proof is none but your bare asseverations that which the disciples did had the warrant of the holy scripture but who has regarded these theatrical pomps at their hands or what word of god have you to assure you that he accepts such will worship who detesteth all worship which is according to the doctrines and traditions of men and not after his own commandment  from this superstitious and idolatrous custom without all doubt it comes to pass that we now and then on a palm sunday see the young people carrying branches of palms in their hands which they seem fond of having that day and which they as little regard at other times it is true indeed it is a relick of the ancient superstition of the papists but as it is now entirely stripped of any superstition and is an emblem of the season and the transactions of that day so i see no harm in so innocent an observation  but how much better would it be to carry in our hands this day ramos debent fideles portare id est bona opera  opera miserecordiae sunt vestire nudos colligere hospites errantes revocare visitare infirmos etc bed tom   p     the palm of good works the graces of humility and kindness and charity to feed the hungry to give drink to the thirsty to clothe the naked to entertain the strangers to visit the sick and in prison etc by such actions as these should we truly carry palms in our hands by these we should truly straw the way for our lord and so follow his steps to the heavenly jerusalem  observations on chapter xxii there can be no doubt but that palm sunday the dominica in ramis palmarum was so called from the palm branches and green boughs formerly distributed on that day in commemoration of our lords riding to jerusalem in fullers church history p     we read bearing of palms on palm sunday is in memory of the receiving of christ into jerusalem a little before his death and that we may have the same desire to receive him into our hearts provision is made for retaining the rites used on palm sunday and we have also the reasons told us why they should be retained in the convocation in the time of henry  th referred to in the observations on the preceding chapter  sprigs of box wood are still used as a substitute for palms in roman catholic countries  stow in his survey of london tells us that in the week before easter had ye great shows made for the fetching in of a twisted tree or with as they termed it out of the woods into the kings house and the like into every mans house of honor or worship this must also have been a substitute for the palm thus it is still customary with our boys to go out and gather the willow flowers or buds at this time  these seem to have been selected because in the north they are generally the only things at this season in which the power of vegetation can be discovered  the russians of the greek church have a very solemn procession on palm sunday  chap xxiii of rising early on easter day what is meant by the sun dancing that morn the antiquity of rising early on this day the end and design of it the great advantage of it it is a common custom among the vulgar and uneducated part of the world to rise before the sun on easter day and walk into the fields the reason of which is to see the sun dance which they have been told from an old tradition always dances as upon that day we read indeed that the sun once josh x stood still but whether the sun danced upon the very day our savior rose on we cannot tell it is very probable it did not because the scriptures are silent and that it never did so since i think we may be well assured forasmuch as never any that we have heard of have seen any such thing since that time if therefore this tradition has any meaning it must be a metaphorical one that when the morning proves clear there is a seeming smile over the face of nature and earth and heaven show tokens of joy for as the earth and her valleys by standing thick with corn are said to laugh and sing so on account of the resurrection the heavens and the sun may be said to dance for joy or as the psalmist words it psalm xcvi    caeliquidem digni laetentur terra autem exultet damasc in dominicam pascha p     the heavens may rejoice and the earth may be glad  there is then really speaking nothing in the dancing of the sun upon easter day but yet it is a very ancient and commendable custom to be up early at this holy time and therefore damascen in his paschal hymn sings vigilemus mane profundo and pro unguenti hymnum afferamus domino and christum videamus justitiae solemn omnibus vitam exorientem ibid let us watch very early in the morning and instead of ointment let us bring an hymn to our lord and let us see our christ the sun of righteousness who is the life that rises to all men and indeed it is the most seasonable time for meditating on our lords resurrection and it is pleasing circumstances for as the place where any notable thing has been transacted seldom or never fails to raise the idea of the transaction so the particular time when it was done does generally produce the same effect and as the truth of the former was the occasion of many holy and religious men going fulk test cont rhem matthew cap    in annot to visit the place of the sepulcher and hear it as it were say what the angel did to the women come see the place where the lord lay so the truth of the latter was the reason why devout and holy men did in the best ages of the church rise early in the morning of the resurrection the primitive christians spent the night preceding it in prayers and praises till the time of cockcrow the supposed hour of our saviors rising for as latinorum concors est sententia christum non media nocte verum mane in aurora canentibus vice gallorum angelis devicta morte and confractis portis inferi surrexisse durant de rit lib   cap   durant tells us it is universally assented to by the latin church that after our savior had conquered death and broken the gates of hell he arose from the dead not at midnight but in the morning at the time of cockcrow which not the cocks but the angels themselves proclaimed and when these pernoctations were laid aside it was the custom to rise early and spend the morning in such a manner as was suitable to the nature of the time the salutation of the eastern church anestese or the lord is risen and the usual answer the lord is risen indeed were no doubt the common salutation of that morning and if this present custom of the vulgar has had at any time any laudable custom for its original it was no doubt this of rising early to contemplate the more seasonably on the resurrection of christ  and now was this the end of rising early at that holy time it would be very advantageous but to rise with the view of the vulgar is foolish and ridiculous would we rise before the sun and prevent the dawn of day our meditations would be strong and vigorous and almost persuade us that the real actions of that morn were presented to our view for when at that time all things are hushed in silence and wrapped in darkness or but illuminated with the friendly moon the devotae christi foeminae quae illum and vivum dilexerant and mortuum desiderabant per noctem ambulantes juvante luna venerunt ad monumentum rupert de divin officiis lib   cap    guide of mary magdalene and the other women to the sepulcher it is easy and natural to meditate on these things to see our saviors tomb to see the angels sit as guardians on it and the trembling watch fled into the city and now the lord is risen indeed and they that seek him early shall find him maria magdalena cujus domus erat bethaniae  prima ante alias una sabbati juxta joannem valde diluculo venisset dum adhuc tenebrae essent ad monumentum rupert ibid behold then mary magdalene on the first day of the week coming from her own house at bethany before the other women very early in the morning when it was as yet dark abit a loco volens consolationem quandam invenire theophlact in loc to find ease and consolation at the sepulcher behold she and the other women bringing the prepared spices to embalm their lord behold peter and john running to the sepulcher and returning whilst mary continues in sorrow and tears and as she weeps ye may see her look into the sepulcher but he is not there he is risen behold then the guardians of the tomb saying john xx    etc woman why weepest thou nay behold the lamb of god himself with the very same words wiping away the tears from her eyes and jesus said unto her woman why weepest thou whom seek thou she supposing him to be the gardener says unto him sir if thou have born him hence tell me where thou have laid him and i will take him away jesus said unto her mary with what joy now does she run to his feet willing and desirous and eager to embrace them but he bids her not to touch him but go to his brethren and say unto them i ascend unto my father and your father to my god and your god behold a little after this his apparition to her and the other women and how he suffers them to kiss his feet taylors antiq christ de resurrect he appeared also about the same time to peter  these and the other accidents at our lords resurrection would afford us a satisfactory and comfortable meditation would inflame our hearts with a burning love and melt us into tears of joy in our eager wishes and warm desires we should with the holy women kiss the feet of our savior and be almost partakers of equal happiness with them or sure we are that we should have our savior in our hearts and not fail of seeing him in his kingdom he whom we have so carefully sought for will vouchsafe to be found of us in his grace at the sepulcher and in his glory in heaven happy they who so early seek their savior who long after him as the heart does after the waterbrooks who seek him among the sol song ii    lilies until the day break and the shadows flee away happy they their conversation is now in heaven and their happiness hereafter will be the joys of eternity where they shall no more be absent but ever present with the lord  observations on chapter xxiii mr bourne has exhausted the subject of this chapter the learned author of the vulgar errors has left us his thoughts concerning it in the subsequent quotation in which if the matter be not found curious the manner perhaps will be considered as highly so we shall not i hope says he disparage the resurrection of our redeemer if we say the sun does not dance on easter day i have heard of when a boy and cannot positively say whether i have not seen tried an ingenious method of making an artificial sun dance on easter sunday  a vessel full of water was set out in the open air in which the reflected sun seemed to dance from the tremulous motion of the water this looks not unlike a relic of popish legerdemain it reminds me of a beautiful simile in the loves of medea and jason in the argonautics of apollonius rhodius it is there applied to the wavering resolves of a lovesick maiden       etc reflected from the suns far cooler ray as quivering beams from tossing water play poured by some maid into her beachen bowl and ceaseless vibrate as the swellings roll so heaved the passions etc   and though we would willingly assent unto any sympathetical exultation yet cannot conceive therein any more than a tropical expression whether any such motion there were in that day wherein christ arised scripture has not revealed which has been punctual in other records concerning solary miracles and the areopagite that was amazed at the eclipse took no notice of this and if metaphorical expressions go so far we may be bold to affirm not only that one sun danced but two arose that day that light appeared at his nativity and darkness at his death and yet a light at both for even that darkness was a light unto the gentiles illuminated by that obscurity that twas the first time the sun set above the horizon that although there were darkness above the earth there was light beneath it nor dare we say that hell was dark if he were in it  this is a fine aenigmatical way of reasoning and from the turn of his discourse one might have asked with the butlers compliment to vellum in the haunted house if it were not to be too ludicrous upon a solemn subject i fancy master doctor you could make a riddle  for the pasche vulgo paste or easter eggs with which children entertain themselves here in the north at this season and of which mr bourne has taken no notice see the appendix in verbo pasche or paste eggs  chap xxiv of easter holy days a time of relaxation from labor how observed in the dark ages of popery that our customs at this time are sprung from theirs on the holy days of easter it is customary for work to cease and servants to be at liberty which is a resemblance of the practice of the primitive church which set apart the whole week after easter for to praise and glorify god for our saviors resurrection in which servos autem and ancillas ac omnes qui nostro servitio sunt addicti profecto ab omni servitutis severitate eos hoc tempore laxare debemus  ut libere and secure omnes possint ad audiendum divinum officium convenire and communicare belith cap     time all servile labor ceased that servants as well as others might be present at the devotions of the season but other customs so frequently observed at this time such as public shows gamings horseraces etc were forbidden as being foreign to the holiness of this season  in after ages when the church fell into corruption and the substance of religion decayed into the shadow of ceremonies the usual prayers and praises of the season were either much neglected or but superficially observed for belithus a ritualist of those times tells us sunt enim nonnullae ecclesiae in quibus usitatum est ut vel etiam episcopi and archiepiscopi in caenobiis cum suis ludant subditis ita ut etiam ad lusum pilae demittant etc belith c   0 that it was customary in some churches for the bishops and archbishops themselves to play with the inferior clergy even at handball and this also as durandus witnesses in quibusdam locis hac die vid pasch etc durand lib   cap    even on easter day it self this was called atque haec quidem libertas ideo dicta est decembrica etc belith ibid the liberty of december because that formerly it was customary among the heathens in that month to indulge their servants with a certain time of liberty when they were on the level with their masters and feasted and banqueted with them  why they should play at handball at this time rather than any other game i have not been able to find out but i suppose it will be readily granted that this custom of so playing was the original of our present recreations and diversions on easter holy days and in particular of playing at handball for a vid seld table talk of christmas tanzycake which at this season is generally practiced and i would hope practiced with harmlessness and innocence for when the common devotions of the day are over there is is nothing sinful in lawful recreation but for the governors of churches to descend to such childish exercises and that even on the great sunday of the year was not only unbecoming their gravity and reservedness but was also a downright breach of the fourth commandment but these were ages of ignorance and darkness when the world was taught for the doctrines of god the commandments of men  observations on chapter xxiv festa dies quoties rediit concessaque rite otia purpureoque rubentes lumine soles invitant mons catherinae p   by the law concerning

against the shield and do not fall he is thought to have performed a worthy deed  if so be without breaking his lance he runs strongly again the shield down he falls into the water for the boat is

that is i have got the ball tells us that it signifies i have obtained the victory i am master of my wishes  the romanists certainly erected a standard on easter day in token of our lords victory but it would perhaps be indulging fancy too far to suppose that the bishops and governors of churches who used to condescend to play at handball at this time did it in a mystical way and with reference to the triumphal joy of the season  certain it is however that many of their customs and superstitions are founded on still more trivial circumstances than even this imaginary analogy  it was an ancient custom for the mayor aldermen and sheriff of newcastle accompanied with great numbers of the burgesses to go every year at the feasts of easter and whitsuntide to the forth the little mall of our town with the maces sword and cap of maintenance carried before them the young people of the town still assemble there at this season particularly play at handball dance etc but are no longer countenanced in their innocent festivity by the presence of their governors who no doubt in ancient times used to unbend the brow of authority and partake with their happy and contented people the puerile pleasures of the festal season   at this time rather than any other game  i find in j boemus aubanus in paschate vulgo placentae pinsuntur quarum una interdum duae adolescentibus una puellis altera a

they cut a square trench in the ground leaving the turf in the middle on that they make a fire of wood on which they dress a large candle of eggs butter oatmeal and milk and bring besides the ingredients of the caudle plenty of beer and whiskey for each of the company must contribute something the rites begin with spilling some of the caudle on the ground by way of libation on that every one takes a cake of oatmeal upon which are raised nine square knobs each dedicated to some particular being the supposed preserver of their flocks and herds or to some particular animal the real destroyer of them each person then turns his face to the fire breaks off a knob and flinging it over his shoulders says this i give to thee preserve thou my horses this to thee preserve thou my sheep

first of may with green sycamore and hawthorn boughs and of planting trees or rather stumps of trees before their houses and on may eve they from towns make excursions into the country and having cut down a tall elm brought it into town fitted a straight and taper pole to the end of it and painted the same erect it in the most public places and on holidays and festivals adorn it with flower garlands or insigns and streamers he adds this usage is nothing more than a gratulation of the spring season and every house exhibited a proper signal of its approach to testify their universal joy at the revival of vegetation  the author of the pamphlet entitled the way to things by words and to words by things in his specimen of an etimological vocabulary considers the may pole dr moresin gives

some country parishes to go round the bounds and limits of the parish on one of the three days before holy thursday or the feast of our lords ascension when the minister accompanied with his churchwardens and parishioners were wont to deprecate the vengeance of god beg a blessing on the fruits of the earth and preserve the rights and properties of their parish  the original of this custom is dated from the times of the heathens for refert plutarchus in problem    numam popilium cum finitimis agri terminis constituisse and in ipsis finibus terminum deum quasi finium praesidem amicitioeque ac pacis custodem posuisse festa ei dicata quae terminalia nuncupanturquorum vice nos quotannis ex vetustissima consuetudine parochiarum terminos lustramus spelm gloss in verbo perambulat from the days of numa popilius they worshipped the god terminus whom they looked upon to be the guardian of fields and landmarks and the keeper up of friendship and peace among men upon this account the feast called terminalia was dedicated to him instead of which it is a very ancient custom to surround the bounds of parishes every year and instead of heathenish rites and sacrifices to an imaginary god to offer praises and prayers to the true god the god of the whole earth the custom was the people accompanied the bishop or some of the clergy into the fields where litanies were made and the mercy of god implored that he would avert the evils of plague and pestilence that he would send them good and seasonable weather and give them the fruits of the earth in due season  the litanies or rogations which were it is called rogationweek because of that prayer and fasting that was then used for to supplicate god for his blessing on the fruits of the earth it is also in some places called crossweek because in ancient times when the priest went into the fields the cross was carried before them in the northern parts it is called gangweek from to gang which in the north signifies to go then made use of and gave name to the time of rogationweek were first observed by mamertus bishop of vienna in the year   0 dum civitas viennensium crebro terrae motu subrueretur and

that happened and the incursions of wild beasts which laid in ruins and depopulated the city not that litanies and rogations were not used before but that before this time they were not affixed to these days and since that they have been observed of the whole church at this season except the church of hispani autem propter hoc quod scriptum est non possunt filii sponsi lugere quamdiu cum illis

easter day to the feast of pentecost it was the custom of the church not to fast for as they themselves reasoned the children of the bridechamber cannot fast so long as the bridegroom is with them and therefore they held their rogations after pentecost  what now remains among us is the relick of this ancient and laudable custom which was always observed in the old church of england and has been also in some measure since the reformation too  in council cloveshoviae sub cuthbert arch cant an     cap    ut litaniae i e rogationes a clero omnique populo his diebus cum magna reverentia agantur

caelos cum jejunio etc spelman gloss     the canons of cuthbert archbishop of canterbury which were made at cloveshoo in the year     it was ordered that litanies that is rogations should be observed of the clergy and all the people with great reverence on these days viz the seventh of the kalends of may according to the rites of the church of rome who terms this the greater litany and also according to the custom of our forefathers on the three days before the ascension of our lord into the heavens with fasting etc and in the injunctions made in the reign of queen elizabeth it is ordered injunct    eliz that the curate at certain and convenient places shall admonish the people to give thanks to god in the beholding of gods benefits for the increase and abundance of his fruits upon the face of the earth with the saying of the  0  psalm etc at which time the minister shall inculcate these or such sentences cursed be he which translateth the bounds and doles of his neighbors or such orders of prayers as shall be hereafter  agreeable to this we read in the life of the pious hooker walt in vit hookeri that he would by no means omit the customary time of procession persuading all both rich and poor if they desired the preservation of love and their parish rites and liberties to accompany him in his perambulation and most did so in which perambulation he would usually express more pleasant discourse than at other times and would then always drop some loving and facetious observations to be remembered against the next year especially by the boys and young people still inclining them and all his present parishioners to meekness and mutual kindnesses and love because love thinks not evil but covers a multitude of infirmities  we may also observe that the particular office ordered by our church for rogationsunday is exactly suited to the nature of the season that the three days following are appointed fasts by our church and that one of our church homilies is composed particularly for the parochial perambulation all which shows the custom and intention of the church and that the practicing of it would be serviceable to the sons of men would save their lives from destruction and crown them with mercy and loving kindness would send them springs into their rivers and make them run among the hills would bring forth grass for the cattle and green herb for the service of men  observations on chapter xxvi the word parochia or parish anciently signified what we now call the diocese of a bishop  in the early ages of the christian church as kings founded cathedrals so great men founded parochial churches for the conversion of themselves and their dependents the bounds of the parochial division being commonly the same with those of the founders jurisdiction some foundations of this kind were as early as justinian the emperor bid mentions them about  00  before the reign of edward the confessor the parochial divisions in this kingdom were so far advanced that every person might be traced to the parish to which he belonged  this appears by the canons published in the time of edgar and canute the distinction of parishes as they now stand appears to have been settled before the norman conquest in doomsday book the parishes agree very near to the modern division see colliers eccl hist vol i p      camden tells us that this kingdom was first divided into parishes by honorius archbishop of canterbury a d     and counts      parishes  the lateran council made some such division as this it compelled every man to pay tithes to his parish priest men before that time paid them to whom they pleased since then it has happend that few if they could be excused from doing it would care to pay them at all  blount tells us that rogation

used and fasting or at least abstinence then enjoined by the church to all persons not only for a devout preparative to the feasts of christs glorious ascension and the descent of the holy ghost shortly after but also to request and supplicate the blessing of god upon the fruits of the earth  and in this respect the solemnization of matrimony is forbidden from the first day of the said week till trinity sunday  the dutch call it cruys week i e cross week and so it is called in some parts of england because of old as still among roman catholics when the priests went on procession this week the cross was carried before them at oxford at this time the little crosses cut in the stones of buildings to denote the division of the parishes are whited with chalk great numbers of boys with pilled willow rods in their hands accompany the minister etc in the procession  on ascensionday the magistrates river jury etc of the corporation of newcastle upon tyne according to an ancient custom make their annual procession by water in their barges visiting the bounds of their jurisdiction on the river to prevent encroachments etc  cheerful libations are offered on the occasion to the genius

of the tyne is represented pouring forth his coal in great abundance  there is the severn with her lampreys and the humber with his pigs of lead which with thames and the tyne compose the four great

of kindling fires their original that this custom formerly was superstitious but now may be used with innocence on the eve of st john baptist commonly called midsummer eve it is usual in the most of country places and also here and there in towns and cities for both old and young to meet together and be merry over a large fire which is made in the open street over this they frequently leap and play at various games such as running wrestling dancing etc but this is generally the exercise of the younger sort for the old ones for the most part sit by as spectators and enjoy themselves and their bottle and thus they spend the time till midnight and sometimes till cockcrow  belithus tells us consuetum item hac vigilia ardentes deferri faculas quod joannes fuerit ardens lucerna and qui domini vias praeparaverit belith explicat div offic c     p     and durand cap    lib   that it was a custom to carry lighted torches on midsummereve as an emblem of st john baptist who was a burning and a shining light and the preparer of the way of christ but if this was the reason of this custom formerly as it is probable it was it having been a common thing to shadow out times and seasons by emblems yet the custom still continued among us was originally instituted upon another bottom  and indeed the habent hoc a gentibus antiquitus enim dracones hoc tempore ad libidinem propter calorem excitati volando per aerem frequenter in puteos and fontes spermatizabant ex quo etc hoc animadvertentes medici ignes frequenter and passim circa fontes fieri and quaecunque magnum and immundum redderint fumum ibi cremari etc et quia talia hoc tempore maxim fiebant ideo hoc adhuc ab aliquibus observatur durand l   c    and belith in eodem fest original of this custom is heathenish for in ancient times the dragons being incited to lust through the heat of the season did frequently as they flew through the air spermatize in the wells and fountains by this means the water became infected and the air polluted so that whoever drank the waters was either tormented with a grievous distemper or lost his life as soon as the phycians perceived this th ordered fires to be made every where about the wells and fountains and those things which occasioned the noisomest smell to be burnt knowing that thereby the dragons would be driven away and forasmuch as this custom was observed about the time we now celebrate st john baptists feast it is therefore still observed among some people and agreeable to this it is that mr cambden tells us that barnwell a village near cambridge got its name from the children playing about a well on st john baptists eve  the custom of kindling such fires was severely censured by the church and therefore in the council of trullus this canon was made against it can    in synod trull ex bals p   0 that if any clergyman or layman observed the rite of making on fires on the new mood which some were wont to observe and according to an old custom to leap over them in a mad and foolish manner he should be deposed if the former if the latter he should be excommunicated  the scholiast upon this canon has these words the new mood was always the first day of the month and it was customary among the jews and greeks to hold then a feast and pray that they might be lucky during the continuance of the month of these it was that god spoke by the prophet my soul hates your new mons and your sabbaths and not only this but they also kindled fires before their shops and houses and leaped over them imagining that all the evils which had befallen them formerly would be burnt away and that they should be more successful and lucky afterward now about the sitting of this synod there were some of the christians who observed this custom upon the same accounts that the heathens did which occasioned it is being forbid by the council and that if a clergyman was guilty of it he should be deposed if a layman excommunicated he also tells us that on st john baptists eve the vulgar were wont to make on fires for the whole night and leap over them and draw lots and divine about their good or evil fortune  but whatever reason the heathens had for kindling these fires whether as durandus thinks that the lustful dragons might be driven away or as the canon that their evil fortune might be burnt it is certain that the custom was invented and practiced by them and because of the superstition attending the observation of it was very justly forbidden by the council and undoubtedly was the making of such fires now attended with any such superstition it would be equally criminal to observe them but rogos  quos nos angli bonefires vocamus and in publica laetitia and gaudiis adhibemus non obstante isto canone mountag p   0 when they are only kindled as tokens of joy to excite innocent mirth and diversion and promote peace and good neighborhood they are lawful and innocent and deserve no censure and therefore when on midsummereve st peterseve and at some other times we make i suppose they were called bonefires because that generally they were made of bones for as belithus tells us adversus haec ergo hujusmodi inventum est

bones that the smoke might drive away the dragons bonefires before shops and houses there would be no harm in doing so was it not that some continue their diversion to too late hours and others are

of innocence there really seems to be probability in this conjecture for not only the young and vigorous used to leap over them but even those of grave characters there was an interdiction of ecclesiastical authority to deter clergymen as mr bourne has told us from this superstitious instance of agility  this author tells us of a remarkable custom which he himself was an eyewitness of in scotland  atque hodie recens baptizatos infantes ut vidi fieri ab anicula in scotia olim quae sui papatus reliquias saperet statim atque domum redierint in limine oblatis eduliis been venire dicunt

three or four times gently over a flame saying and repeating thrice let the flame consume thee now or never  this too seems to favor his supposition that passing over fires was accounted expiatory  there was a feast at athens kept by private families called amphidromia on the  th day after the birth of the child when it was the custom for the gossips to run round the fire with the infant in their arms and then having delivered it to the nurse they were entertained with feasting and dancing  mr borlase in his account of cornwall tells us the cornish make bonefires in every village on the

hist dhercule p  0  can one says he overlook here the st john fires those sacred fires kindled about midnight on the very moment of the solstice by the greatest part both of ancient and modern nations a religious ceremony which goes backwards thus to the most remote antiquity and which was observed for the prosperity of states and people and to dispel every kind of evil  the origin of this fire still retained by so many nations and which loses itself in antiquity is very simple it was a feu de joie fire of joy kindled the very moment the year began for the first of all years and the most ancient that we know of began at the month of june thence the very name of this month junior the youngest which is renewed while that of the preceding one is may major the ancient thus the one was the month of young people the other that of old men  these feux de joie were accompanied at the same time with vows and sacrifices for the prosperity of the people and the fruits of the earth they danced also round this fire for what feast is there without a dance and the most active leaped over it leaping over the fires is mentioned among the superstitious rites used at the palilia in ovids fasti moxque per ardentes stipulae crepitantis acervos trajicias celeri strenua membra pede lib   l       each at their departure took away a greater or less firebrand and the remains were scattered to the wind which was to drive away every evil as it dispersed the ashes  when after a long train of years the solstice ceased to be the beginning of them the custom of making these fires was still continued at the same time through a train of use and of superstitious ideas which were annexed to it besides it would have been a sad thing to annihilate a day of joy in times when there were but few of them thus has the custom been continued and handed down to us  so far our learned and ingenious foreigner  but i by no means acquiesce with him in thinking that the leaping over these fires was only a trial of agility a great deal of learning might be produced here further to show that this was as much a religious act as the making them on  i have nothing to observe here concerning mr bournes lustful dragons their spermatizing in the wells or fountains as they flew through the air etc i find in j boemus aubanus description of the ceremonies of this eve in germany that a species of fireworks was played off which they who had never seen it before he says would take to be a dragon of fire flying ignis sit cui orbiculi quidam lignei perforati imponuntur qui quum inflammantur

shapes which fear has created to itself they who gave it life have it seems furnished it also with the feelings of animated nature but our modern philosophers are wiser than to attribute any noxious qualities in water to dragons sperm  n b stow tells us that the rites above described were used also on the eve of st peter and st paul the apostles the   th of june dr moresin informs us that in scotland they used on this night to run about on the mountains and higher grounds with lighted torches like the sicilian women of old in search of proserpine  i have been informed that something similar to this was practiced about half a century ago in northumberland on this night they carried some kind of firebrands about the fields of their respective villages they made encroachments on these occasions upon the bonefires of the neighboring towns of which they took forcibly some of the ashes this they called carrying off the flower probably the flour of the wake  moresin thinks this a vestige of the ancient cerealia  p       chap xxviii of the feast of sheepshearing an ancient custom the feast of sheepsheering is generally a time of mirth and joy and more than ordinary hospitality indeed it is but little observed in these northern parts but in the southern it is pretty common for on the day they begin to sheer their sheep they provide a plentiful dinner for the sheerers and for their friends who come to visit them on that occasion a table also if the weather permit is spread in the open village for the young people and children  after what manner soever this custom reached us it is certain it may boast of great antiquity it is mentioned in the second book of samuel as a feast of great magnificence both for grandeur of entertainment and greatness of company no less a person than absalom the kings son was the master of this feast and no less persons were the guests than the kings sons the brethren of absalom nay it was a feast that might entertain the king himself or surely the king would never have been so importuned never would have received the compliment so kindly for it is said it came to pass after two full years that absalom had sheepsheerers in baalhazor which is beside ephraim and absalom invited all the kings sons and absalom came to the king and said behold now thy servant has sheepsheerers let the king i beseech thee and his servants go with thy servant and the king said nay my son let us not all go lest we be chargeable unto thee of this kind also was the feast which nabal made for his sheerers when david was driven to straits in the wilderness and sent his servants to ask a present of him he calls the day it was held on a good day that is a day of plentiful eating and drinking and therefore nabal answered the servants of david shall i then take my bread and my water and my flesh that i have killed for my sheerers and give it unto men whom i know not whence they be and further it is said in the same chapter that so grand and magnificent was this feast that he had a feast in his house like the feast of a king we find also in the book of genesis that laban went to sheer his sheep in which time jacob made his escape which laban heard not of till the third day of such great antiquity then is this custom and though its antiquity is not of such force as to palliate luxury and profuseness in these entertainments yet no doubt it will vindicate the harmlesness of a moderate feast upon this occasion  observations on chapter xxviii the author of the convivial antiquities tells us that the pastoral life was anciently accounted an honorable one particularly amongst the jews and the romans apud latinos oves tondre ut et sementem facere omnino non fuit licitum priusquam catulatio hoc est ex cane

rursus atque exhilarare volucrunt antiquit conviv p       mr bourne has given us instances from the old testament of the festive entertainments of the former on this occasion pliny and varro may be consulted for the manner of celebrating this feast among the latter  the washing and shearing of sheep was attended among them with great mirth and festivity indeed the value of the covering of this very useful animal must have always made the shearing time in all pastoral nations a kind of harvest home  there is a beautiful description of this festivity in dyers fleece at the end of the first book at shearing time along the lively vales rural festivities are often heard beneath each blooming arbor all is joy and lusty merriment while on the grass the mingled youth in gaudy circles sport we think the golden age again returned and all the fabled dryades in dance leering they bound along with laughing air to the shrill pipe and deep remurmring cords of the ancient harp or tabors hollow sound while the old apart upon a bank reclined attend the tuneful carol softly mixed with every murmur of the sliding wave and every warble of the feathered choir music of paradise which still is heard when the heart listens still the views appear of the first happy garden when content to natures flowery scenes directs the sight  with light fantastic toe the nymphs thither assembled thither every swain and over the dimpled stream athousand flowers pale lilies roses violets and pinks mixed with the greens of burnet mint and thyme and trefoil sprinkled with their sportive arms such custom holds along the irriguous vales from wreakins brow to rocky dolvoryn sabrinas early haunt  the jolly cheer spread on a mossy bank untouched abides till cease the rites and now the mossy bank is gaily circled and the jolly cheer dispersed in copious measure early fruits and those of frugal store in husk or rind steeped grain and curdled milk with dulcet cream soft tempered in full merriment they quaff and cast about their gibes and some apace whistle to roundelays their little ones look on delighted while the mountain woods and winding valleys with the various notes of pipe sheep kine and birds and liquid brooks unite their echoes near at hand the wide majestic wave of severn slowly rolls along the deep divided glebe the flood and trading bark with low contracted sail linger among the reeds and copsy banks to listen and to view the joyous scene   thus also of the washing and shearing sheep in thompsons summer  in one diffusive band they drive the troubled flocks by many a dog compelled to where the mazyrunning brook forms a deep pool this bank abrupt and high and that fair spreading in a pebbled shore urged to the giddy brink much is the toil the clamor much of men and boys and dogs ere the soft fearful people to the flood commit their woolly sides and often the swain on some impatient seizing hurls them in emboldened then nor hesitating more fast fast they plunge amid the flashing wave and panting labor to the farther shore repeated this till deep the wellwashd fleece has drunk the flood and from his lively haunt the trout is banished by the sordid stream heavy and dripping to the breezy brow slow move the harmless race where as they spread their swelling treasures to the sunny ray inly disturbed and wondering what this wild outrageous tumult means their loud complaints the country tell and tossed from rock to rock incessant bleatings run around the hills at last of snowy white the gathered flocks are in the wattled pen innumerous pressed head above head and ranged in lusty rows the shepherds sit and whet the sounding shears the housewife waits to roll her fleecy stores with all her gay dressed maids attending round one chief in gracious dignity enthroned shines over the rest the pastral queen and rays her smiles sweetbeaming on her shepherd king while the glad circle round them yield their souls to festive mirth and wit that knows no

day in this chapter is a pleasant one he calls says he the day it was held on a good day that is a day of plentiful eating and drinking  by parity of reasoning the vulgar ceremony of wishing a good day to you is synonimous with wishing you a good dinner this calls to my remembrance the following curious passage in dr moresin ebrietati says he et gulae indulget papa diebus suis festis nam amplius largiusque rei divinae caussa invitare se credebatur fas unde et  inflexum arist putat quod ebrii fierent  id est post sacrificium quin dapes et convivia dictitabant  a  et  veluti deorum gratia amplius indulgendum foret cael lib   cap   ant lect p      chap xxix of michaelmass guardian angels the discourse of country people at this time that it seems rather true that we are protected by a number of angels than by one particular genius the feast of this season is celebrated in commemoration of st michael and all the orders of angels it is called the dedication of st michael because of a church being dedicated to him on this day in mount garganus  at this season of the year it is a general custom to elect the governors of towns and cities to promote peace among men and guard them against harm from their malicious fellow creatures whether this particular time of the year has been chosen for electing them because then is the feast of angels the guardians and protectors of men and of their communities and daniel c   provinces is not so certain it is certainer that when ever it comes it brings into the minds of the people that old opinion of tutelar angels that every man has his guardian angel that is one particular angel who attends him from his coming in till his going out of life who guides him through the troubles of the world and strives as much as he can to bring him to heaven  now that good angels attend good men is without dispute they guide them in the mazes of the wilderness of life and bring them to their desired homes they surround them in the seas of afflictions and lead them to the shores of peace and as when the israelites passed through the red sea the cloud became light to them but darkness to their enemies so in the troublesome seas of this life the angels are both the guides of good men and their protectors from evil from the devil and his angels and therefore the psalmist says the angel of the lord tarrieth round about them that fear him and delivers them and that he will give his angels charge over good men they are also supposed to be that hedge which god placed about job which the devil so much complains of and sure we are that when the eyes of elishas servant were opened he saw the mountain full of chariots and horses of fire round about elisha that therefore good men are guarded and protected by angels the scripture shows very clearly but that every man has his particular genius seems to be founded more upon tradition than any certainty from scripture thus the egyptians believed that every man had three angels attending him the pythagoreans that every man had two the romans that there was a good and an evil genius and hence it is that the roman poet says quisque suos patitur manes every man has his evil genius and if we may believe the authority of plutarch the evil genius of brutus appeared to him the night before the battle of philippi and told him he was his evil genius and that he would meet him there  but there are greater authorities than these in vindication of this opinion casalion observes it may be proved from scripture and not only from the tradition of the unicuique deus custodem apposuit and asserimus indubitanter nos ex scripturas illam fidem non gentium nugibus cassal     p de vet christ ri heathens and of this opinion was justin martyr theodoret st basil st jerome and st austin  there are indeed two places in the new testament which have a view to this opinion the first is in the   th of st matthew the  0th verse take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones for i say unto you that their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven now because this place takes notice of the angels of these little ones some have therefore concluded that every man has his good angel at least that good men have but now this conclusion does not certainly follow from these words for when it is said their angels it does indeed certainly infer that the angels do protect good men but not that every man has his particular angel and hence therefore as one observes st chrisostom makes use of these words enteuthen delon etc it is manifest that the saints at least if not all men have their angels but he does not hence conclude that every man has one the other place is in the acts of the apostles where it is said that when peter was delivered out of prison they would not believe the maid it was he but said it was his angel it must be owned indeed from this that it seems the opinion of those in the house that every man had his guardian angel but this is no proof of the things being so it only proves that it was their opinion but not that this opinion is true the jews had such a tradition among them and what was here spoken was perhaps only according to that tradition besides we read on the contrary that sometimes one and the same angel has been sent to different persons thus gabriel was sent to daniel zacharias and the blessed virgin sometimes the scripture tells us of many angels protecting one man for so was elisha protected and as we wrestle not only against flesh and blood but against all the powers of darkness so we have many angels to assist and defend us i shall not dare to determine positively against this opinion which has traveled down through so many ages which has been held by so many wise and learned men and which has such scriptures brought to its defense this i shall only say that of the two opinions the latter seems to be the more probable that it seems more consonant to scripture that we are attended by a number of angels than by a particular tutelar angel but this i mention not as necessary to be believed for i am persuaded there is no fault in believing either the one or the other as it appears more probable for whether soever we believe we believe in the protection of angels and that seems to be all which the scripture requires  observations on chapter xxix symmachus against the christians says the divine being has distributed various guardians to cities  as souls are communicated to infants at their birth so particular genii are assigned to particular societies of men  moresin tells us that papal rome in imitation of this tenet of gentilism has fabricated such kinds of genii for guardians and defenders of cities and people  thus she has assigned st andrew to scotland st george to england st dennis to france etc  egidius to edinburgh nicholas to aberdeen etc etc custodes varios ait symmachus in relatione ad valentinianum etc pro veteri deorum cultu adversus christianos urbibus and cultus mens divina distribuit ut animae nascentibus ita populis fatales genii dividuntur sic papa populis et urbibus consimiles fabricat cultus et genios custodes and defensores ut scotiae andream

peter succeeded to mars at the revolution of the religious creed of rome he now presides over the castle of st angelo as mars did over the ancient capitol  it is observable in this place how closely popery has in this respect copied the heathen mythology  she has the supreme being for jupiter and has substituted angels for genii  the souls of saints for heroes retaining all kinds of demons against these pests she has carefully provided her antidotes  she exorcises them out of waters she rids the air of them by ringing her hallowed bells etc  thus the pope like pluto of old may be said to preside over the infernal regions  the romanists in imitation of the heathens have assigned tutelar gods to each member of the body to professions apollini et aesculapio ejus filio datur morbo

heathens and regulated by gregory the great in the southern parts of this nation the most of country villages are wont to observe some sunday in a more particular manner than the other common sundays of the year viz the sunday after the day of dedication i e the sunday after the day of the saint to whom their church was dedicated then the inhabitants deck themselves in their gaudiest clothes and have open doors and splendid entertainments for the reception and treating of their relations and friends who visit them on that occasion from each neighboring town the morning is spent for the most part at church though not as that morning was wont to be spent not with the commemoration of the saint or martyr nor the grateful remembrance of the builder and endower the remaining part of the day is spent in eating and drinking and so is also a day or two afterward together with all sorts of rural pastimes and exercises such as dancing on the green wrestling cudgelling etc  agreeable to this we are told that formerly die dominica post encaeniam seu festum dedicationis cujusvis villae convenire solet in aurora magna hominum iuvenumque multitudo and canora voce holywakes holywakes exclamando designare etc spelm gloss in verb wak on the sunday after the encaenia or feast of the dedication of the church it was usual for a great number of the inhabitants of the village both grown and young to meet together about break of day and cry holywakes holywakes and after mattens to go to feasting and sporting which they continued for two or three days  in the northren parts the sundays feasting is almost lost and they observe only one other day for the whole which among them is called the hopping i suppose from the dancing and other exercises then used the ancient name and which is still common in the southern parts is the wake which according to sir h spelman are sunt celebritates bacchanales sub fructuum temporibus ab occiduiis and borealibus anglis pagatim habitae bacchanales dixi ex nomine nam wak sax est temulentia spelm ibid bacchanal feasts observed about fruit time and which were in villages by turns among the northern and western english he calls them bacchanals because as he observes the saxon word wak signifies drunkenness this custom our forefathers did in all probability borrow from their fellow heathens haec eadem sunt quae apud ethnicos paganalia dicebantur etc spelm ibid whose paganalia or country feasts were of the same stamp with this of the wake  at the conversion of the saxons by austin the monk it was continued among the converts with some regulations by an order of pope gregory the great to mellitus the abbot who accompanied austin in his voyage his words are these ut die dedicationis vel natalitiis sanctorum martyrrum quorum illic reliquiae ponuntur tabernacula sibi circa easdem ecclesias quae ex fanis commutatae sunt de ramis arborum faciant etc bed lib cap  0 on the day of dedication or the birthday of the holy martyrs whose relics are there placed let the people make to themselves booths of the boughs of trees round about those very churches which had been the temples of idols and in a religious way to observe a feast that beasts may no longer be slaughtered by way of sacrifice to the devil but for their own eating and the glory of god and that when they are full and satisfied they may return him thanks who is the giver of all good things  this then is the beginning of our country wakes but they continued not in their original purity for the feasting and sporting got the ascendant of religion and so this feast of dedication degenerated into drunkenness and luxury at present there is nothing left but the very refuse and dregs of it religion having not the least share in it which till these latter ages always had some rioting and feasting are now all that remain a scandal to the feast in particular and to christianity in general  observations on chapter xxx in the council held at magfield in the time of edward the third in the list of the principal holydays to be observed in england are the anniversaries of the consecration of churches and of the saints to whose memory they are dedicated vide colliers ecclesiastical history vol i p       the learned mr borlase in his account of cornwall speaking on this subject tells us the parish feasts instituted in commemoration of the dedication of the parochial churches were highly esteemed among the primitive christians and originally kept on the saints day to whose memory the church was dedicated the generosity of the founder and endower thereof was at the same time celebrated and a service composed suitable to the occasion this is still done in the colleges at oxford to the memory of the respective founders on the eve of this day prayers were said and hymns were sung all night in the church and from these watchings the festivals were styled wakes speght in his glossary to chaucer gives us a curious description of wakes  it was the manner in times past says he upon festival evens called vigiliae for parishioners to meet in their church houses or church yards and there to have a drinking fit for the time  here they used to end many quarrels between neighbor and neighbor hither came the wives in comely manner and they which were of the better sort had their mantles carried with them as well for show as to keep them from cold at the table these mantles also many did use in the church at morrow masses and other times  in the    canon given under king edgar preserved in whelocs edition of bid i find decent behavior enjoined at these church wakes the people are commanded to pray devoutly at them and not betake themselves to drinking or debauchery     and e laerath that man aet cyric aeccan spithe gedreoh sy and georne gebidde and aenige dren ne aenig unnit tharne dreoge  this seems to oppose the opinion of spelman that wakes are derived as bourne ctes  from the saxon word wak which signifies drunkenness    which name still continues in many parts of england though the vigils have been long abolished  it being found very inconvenient especially in harvest time to observe the parish feast on the saints day they were by the bishops special authority transferred to the following sunday and at length in the   th year of henry viii it was injoined that they should be always every where celebrated on the first sunday in october and no other day which injunction was never universally complied with custom in this case prevailing against the law of the land  these feasts he continues have been much exclaimed against by those who do not duly distinguish between the institution itself and the degenerate abuse of it  when the order was made in      and      at exeter and in somersetshire for their suppression both the ministers and the people desired their continuance not only for preserving the memorial of the dedication of their several churches but for civilizing their parishioners composing differences by the mediation and meeting of friends increasing of love and unity by these feasts of charity and for the relief and comfort of the poor  mr strutt gives us a pertinent quotation on this subject from dugdales warwickshire from an old ms legend of st john the baptist and ye shall understond and know how the evyns were furst found in old time in the beginning of holy church it was so that the pepul came to the church with candellys brennyng and would wake and coome with light toward to the church in their devocions and after they fell to lechery and songs bishop hall in his triumphs of rome alludes thus to these convivial entertainments what should i speak of our merry wakes and may games and christmas triumphs which you have once seen here and may see still in those under the roman dition in all which put together you may well say no greek can be merrier than they triumph of pleasure p    daunces harping piping and also to glotony and sin and so turned the holiness to cursydness wherefore holy faders ordained the pepul to leve that waking and to fast the evyn but hit is called vigilia that is waking in english and it is called evyn for at evyn they were wont to come to church  this quotation also seems to overthrow the etymology of wake given from spelman by our author  this ingenious antiquary deduces the origin of our fairs from these ancient wakes where great numbers attending by degrees less devotion and reverence were observed till at length from hawkers and pedlars coming thither to sell their petty wares the merchants came and set up stalls and booths in the churchyards and not only those says spelman who lived in the parish to which the church belonged resorted thither but others from all the neighboring towns and villages and the greater the reputation of the saint the greater were the numbers that flocked together on this occasion  keeping these fairs on sundays was justly found fault with by the clergy the abbot of ely in johns reign preached much against such profanation of the sabbath but this irreligious custom was not entirely abolished till the reign of king henry the sixth see strutts english era vol ii p    see article fairs in the appendix  these meetings are still kept up under the name of hoppings hopping is derived from the anglo saxon poppan to leap or dance which skinner deduces from the dutch huppe

skinner in verb hop dancings are here vulgarly called hops  the word in its original meaning is preserved in grass hopper  in many of our northern villages  we shall hope the rejoicings on them are still in general restrained within the bounds of innocent festivity though it is to be feared they sometimes prove fatal to the morals of our swains and to the innocence of our rustic maids  chap xxxi of the harvest supper a custom of the heathens taken from the jewish feast of tabernacles when the fruits of the earth are gathered in and laid in their proper receptacles it is common in the most of country places to provide a plentiful supper for the harvestmen and the servants of the family which is called a harvestsupper and in some places a mellsupper a churnsupper etc at this the servant and his master are alike and every thing is done with an equal freedom they sit at the same table converse freely together and spend the remaining part of the night in dancing singing etc without any difference or distinction  there antiquitus consuetudo fuit apud gentiles quod hoc mense servi pastores and ancillae quadam liberate fruerentur et cum dominis suis dominarentur and cum eiis facerent festa and convivia post collectas messes durand rat lib   cap    was a custom among the heathens much like this at the gathering in of their harvest when servants were indulged with liberty and being on the equality with their masters for a certain time  now the original of both these custom is jewish and therefore hospinian tells us et pro collectis frugibus deo gratiae agebantur quem morem ethnici postea ab iis mutuati sunt hospin de orig fest jud stukius antiq convival p    that the heathens copied after this custom of the jews and at the end of their harvest offered up their first fruits to the gods for the jews rejoiced and feasted at the getting in of the harvest  theophylact in talking of this feast is undoubtedly mistaken when he says scenopegia quod celebrant in gratiarum actionem propter convectas fruges in mense septembri tunc enim gratias agebant deo convectis omnibus fructibus etc theophylact in   cap joan that the feast of tabernacles was celebrated that thanks might be returned for the getting in of the fruits of the earth for god himself tells his own people it was instituted levit     that their generations might know that he had made the children of israel to dwell in booths but however it is certainly true that it was a time of returning thanks to god for the success of the harvest a time of festivity and joy and gladness thus the scripture deuteronomy    thou shall observe the feast of tabernacles seven days after thou have gathered in thy corn and thy wine and thou shall rejoice in thy feast thou and thy son and thy daughter and thy manservant and thy maidservant and the levite the stranger and the fatherless and the widow that are within thy gates  now as the heathens have imitated the jews in this custom so it is not improbable that we have had it from the heathens there being a very great likeness between the custom now and that of the heathens formerly for macrobius tells us that patres familiarum and frugibus and fructibus jam coactis passim cum servis vescerentur cum quibus patientiam laboris in colendo rure toleraverant macreb saturnal die prim cap  0 the masters of families when they had got in their harvest were wont to feast with their servants who had labored with them in tilling the ground which is exactly answerable to the custom now amongst us but whatever truth there is in this it is certain this custom was practiced by the saxons and is at least as ancient among us as their days for among their holy days we find a elstob append p  0 week set a part at harvest of which our harvesthome and mellsupper in the north are the only remains  here end the antiquitates vulgares  observations on chapter xxxi vacina  aliter vacuna a vacando the tutelar deity as it were of rest and ease among the ancients was the name of the goddess to whom the rustics sacrificed at the conclusion of harvest  moresin vacina dea cui sacrificabant agricolae mess peracta papatus fert domum spiceas

rheda imaginem circum cantantibus promiscue viris et foeminis praecedente tibicine aut tympano deprav rel orig in verbo vacina tells us that popery in imitation of this brings home her chaplets of corn which she suspends on poles that offerings are made on the altars of her tutelar gods while thanks are returned for the collected stores and prayers are put up for future rest and ease images too of straw or stubble he tells us are wont to be carried about on this occasion and in england he himself saw the country people bringing home in a cart i suppose from the field a figure made of corn round which men and women promiscuously singing followed a piper or a drum  a vestage of this custom is still preserved in some places in the north not half a century ago they used every where to dress up something similar to the figure above described at the end of harvest which was called a kern baby i had this information from an old woman at a village in northumberland  the reader may perhaps smile but i am not ashamed of my evidence in a case of this nature old women are respectable authorities  this northern word is plainly a corruption of corn baby or image as is the kern or churn supper of corn supper this as mr bourne tells us is called also a mellsupper plainly i think from the french mesler to mingle or mix together the master and servants sitting promiscuously at the same table all being upon an equal footing or as our northern vulgar idiom has it hailfellow well met  amell is commonly used here for betwixt or among i find indeed that many of our northumbrian rustic and vulgar words are derived to us from the french perhaps we have not imported them from the first market but have had them at second hand from the scots a people that in former times were greatly connected with that nation   this feast is undoubtedly of the most remote antiquity in the ancient roman calendar so often cited i find the following observations on the eleventh of june the harvests in italy are much earlier than with us the season of reapers and their custom with rustic pomp messorum aestas et eorum consuetudo cum agresti pompa  that men in all nations where agriculture flourished should have expressed their joy on this occasion by some outward ceremony has its foundation in the nature of things sowing is hope reaping fruition of the expected good to the husbandman whom the fear of wet blights etc had harassed with great anxiety the completion of his wishes could not fail of imparting an enviable gust of delight  festivity is but the reflex of inward joy and it could hardly fail of being produced on this occasion which is a temporary suspension of every care  the respect shown to servants mr pennant informs us that a custom prevails in gloucestershire on the twelfthday or on the epiphany in the evening all the servants of every particular farmer assemble together in one of the fields that has been sown with wheat on the border of which in the most conspicuous or most elevated place they make twelve fires of straw in a row around one of which made larger than the rest they drink a cheerful glass of cider to their masters health success to the future harvest etc then returning home they feast on cakes made of carraways etc soaked in cider which they claim as a reward for their past labors in sowing the grain  this he observes seems to resemble a custom of the ancient danes who in their addresses to their rural deities emptied on every invocation a cup in honor of them niordi et frejae memoria poculis recolebatur annua ut ipsis contingeret felicitas frugumque et reliquae annonae uberrimus proventus  worm monument dan lib   p    see note in pennants tour p    dr johnson tells us that he saw the harvest of a small field in one of the western islands  the strokes of the sickle were timed by the modulation of the harvest song in which all their voices were united  they accompany in the highlands every action which can be done in equal time with an appropriated strain which has they say not much meaning but its effects are regularity and cheerfulness the ancient proceleusmatic song by which the rowers of galleys were animated may be supposed to have been of this kind there is now an oar song used by the hebridians  thus far the learned traveller our sailors at newcastle in heaving their anchors etc use a song of this kind   at this season seems to have sprung from a grateful sense of their good services  every thing depends at this juncture upon their labor and dispatch  different places adopt different ceremonies  there is a sport on this occasion in hertfordshire called crying the mare when the reapers tie together the tops of the last blades of corn which is mare and standing at some distance throw their sickles at it and he who cuts the knot has the prize with acclamations and good cheer mr blount tells us farther that after the knot is cut then they cry with a loud voice three times i have her others answer as many times what have you  a mare a mare a mare whose is she thrice also j b naming the owner three times whither will you send her to jo a nicks naming some neighbor who has not all his corn reaped then they all shout three times and so the ceremony ends with good cheer in yorkshire upon the like occasion they have a harvest dame in bedfordshire a jack and a gill blount in verbo vide bailey  mr thompson has left us a beautiful description of this annual festivity of harvesthome  his words are these  the harvesttreasures all now gathered in beyond the rage of storms sure to the swain the circling fence shut up and instant winters utmost rage defied while loose to festive joy the country round laughs with the loud sincerity of mirth shook to the wind their cares the toilstrung youth by the quick sense of music taught alone leaps wildly graceful in the lively dance her every charm abroad the village toast young buxom warm in native beauty rich darts not unmeaning looks and where her eye points an approving smile with double force the cudgel rattles and the wrestler twines age too shines out and garrulous recounts the feats of youth thus they rejoice nor think that with tomorrows sun their annual toil begins again the never ceasing round autumn line       appendix of pasche or as they are commonly called paste eggs ab ovo  horat eggs stained with various colors in boiling and sometimes covered with leafgold are at easter presented to children at newcastle and other places in the north  they ask for their paste eggs as for a fairing at this season  this custom which had its beginning in childish superstition seems to be ending in a way not unsuitable to its origin  paste is plainly a corruption of pasche coals in his latin dictionary renders the pasch or easter egg by  ovum paschale croceum seu luteum it is plain from hence that he has been acquainted with the custom of dying or staining eggs at this season  ainsworth leaves out these two epithets and calls it singly ovum paschale  he has known nothing i presume of this ancient custom and has therefore omitted the croccum or luteum  it is in this manner that many of our english dictionaries have been improved in modern editions   easter  this also is a relic of popish superstition which for whatever cause had made eggs emblematic of the resurrection as may be gathered from the subsequent prayer subveniat quaesumus domine tuae benedictionis gratia huic ovorum creaturae ut cibus salubris fiat fidelibus tuis in tuarum gratiarum action sumentibus ob resurrectionem domini nostri jesu christi qui tecum etc p      in the romish beehive fol    i find the following catalogue of popish superstitions in which the reader will find our paste eggs very properly included  many traditions of idle heads which the holy church of rome has received for a perfect serving of god as fasting days years of grace differences and diversities of days of meats of clothing of candles holy ashes holy pace eggs and flames palms and palm boughs staves fools hoods shells and bells relative to pilgrimages licking of rotten bones relics etc etc   which the reader will find in an extract from the ritual of pope paul the vth made for the use of england ireland and scotland  it contains various other forms of benediction   bless o lord we beseech thee this thy creature of eggs that it may become a wholesome sustenance to thy faithful servants eating it in thankfulness to thee on account of the resurrection of our lord jesus christ who with thee and the holy spirit etc  the ancient egyptians if the resurrection of the body had been a tenet of their faith would perhaps have thought an egg no improper hieroglyphical representation of it  the exclusion of a living creature by incubation after the vital principle has lain a long while dormant or extinct is a process so truly mavelous that if it could be disbelieved would be thought by some a thing as incredible as that the author of life should be able to reanimate the dead  i conjecture that the romanists borrowed this custom from the jews who in celebrating their passover set on the table two unleavened cakes and two pieces of the lamb to this they added some small fishes because of the leviathan a hard egg because of the bird ziz some meal because of the behemoth these three animals being according to their rabbinical doctors appointed for the feast of the elect in the other life  this custom still prevails in the greek church dr chandler in his travels in asia minor gives us the following account of the manner of celebrating easter among the modern greeks the greeks now celebrated easter a small bier prettily decked with orange and citronbuds jasmine flowers and boughs was placed in the church with a christ crucified rudely painted on board for the body we saw it in the evening and before day break were suddenly awakened by the blaze and crackling of a large bonefire with singing and shouting in honor of the resurrection  they made us presents of colored eggs and cakes of easter bread probably the cross buns made at present on good friday have been derived from these or such like cakes of easter bread the country people in the north make with a knife many little crossmarks on their cakes before they put them into the oven etc  i have no doubt but that this too trifling as the remark may appear is a relic of popery thus also persons who cannot writ instead of signing their names are bid to make their mark which is generally done in the form of a cross   easter day says the abbe d auteroche in his journey to siberia is set apart for visiting in russia  a russian came into my room offered me his hand and gave me at the same time an egg  another succeeded he embraced me and also gave me an egg i gave him in return the egg i had just received the men go to each others houses in the morning and introduce themselves into the houses by saying jesus christ is risen the answer is yes he is risen the people then embrace give each other eggs and drink a great deal of brandy  this corresponds pretty much with the subsequent account of far older date which i transcribe from hakluyts voyages      black letter page      they the russians have an order at easter which they always observe and that is this  every year against easter to die or color red with brazzel brazil wood a great number of eggs of which every man and woman gives one unto the priest of their parish upon easter day in the morning and moreover the common people use to carry in their hands one of these red eggs not only upon easter day but also three or four days after and gentlemen and gentlewomen have eggs gilaed doctor chandler in his travels in greece tells us that at the city of zante he saw a woman in a house with the door open bewailing her little son whose dead body lay by her dressed the hair powdered the face painted and bedecked with leafgold  in the ancient calendar of the romish church to which i have so often referred i find the subsequent observation on the   th of march which i confess myself entirely at a loss how to translate  ova annunciatae ut aiunt reponuntur   which they carry in like manner  they use it as they say for a great love and in token of the resurrection whereof they rejoice for when two friends meet during the easter holy days they come and take one another by the hand the one of them says the lord or christ is risen the other answers it is so of a truth and then they kiss and exchange their eggs both men and women continuing in kissing four days together  our ancient voyage writer means no more it should seem than that the ceremony was kept up for four days  ray has preserved an old english proverb on this subject i will warrant you for an egg at easter  of tobacco non fumum ex fulgore sed ex fumo dare lucem cogitat horat a foreign weed which has made so many englishmen especially of the common sort become its slaves must not be omitted in our catalogue of popular antiquities  captain r greenfield and sir francis drake are said to have been the first who brought tobacco into this kingdom about the year      during the reign of elizabeth  a pleasant kind of tale is given us in the athenian oracle by way of accounting for the frequent use and continuance of taking it  when the christians first discovered america the devil was afraid of losing his hold of the people there by the appearance of christianity he is reported to have told some indians of his acquaintance that he had found a way to be revenged upon the christians for beating up his quarters for he would teach them to take tobacco to which when they had once tasted it they should be perpetual slaves  our british solomon james the is it who was a great opponent of the devil and even wrote a book against witchcraft made a formidable attack also upon this invention of satan in a learned performance which he called a counterblaste to tobacco his majesty in the course of his work informs us that some of the gentry of the land bestowed at that time three some four hundred pounds a year upon this precious stink  an incredible sum especially when we consider the value of money in his time they must not have been sterling but scotch pounds  the following extraordinary account of a buckinghamshire parson who abandonned himself to the use of tobacco is worth quoting it may be found in lillys history of his life and times p     in this year also william bredon parson or vicar of thornton in bucks was living a profound divine but absolutely the most polite person for nativities in that age strictly adhering to ptolomy which he well understood he had a hand in composing sir christopher heydons defense of judicial astrology being at that time his chaplain he was so given over to tobacco and drink that when he had no tobacco and i suppose too much drink he would cut the bellropes and smoke them    it is printed in the edition of his work by barker and bill london       he concludes this bitter blast how widely different the strains of the subsequent parody little tube of mighty power charmer of an idle hour object of my warm desire lip of wax and eye of fire and thy snowy taper waist with my finger gently braced and thy pretty swelling crest with my little stopper pressed etc the style of that puling bard ambrose phillips is here ridiculed  as is also that of the subsequent imitation of dr young critics avaunt tobacco is my theme tremble like hornets at the blasting steam and

knowledge love the tree yet crowds remain who still its worth proclaim while some for pleasure smoke and some for fame fame of our actions universal spring for which we drink eat sleep smoke  every thing both of these were written by hawkins brown esquire   of his his sulphurous invective against this transmarine weed with the following peroration have you not reason then to be ashamed and to forbear this filthy novelty so basely grounded so foolishly received and so grossly mistaken in the right use thereof in your abuse thereof sinning against god harming yourselves both in persons and goods and taking also thereby look to ye that take snuff in profusion the marks and notes of vanity upon you by the custom thereof making yourselves to be wondered at by all foreign civil nations and by all strangers that come among you to be scorned and contemned a custom loathsome to the eye hateful to the nose harmful to the brain dangerous to the lungs and in the black stinking fume thereof nearest resembling the horrible stygian smoke of the pit that is bottomless  if even this small specimen of our learned monarchs oratory which seems well adapted to the understanding of old women does not prevail upon them all to break in pieces their tobacco pipes and forego smoking it will perhaps be impossible to say what can  the subject as his majesty well observes is smoke and no doubt many of his readers will think his arguments but the fumes of an idle brain and it may be added too of an empty head  of witches devovet absentes simulachraque cerea fingit et miserum tenues in jecur urget acus ovid witch is derived from the dutch witchelen which signifies whinnying and neighing like a horse in a secondary sense also to foretell and prophecy because the germans as tacitus informs us used to divine and foretell things to come by the whinnying and neighing of their horses there is a superstitious custom among some people of nailing horseshoes on the threshold to keep out witches  to break the eggshell after the meat is out is a relic of superstition thus mentioned in pliny huc pertinet ovorum ut exorbuerit quisque calices protinus frangi aut eosdem coclearibus perforari  dr brown tells us that the intent of this was to prevent witchcraft for lest witches should draw or prick their names therein and veneficiously mischief their persons they broke the shell as dalecampius has observed vide vulg errors  mr pennant tells us in his tour in scotland that the farmers carefully preserve their cattle against witchcraft by placing boughs of the mountain ash and honey suckle in their cowhouses on the  d of may  they hope to preserve the milk of their cows and their wives from miscarriage by tying red threads about them they bleed the supposed witch to preserve themselves from her charms    his very words are hinnitu and fremitu  perkins defines witchcraft to be an art serving for the working of wonders by the assistance of the devil so far as god will permit  delrio defines it to be an art in which by the power of a contract entered into with the devil some wonders are wrought which pass the common understanding of men lib   cap   de mag disq vide blount  witchcraft in modern estimation is a kind of sorcery especially in women in which it is ridiculously supposed that an old woman by entering into a contract with the devil is enabled in many instances to change the course of nature to raise winds perform actions that require more than human strength and to afflict those that offend her with the sharpest pains etc  in those times of more than egyptian darkness he tells us also that the last instance of these frantic executions for witchcraft in the north of scotland was in june      as that in the south was at paisly in      where among others a woman young and handsome suffered and with a reply to her enquiring friends worthy a roman matron  being asked why she did not make a better defense on her trial she answered my persecutors have destroyed my honor and my life is not now worth the pains of defending he goes on the last instance of national credulity on this head was the story of the witches of thurso who tormenting for a long time an honest fellow under the usual form of cats at last provoked him so that one night he put them to flight with his broad sword and cut off the leg of one less nimble than the rest on his taking it up to his amazement he found it belonged to a female of his own species and next morning discovered the owner an old hag with only the companion leg to this  but these relations of almost obsolete superstitions must never be thought a reflection on this country as long as any memory remains of the tragical end of the poor people at tring who within a few miles of our capital itself in      fell a sacrifice to the belief of the common people in witches or of that ridiculous imposture in the capital itself in      of the cocklane ghost which found credit with all ranks of people note p      he farther observes that at edinburgh there is still shown a deep and wide hollow beneath calton hill the place where those imaginary criminals witches and sorcerers were burnt in less enlightened times  the ingenious artist hogarth in his medley represents with great spirit of satire a witch sucked by a cat and flying on a broomstick it being said as trusler remarks that the familiar with whom a witch converses sucks her right breast in shape of a little dun cat as smooth as a mole which when it has sucked the witch is in a kind of trance vide hogarth moralized p        when ignorance and superstition overspread the world many severe laws were made against witches by which to the disgrace of humanity great numbers of innocent persons distressed with poverty and age were brought to violent and untimely ends  the witchact a disgrace to the code of english laws was not repealed till the year       lord verulam that sun of science that rose upon our island and dispelled an hereditary night of ignorance and superstition gives us the following reflections on witches in the  0th century of his natural history they form a fine contrast to the narrow and bigoted ideas of the royal author of the demonology  men may not too rashly believe the confession of witches nor yet the evidence against them for the witches themselves are imaginative and believe oftentimes they do that which they do not and people are credulous in that point and ready to impute accidents and natural operations to witchcraft  it is worthy the observing that both in ancient and late times as in the thessalian witches and the meetings of witches that have been recorded by so many late confessions the great wonders which they tell of carrying in the air transforming themselves into other bodies etc are still reported to be wrought not by incantation or ceremonies but by ointments and anointing themselves all over  this may justly move a man to think that these fables are the effects of imagination for it is certain that ointments do all if they be laid on any thing thick by stopping of the pores shut in the vapors and send them to the head extremely and for the particular ingredients of those magical ointments it is like they are opiate and soporiferous for anointing of the forehead neck feet backbone we know is used for procuring dead sleeps and if any man say that this effect would be better done by inward potions answer may be made that the medicines which go to the ointments are so strong that if they were used inwards they would kill those that use them and therefore they work potently though outward he tells us elsewhere  the ointment that witches use is reported to be made of the fat of children dug out of their graves of the juices of

the time of lord verulam no small stir concerning witchcraft  ben johnson says dr percy has left us a witch song which contains an extract from the various incantations  classic antiquity some learned wiseacres had just before  themselves on this subject with our british solomon james  at their head  and these had so ransacked all writers ancient d modern and so blended and kneaded together the several suerstitions of different times and nations that those of genuine nglish growth could no longer be traced out and distinguished  it was a supposed remedy against witchcraft to put some of the witched persons water with a quantity of pins needles and ails into a bottle cork them up and set them before the fire  order to confine the spirit but this sometimes did not prove fficient as it would often force the cork out with a loud noise ke that of a pistol and cast the contents of the bottle to a consirable height  bewitched persons are said to fall frequently into violent fits d vomit needles pins stones nails stubbs wool and straw  truslers hogarth moralized  at medley     the sabbath of witches is a nocturnal assembly supposed to be held on saturday in which the devil is said to appear in the shape of a goat about which they make several dances and magic ceremonies in order to prepare themselves for this meeting they take several soporific drugs after which they are fancied to fly up the chimney and to be spirited or carried through the air riding on a switch to their sabbath assembly hence the idea of witches on broomsticks etc the author of the gentle shepherd a beautiful pastoral in the ch language that equals perhaps the idyllia of theocritus has made great use of this superstition  he introduces a clo telling the powers of a witch in the following words she can overcast the night and cloud the moon and make the deils obedient to her crune at midnight hours over the kirkyards she raves and howks unchristend weans out of their graves boils up their livers in a warlocks pow rins withershins about the hemlocks low and seven times does her prayers backwards pray till plotcok comes with lumps of lapland clay mixed with the venom of black taids and

represent is felt and yonder is mause  she and her cat sit beeking in her yard etc   afterward he describes the ridiculous opinions of the count people who never fail to surmise that the commonest

addin known or could he have read this how fine a subject would have afforded him on which to have displayed his inimitable lent for criticism     a cat too is the sine qua non of a witch  these animals were anciently revered as emblem of the moon and among the egyptians we on that account so highly honored as to rceive sacrifices and devotions and had state temples erected to their honor it is said tha in whatever house a cat died all the family shaved their eyebrows herodotus and diodorus siculus relate that a roman happening accidentally to kill a cat the mob immediately gathered about the house where he was and neither the entreaties of some principal men sent by the king nor the fear of the romans with whom they were then negotiating a peace could save the mans life vide bailey  hence no doubt they have been taken and adopted into the species of superstition under consideration  mr strutt in his description of the ordeals under the saxons tells us that the second kind of ordeal by water was to thrust the accused into a deep water where if he struggled in the least to keep himself on the surface he was accounted guilty but if he remained on the top of the water without motion he was acquitted with honor hence he observes without doubt came the long continued custom of swimming people suspected of witchcraft  there are also he observes farther the faint traces of these ancient customs in another superstitious method of proving a witch it was done by weighing the suspected party against the church bible which if they outweighed they were innocent but on the contrary if the bible proved the heaviest they were instantly condemned  however absurd and foolish these superstitious customs may seem to the present age little more he observes than a century ago there were several unhappy wretches not only apprehended but also cruelly burnt alive for witchcraft on very little better evidence than the above ridiculous trials several great and learned men have also taken vast pains to convince the doubting age of the real existence of witches and the justness of their executions but so very unbelieving we are grown at present in these and such like stories as to consider them only as the idle phantoms of a fertile imagination  the ephialtes or night mare is called by the common people witchriding this is in fact an old gothic or scandinavian

the fourth sunday in lent says wheatly on the common prayer is generally called midlent though bishop sparrow and some others term it dominica refectionis the sunday of refreshment the reason perhaps is because the gospel for the day treats of our saviors feeding miraculously five thousand or else from the first lesson in the morning which gives us the story of josephs entertaining his brethren  he is of opinion that the appointment of these scriptures upon this day might probably give the first rise to a custom still retained in many parts of england and well known by the name of midlenting

church it being the custom for people in popish times to visit their mother church on midlent sunday and to make their offerings at the high altar   is preserved in the subsequent account of an

the french douzain and we dozen  and i am informed he says by merchants etc that in the number weight and measure of many things the hundred among us still consists of that greater tolfraedic hundred which is composed of ten times twelve  hence then without doubt is derived to us the present mode of reckoning many things by six score to the hundred  of the truelove knot a knot among the ancient northern nations seems to have been the symbol of love faith and friendship pointing out the indissoluble tie of affection and duty  thus the ancient runic inscriptions are in the form of a knot see hickes thesaurus in his autem monumentis ut et in id genus fere omnibus inscriptionum runae in nodis sive gyris nodorum insculptae leguntur propterea quod apud veteres septentrionales gentes nodus

knot a mutual present between the lover and his mistress which being considered as the emblem of plighted fidelity is therefore called a truelove knot  the epithet is not derived as one would naturally suppose it to be from the words true and love but from the danish verb trulofa thus also in the islandic gospels  in matthew chap  st is the following passage which confirms beyond the possibility of a doubt the sense here given til einrar meyar er trulofad var einum manne etc i e to a virgin espoused that is who was promised or had engaged herself to a man etc  fidem do i plight my faith  it is undoubtedly from hence that the bridefavours or the topknots at marriages which were considered as emblems of the ties of duty and affection between the bride and her spouse have been derived  mr gay in his pastoral entitled the spell thus beautifully describes the rustic manner of knitting this truelove knot as lubberkin once slept beneath a tree i twitched his dangling garter

it is generally believed that the custom of saluting or blessing upon that motion derives its origin from a disease wherein such as sneezed died  carolus sigonius in his history of italy mentions a pestilence in the time of gregory the great that proved mortal to such as sneezed  the custom has an elder era apulcius mentions it  00 years before  pliny it is said that tiberius the emperor otherwise a very four man would perform this rite most punctually to others and expect the same from others to himself also in the problem cur sternutantes salutantur petronius arbiter petronius arbiter who lived before them both has these words gyton collectione spiritus plenus ter continuo ita sternutavit ut grabatum concuteret ad quem motum eumolpus conversus salvere gytona jubet too describes it  caelius rhodiginus has an example of it among the greeks in the time of cyrus the younger when consulting about their retreat it chanced that one of them sneezed at the noise whereof the rest of the soldiers called upon jupiter soler  in the greek anthology non potis est proclus digitis emungere nasum namque est pro nasi mole pusilla manus non vucat ille jovem sternutans quippe nec audit sternutamentum tam procul aure sonat  it is alluded to in an epigram  it is received at this day in the remotest parts of africa so we read in codignus that upon a sneeze of the emperor of monomotapha there passed acclamations successively through the city  and as remarkable an example there is of the same custom in the remotest parts of the east in the travels of pinto   the history of it will run much higher if we take in the rabbinical account that sneezing was a mortal sign even from the first man until it was taken off by the special supplication of jacob from whence as a thankful acknowledgement this salutation first began and was after continued by the expression of tobim chaiim or vita bona by standers by upon all occasions of sneezing buxtorf lex chald   dr brown himself supposes that the ground of this ancient custom was the opinion the ancients held of sternutation which they generally conceived to be a good sign or a bad and so upon this motion accordingly used a salve or  as a gratulation for the one and a deprecation from the other  he then gives their physical sneezing being properly a motion of the brain suddenly expelling through the nostrils what is offensive to it it cannot but afford some evidence of its vigor and therefore says aristotle they that hear it  honor it as something sacred and a sign of sanity in the diviner part and this he illustrates from the practice of physicians who in persons near death use sternutatories medicines to provoke sneezing when if the faculty arise and sternutation ensues they conceive hopes of life and with gratulation receive the signs of safety notions of it  hippocrates says that sneezing cures the hiccup is profitable to parturient women in lethargies apoplexies catalepsies and comas it is bad and pernicious in diseases of the chest in the beginning of catarrhs in new and tender conceptions for then it endangers abortion  to these succeed their superstitious and augurial ones st austin tells us that the ancients were wont to go to bed again if they sneezed while they put on their shoe aristotle has a problem why sneezing from noon to midnight was good but from night to noon unlucky eustathius upon homer observes that sneezing to the left was unlucky but prosperous to the right see plutarch in the life of themistocles when themistocles sacrificed in his galley before the battle of xerxes and one of the assistants upon the right hand sneezed euphrantides the southsayer presaged the victory of the greeks and the overthrow of the persians   i shall give the whole of his conclusion thus we may perceive the custom to be more ancient than is commonly thought  and these opinions hereof in all ages not any one disease to have been the occasion of this salute and deprecation arising at first from this vehement and affrighting motion of the brain from whence some finding dependant effects to ensue others ascribing hereto as a cause what perhaps but casually or inconnexedly succeeded they might proceed into forms of speeches felicitating the good and deprecating the evil to follow  of royaloak day on the   th of may may the   th says the author of the festa

stands in need of they are generally kept once or twice in a year proclamation is to be made how long they are to continue and no person shall sell any goods after the time of the fair is ended on forfeiture of double the value  a toll is usually paid at fairs  in the first volume of the ingenious mr whartons hist of poetry p     there is a note which contains a great deal of learning on this subject the subsequent extracts will requite the pains of perusal and throw no small light upon this ancient kind of mart  before flourishing towns he tells us were established and the necessaries or ornaments of life from the convenience of communication and the increase of provincial civility could be procured in various places goods and commodities of every kind were chiefly sold at fairs here pedlars stalls with glittering toys are laid the various fairings of the country maid long silken laces hang upon the twine and rows of pins and amber bracelets shine here the tight lass knives combs and scissars spies and looks on thimbles with desiring eyes the mountebank now treads the stage and sells his pills his balsams and his ague spells now over and over the nimble tumbler springs and on the rope the venurous maiden swings jack pudding in his party colored jacket tosses the glove and jokes at every packet here raree shows are seen and punches feats and pockets picked in crowds and various cheats gay the ancient northern nations held annual ice fairs see olaus magnus  we also have heard of a fair upon the thames in a very hard frost    to these as to one universal mart the people resorted periodically and supplied most of their wants for the ensuing year  the display of merchandise and the conflux of customers at these principal and almost only emporia of domestic commerce were prodigious and they were therefore often held on open and extensive plains thus at newcastle on our town moor the cowbill  one of the chief of them was that of st giless hill or down near winchester the conqueror instituted and gave it as a kind of revenue to the bishop of winchester it was at first for three days but afterward by henry iii prolonged to sixteen days  its jurisdiction extended seven miles round and comprehended even southampton then a capital and trading town merchants who sold wares at that time within that circuit forfeited them to the bishop officers were placed at a considerable distance at bridges thus at present at newcastle at our gates also  and other avenues of access to the fair to exact toll of all merchandise passing that way in the mean while all shops in the city of winchester were shut a court called the pavilion composed of the bishops justiciaries and other officers had power to try causes of various sorts for seven miles round the bishop had a toll of every load or parcel of goods passing through the gates of the city on st giless eve the mayor etc delivered up the keys of the four gates to the bishops officers many and extraordinary were the privileges granted to the bishop on this occasion all tending to obstruct trade and oppress the people  numerous foreign merchants it appears that the justiciaries of the pavilion and the treasurers of the bishops palace received annually for a fee according to ancient custom four basins and ewers of those foreign merchants who sold brazen vessels in the fair and were called mercatores diaunteres ibid frequented this fair several streets were formed in it assigned to the sale of different commodities called the drapery the pottery the spicery etc thus we say now the cloth fair the shoe fair etc  the surrounding monasteries had shops or houses in these streets used only at the fair they held them under the bishop and they often were let by lease for a term of years  in the revenue roll of bishop william of waynflete an      this fair appears to have greatly decayed in which among other proofs i find mention made of a district in the fair being unoccupied ubi homines cornubiae stare solebant  the whole reception to the bishop this year was    l   s  d more than  00l at this day ibid   different counties had their different stations  it appears from a curious record now remaining containing the establishment and expenses of the household of henry percy the  th earl of northumberland a d      and printed by dr percy that the stores of his lordships house at wresille for the whole year were laid in from fairs he that stands charged with my lords house for the houll yeir if he may possible shall be at all faires where the groice emptions shall be boughte for the house for the houll yeir as wine wax beiffes multons wheite and malt this proves that fairs still continued to be the principal marts for purchasing necessaries in large quantities which now are supplied by frequent trading towns and the mention of beisses and multons which are salted oxen and sheep shows that at so late a period they knew little of breeding cattle their ignorance is so important an article of husbandy is also an evidence that in the reign of king henry viii the state of population was much lower among us than we may imagine ibid  p  0

various yet common necessaries at the fair of sturbridge cambridgeshire at least  00 miles distant from either monastry  it may seem surprising that their own neighborhood including the cities of oxford and coventry could not supply them with commodities neither rare nor costly which they thus fetched at a considerable expense of carriage  there is a rubric in some of the monastic rules de cuntibus ad nundinas i e concerning those who go to fairs  our two annual fairs on the town moor newcastle are called lammass and st lukes fairs from the days on which they begin mr bourne tells us that the tolls booths stallage pickage and courts of pie powder dusty foot to each of these fairs were reckoned communibus annis   l in olivers time the records of our monasteries are lost otherwise they would doubtless have furnished some particulars relative to the institution and ancient customs of the fairs at newcastle  mr bailey tells us that in ancient times amongst christians upon any extraordinary solemnity particularly the anniversary dedication of a church festum nundinae quae in festis patronorum vulgo siunt du cange gloss  pitching pence was paid in fairs and markets for every bag of corn etc coals dict    tradesmen used to bring and sell their wares even in the churchyards especially upon the festival of the dedication as at westminster on st peters day at london on st bartholomew at durham on st cuthberts day etc but riots and disturbances often happening by reason of the numbers assembled together privileges were by royal charter granted for various causes to particular places towns and places of strength where magistrates presided to keep the people in order courts were granted to take notice of all manner of causes and disorders committed upon the place called piepowder poudre des piez french  dust of the feet  because justice was done to any injured person before the dust of the fair was off his feet it is customary at all fairs to present fairings which are gifts bought at these annual markets  ray has preserved two old english proverbs that relate to fairs men speak of the fair as things went with them there  as also to come a day after the fair kennett in his glossary to his parochial antiquities tells us that from the solemn feasting at wakes and fairs came the word fare provision good fare to fare well in verbo feriae  n b see also

description of some singular customs used in his time in franconia to which i have so often referred tells us that scholars on st nicholas day used to elect three out of their number one of whom was to play the bishop the others to act the parts of deacons  the bishop was escorted by the rest of the boys in solemn procession to church where with his mitre on he presided during the time of divine worship this being ended he with his deacons went about singing from door to door and collected money which they did not beg as alms but demanded as the bishops subsidy the boys were prevailed upon to fast on the eve of this day in order to persuade themselves that the little presents which on that night were put for them into shoes there is a festival or ceremony observed in italy called zopata from a spanish word signifying a shoe in the courts of certain princes on st nicholas day wherein persons hide presents in the shoes and slippers of those they do honor to in such manner as may surprise them on the morrow when they come to dress this is done in imitation of the practice of st nicholas who used in the night time to throw purses in at the windows of poor maids to be marriage portions for them vide bailey  placed under the table for that purpose were made them by their very bountiful prelate nicholas  on which account many of them kept the fast so rigourously that their friends were under the necessity of forcing them to take some sustenance in order to prevent them from injuring their health  the ancient calendar of the church of rome december   nicolao episcopo scholarum feriae reges ad aedem muneribus and pompa accedunt poetarum mos olim in schola ad pueros relatus regales in scholis epulae   has the following observations on this day which is the  th of december  december   nicholas bishop school holidays the kings go to church with presents and great show the ancient custom of poets in school related to the boys the kings feasts in schools vestiges of these ancient popish superstitions are still retained in several schools about this time of the year particularly in the grammar school at durham at salthill near windsor the eton boys have an annual custom in june of giving salt and extorting money from every one that passes by  the captain for so they style their leader is said to raise some years  00 pounds on this occasion all which he claims as his own they stop even the stage coaches  there is generally a great concourse of the nobility gentry etc at salthill on the day  this seems to be a fragment but greatly mutilated of the above described ancient customs in schools on st nicholas day  i received this information at the windmill one of the very elegant inns at salthill and if i mistake not the bedchamber in which i slept had a latin title montem above the chimneypiece that referred to the littlehill the scene of this singular custom    they ask and forcibly obtain from the master what they call orders  i have heard also of a similar custom at the school of houghtonlespring in the county of durham  of the gule of august commonly called lammassday lammasday says blount the first of august otherwise called the gule or yule of august which may be a corruption of the british word gwyl awst signifying the feast of august or may come from vincula chains that day being called in latin festum sancti petri ad vincula the last opinion seems a wild and vague conjecture how much more probable is the hypothesis of the learned gebelin which the reader will find both in the original french and translated into english if he will be at the trouble of turning back to page      antiquaries are divided also in their opinions concerning the origin of the word lam or lambmass  some suppose it is called lammassday we have an old proverb at latter lammass which is synomymous with the ad graecas calendas of the latins and the vulgar saying when two sundays come together i e never  quasi lambmasse because on that day the tenants that held lands of the cathedral church in york which is dedicated to saint peter ad vincula in the ancient calendar of the romish church i find the subsequent observation on the  st of august chains are worshipped etc catenae coluntur ad aram in exquiliis ad vicum cyprium juxta titi thermas   were bound by their tenure to bring a live lamb into the church at high mass on that day  others suppose it to be derived from the saxon hlaf maesse i e loaf mass or bread mass so named as a feast of thanksgiving to god for the first fruits of the corn and seems to have been observed with bread of new wheat and accordingly it is a usage in some places for tenants to be bound to bring in wheat of that year to their lord on or before the first of august ham resol to   quaeres p     vide blount  of the vulgar saying  under the rose doctor brown leaves me little more on this subject than the easy and agreeable task of making him speak concisely and in plain english  nazianzen says he seems to imply in the subsequent translated verses that the rose from a natural property has been made the symbol of silence  utque latet rosa verna suo putamine clausa sic os vincla ferat validisque arctetur habenis indicatque suis prolixa silentia labris hence it should seem when we desire to confine our words we commonly say they are spoken under the rose  there is a propriety in this expression also if we mean only in society at convivial entertainments where it was an ancient custom to wear chaplets of roses about the head  the germans have a custom of describing a rose in the ceiling over the table i shall favor my reader here with another curious observation of the learned author of the vulgar errors coral was thought to preserve and fasten the teeth in men yet is used in children to make an easier passage for them hence that wellknown toy with bells etc and coral at the end which is generally suspended from their necks this custom is supposed with the greatest probability to have had its origin in an ancient superstition which considered it as an amulet or defensative against fascination  for this we have the authority of pliny in the following words aruspices religiosum coralli gestamen amoliendis periculis arbitrantur et surculi infantiae alligati tutelam habere creduntur   lemnius and others have traced it to another origin the rose say they was the flower of venus which cupid consecrated to harpocrates the god of silence etc it was therefore an emblem of it to conceal the pranks of venery thus the poet ut rosa flos veneris cujus quo facta laterent harpocrati matris dona dicavit amor inde rosam mensis hospes suspendit amicis conviviae ut sub ea dicta tacenda sciant   of the silly how that is the holy or fortunate cap or hood various were the superstitions about half a century in scotland says the learned and modest author of the glossary to douglas virgil the women call a haly or sely how i e holy or fortunate cap or hood a film or membrane stretched over the heads of children new born which is nothing else but a part of that which covers the foetus in the womb and they give out that children so born will be very fortunate in verbo how  an instance of great fortune in one born with this coif is given by aelius lampridius in the history of diadumenos who came afterward to the sovereign dignity of the empire this superstition prevailed much in the primitive ages of the church st chrysostom in several of his homilies inveighs against it he is particularly severe against one praetus a clergyman who being desirous of being fortunate bought such a coif of a midwife see athenian oracle  it would be giving the reins up to fancy altogether to suppose that the present remarkable black spots in the wigs of those of the highest orders of the law owe their origin to this ancient superstition but i have no kind of doubt but that the word howdy used in the north for a midwife and which i take to be a diminitive of how is derived from this obsolete opinion of old women an etymon i have heard of howdy that is how do ye is not unlike the all eggs under of swift and forcibly satirizes that licentiousness of fancy in which many philologists have indulged themselves   ago concerning a certain membranous covering commonly called the silly how that was sometimes found about the heads of newborn infants  it was preserved with great care not only as medical in diseases but also as contributing to the good fortune of the infant and others  this says dr brown is no more than the continuation of a superstition that is of very remote antiquity thus we read in the life of antoninus by spartianus that children are sometimes born with this natural cap which midwives were wont to sell to credulous lawyers who held an opinion that it contributed to their promotion but to speak strictly continues our author the effect is natural and thus to be conceived the infant has three teguments or membranous filmes which cover it in the womb i e the corion amnios and allantois the corion is the outward membrane wherein are implanted the veins arteries and umbilical vessels whereby its nourishment is conveyed the allantois a thin coat seated under the corion wherein are received the watery separations conveyed by the urachus that the acrimony thereof should not offend the skin the amnios is a general investment containing the sudorous or thin serosity perspirable through the skin now about the time when the infant breaks these coverings it sometimes carries with it about the head a part of the amnios or nearest coat which says spiegelius either proceeds from the toughness of the membrane or weakness of the infant that cancot get clear thereof and therefore herein significations are natural and concluding upon the infant but not to be extended unto magical signalities or any other person   of the phenomenon blount tells us it is a certain viscous substance reflecting light in the dark evaporated out of a fat farth and flying in the air it commonly haunts churchyards privies and fens because it is begotten out of fatness it flies about rivers hedges etc because in those places there is a certain flux of air it follows one that follows it because the air does so  it is called ignis fatuus or foolish fire because it only fears fools hence is it when men are led away with some idle fancy or conceit we use to say an ignis fatuus has done it blount in verbo    vulgarly called will or kitty with the wisp wisp properly signifies a little twist of straw for the purpose of easing the head under the pressure of some heavy burden it is corrupted into weeze in the vulgar dialect of newcastle as also a handful of straw folded up a little to wipe any thing with thus in that very curious and scarce poem the visions of pierce plowman  and wished it had been wiped with a wisp of firses pass    it implies in the name of this phenomenon a kind of strawtorch thus junius in verbo frisiis wispien etiamnum est ardentes straminis fasciculos in altum tollere  these vulgar names are undoubtedly derived from its appearance as if will jack or kit some country fellows were going about with lighted strawtorches in their hands    or jack with a lanthorn how will a wisp misleads nightfaring clowns over hills and sinking bogs and pathless downs gay this appearance called in latin ignis fatuus has long been an article in the catalogue of popular superstitions it is said to be chiefly seen in summer nights frequenting meadows marshes and other moist places  it has been thought by some to arise from a viscous exhalation which being kindled in the air reflects a sort of thin flame in the dark without any sensible heat it is often found flying along rivers and hedges because as it is conjectured it meets there with a stream of air to direct it  philosophers are much divided in their solution of this phenomenon sir isaac newton says it is a vapor shining without heat and that there is the same difference between this vapor and flame as between rotten wood shining without heat and burning coals of fire  others suppose it to be some nocturnal flying insect indeed they have gone so many different ways in pursuit of this wanderer that according to the popular notion of its conducting into bogs and other precipices some of them must have been misled and bewildered by it  we may follow them however as far as we please in this paper pursuit without any danger  meiana has given us an accout of the famous indian lanthorn fly published amongst her insects at surinam it has a hood or bladder on its head which gives a light like a lanthorn in the night but by daylight is clear and transparent curiously adorned with stripes of red or green color  one may read writing of tolerable large character by it at night  the creature it is said can contract or dilate the hood or bladder over its head at pleasure  they hide all their light when taken but when at liberty afford it plentifully  it inclines one to think that the appearance under consideration is no more than the shining of some nightflying insect when we are informed that they give proof as it were of sense by avoiding objects  that they often go in a direction contrary to the wind  that they often seem extinct and then shine again  their passing along a few feet above the ground or surface of the water agrees with the motion of some insect in quest of prey as also their settling on a sudden and rising again immediately i subjoin what will perhaps be thought a curious extract concerning the appearance commonly called a falling star from

that ignes fatui are never seen but in salt marshes or other boggy places on the other hand it is proved that they have been seen flying over fields heaths and other dry places  i am informed in boremans second volume of his description of a great variety of animals vegetables etc etc that a respectable person in hertfordshire at astley seven miles from worcester three gentlemen saw one of these appearances in a garden about nine oclock in a dark night  at first they imagined it to be some country fellow with a lanthorn till approaching within about six yards it suddenly disappeared  it became visible again in a dry field thirty or forty yards off  it disappeared as suddenly a second time and was seen again a hundred yards off  whether it passed over the hedge or went through it could not be observed for it disappeared as it passed from field to field  at another time when one approached within ten or twelve yards it seemed to pack off as in a fright    presuming upon his knowledge of the grounds about his house was tempted one dark night to follow one of these lights which he saw flying over a piece of fallow ground  it led him over a plowed field flying and twisting about from place to place  sometimes it would suddenly disappear and as suddenly appear again  it once made directly to a hedge when it came near it mounted over and he lost sight after a full hours chase  in his return to his house he saw it again but was too fatigued to think of renewing the pursuit this light is said also to have been observed to stand still as well as to move and sometimes seemed fixed on the surface on the water  we are informed that in italy two kinds of these lights have been discovered one on the mountains the other on the plains  the common people call them cularsi

the cause under consideration and having found that their depositions by no means agree i shall not presume to sum up the evidence or pronounce sentence  we leave therefore the decision of the controversy to future discoveries in natural history and to the determination of succeeding times  of the borrowed days there is an old proverb preserved in rays collection   april borrows three days of march and they are ill  april is pronounced with an emphasis on the last syllable and so it is made into a kind of rhyme  i have taken notice of this because i find in the ancient calendar of the church of rome to which i have so often referred the following observations on the   st of march  the rustic fable concerning the nature of the month the rustic names of six days which shall follow in april or may be the last of march rustica fabula de natura mensis nomina rustica   dierum qui sequentur in aprili ceu ultimi sint martii   there is no doubt but that these observations in the ancient calendar and our proverb are derived from one common origin  i confess myself in the mean while unable to go any farther in tracing them back to their source  of cockfighting  quanquam in media jam morte tenentur non tamen disistunt martemve iramve remittunt magnanimi from a beautiful latin poem on this subject in the  d volume of the mulae anglicanae it is signed jo friend aedis christi alamnus   men have long availed themselves of the antipathy one cock shows to another and have encouraged that natural hatred with arts that disgrace human reason  the origin of this sport is said to be derived from the athenians on the following occasion when themistocles was marching his army against the persians he by the way espying two cocks fighting caused his army to behold them and made the following speech to them behold these do not fight for their household gods for the monuments of their ancestors nor for glory nor for liberty nor for the safety of their children but only because the one will not give way unto the other this so encouraged the grecians that they fought strenuously and obtained the victory over the persians upon which cockfighting was by a particular law ordained to be annually practiced by the athenians and hence was the original of the sport in england derived  thus i do not find his authority for this among the ancients it is not taken notice of by plutarch  neither does cornelius nepos mention any such incident in his memoir of themistocles far mr bailey  the best treatise on this subject is in the third volume of the archacologia by one i wish this ingenious gentlemans dissuasions against our barbarous sport may be found cogent enough to put an end to it  he has been happily successful in tracing its origin  who is an ornament to a society the institution of which does honor to our country  i shall give the reader something like a compendium of this excellent memoir  though the ancient greeks piqued themselves on their politeness calling all other nations barbarous yet mr pegge has proved clearly in this treatise that they were the authors of this cruel and inhuman mode of diversion  the inhabitants of delos were great lovers of this sport and tanagra a city of boeotia the isle of rhodes chalcis in euboea and the country of media were famous for their generous and magnanimous race of chickens  it appears they had some method of preparing the birds for battle the modern manner of preparing is thus described in the poem above cited  nec per agros sivit dulces ve errare per hortos ne venerc absumant natas ad praelia vires aut

and partly political at athens  socrates sacrificed a cock to aesculapius and was continued there for the purpose of improving the seeds of valor in the minds of their youth  but it was afterward abused and perverted both there and in other parts of greece to a common pastime and amusement without any moral political or religious intention and as it is now followed and practiced amongst us  it appears that the romans who borrowed this with many other things from greece used quails hence marcus aurelius   sect   says i learn from diognetus ne rebus inambus shedium impenderem ne coturnices ad pugnam alerem neve rebus istiusmodi animum adjcerem as well as cocks for fighting  the first cause of contention between the two brothers bassianus and geta sons of the emperor septimius severus

gladiators the fathers of the church inveigh with great warmth against the spectacles of the arena  the wanton shedding of human blood in sport  one would have thought that with this cockfighting would also have been discarded under the mild and humane genius of christianity  but it was reserved for this enlightened era to practice it with new and aggravating circumstances of cruelty  the

superstition of pythagoreans and bramins yet certainly we have no right no power or authority to abuse and torment any of gods creatures or needlessly to sport with their lives but on the contrary ought to use them with all possible tenderness and moderation  in a word cockfighting is an heathenish mode of diversion from the first and at this day ought certainly to be confined to barbarous nations yet it may and must be added to aggravate the matter and enhance our shame that our butchers have contrived a method unknown to the ancients of arming the heels of the bird with steel a device considered as a most noble improvement pliny mentions the spur and calls it telum but the castle is a mere modern invention as likewise is the great and i suppose necessary exactness in matching them  n b the asiatics however use spurs that act on each side like a lancet and which almost immediately decide the battle  hence they are never permitted by the modern cockfighters   in the art and indeed an invention highly worthy of men that delight in blood  it still continues to be a favorite sport of our colliers in the north in performing not long since the service appropriated to the visitation

the moon the ancient object of idolatrous worship has in later times composed an article in the creed of popular superstition the moon dr johnson tells us has great influence in vulgar philosophy in his memory he observes it was a precept annually given in one of the english almanacks to kill hogs when the moon was increasing and the bacon would prove the better in boiling  the common people bailey tells us in some counties in england are accustomed at the prime of the moon to say it is a fine moon god bless her which some imagine to proceed from a blind zeal retained from the ancient irish who worshipped the moon or from a custom in scotland particularly in the highlands where the women make a curtesy to the new moon and some english women still retain a touch of this gentilism who getting up upon and sitting astride on a gate or style the first night of the new moon say all hail to the moon all hail to thee i prithee good moon declare to me this night who my husband shall be   the ancient druids had their superstitious rites at the changes of the moon  the hornedness of the new moon is still faintly considered by the vulgar as an omen with regard to the weather  the rev mr shaw in his account of elgin and the shire of murray see appendix to pennants tour informs us that at the full moon in march they cut withes of the misletoe or ivy make circles of them keep them all the year and pretend to cure hectics and other troubles by them  dr johnson in his journey to the western islands tells us they expect better crops of grain by sowing their seed in the moons increase  of second sight the learned author of the rambler having favored the public with his thoughts on this singular kind of superstition and having so lately visited the scene of its declining influence it will be unnecessary to apologize for using his own words on the subject we should have had little claim says he to the praise of curiosity if we had not endeavored with particular attention to examine the question of the second sight of an opinion received for centuries by a whole nation and supposed to be confirmed through its whole descent by a series of successive facts it is desirable that the truth should be established or the fallacy detected  the second sight is an impression made either by the mind upon the eye or by the eye upon the mind by which things distant or future are perceived and seen as if they were present a man on a journey far from home falls from his horse another who is perhaps at work about the house sees him bleeding upon the ground commonly with a landscape of the place where the accident befalls him another seer driving home his cattle or wandering in idleness or musing in the sunshine is suddenly surprised by the appearance of a bridal ceremony or funeral procession and counts the mourners or attendants of whom if he knows them he relates the names if he knows them not he can describe the dresses things distant are seen at the instant when they happen of things future i know not that there is any rule for determining the time between the sight and the event  this receptive faculty for power it cannot be called is neither voluntary nor constant the appearances have no dependence upon choice they cannot be summoned detained or recalled the impression is sudden and the effect often painful  by the term second sight seems to be meant a mode of seeing superadded to that which nature generally bestows in the earse it is called taisch which signifies likewise a spectre or a vision i know not nor is it likely that the highlanders ever examined whether by taisch used for the second sight they mean the power of seeing or the thing seen  i do not find it to be true as it is reported that to the second sight nothing is presented but phantoms of evil good seems to have the same proportion in those visionary scenes as it obtains in real life almost all remarkable events have evil for their basis and are either miseries incurred or miseries escaped our sense is so much stronger of what we suffer than of what we enjoy that the ideas of pain predominate in almost every mind what is recollection but a revival of vexations or history but a record of wars treasons and calamities death which is considered as the greatest evil happens to all the greatest good be it what it will is the lot but of a part  that they should often see death is to be expected because death is an event frequent and important but they see likewise more pleasing incidents a gentleman told me that when he had once gone far from his own island one of his laboring servants predicted his return and described the livery of his attendant which he had never worn at home and which had been without any previous design occasionally given him  our desire of information was keen and our inquiry frequent mr boswells frankness and gaiety made every body communicative and we heard many tales of these airy shows with more or less evidence and distinctness  it is the common talk of the lowland scots that the notion of the second sight is wearing away with other superstitions and that its reality is no longer supposed but by the grossest people how far its prevalence ever extended or what ground it has lost i know not the islanders of all degrees whether of rank or understanding universally admit it except the ministers who universally deny it and are suspected to deny it in consequence of a system against conviction one of them honestly told me that he came to sky with a resolution not to believe it  strong reasons for incredulity will readily occur this faculty of seeing things out of sight is local and commonly useless it is a breach of the common order of things without any visible reason or perceptible benefit it is ascribed only to a people very little enlightened and among them for the most part to the mean and the ignorant  to the confidence of these objections it may be replied that by presuming to determine what is fit and what is beneficial they presuppose more knowledge of the universal system than man has attained and therefore depend upon principles too complicated and extensive for our comprehension and that there can be no security in the consequence when the premises are not understood that the second sight is only wonderful because it is rare for considered in itself it involves no more difficulty than dreams or perhaps than the regular exercises of the cogitative faculty that a general opinion of communicative impulses or visionary representations has prevailed in all ages and all nations that particular instances have been given with such evidence as neither bacon nor bail has been able to resist that sudden impressions which the event has verified have been felt by more than own or publish them that the second sight of the hebrides implies only the local frequency of a power which is nowhere totally unknown and that where we are unable to decide by antecedent reason we must be content to yield to the force of testimony  by pretension to second sight no profit was ever sought or gained it is an involuntary affection in which neither hope nor fear are known to have any part those who profess to feel it do not boast of it as a privilege nor are considered by others as advantageously distinguished they have no temptation to feign and their hearers have no motive to encourage the imposture  to talk with any of these seers is not easy there is one in sky with whom we would have gladly conversed but he was very gross and ignorant and knew no english the proportion in these countries of the poor to the rich is such that if we suppose the quality to be accidental it can very rarely happen to a man of education and yet on such men it has sometimes fallen there is now a second sighted gentleman in the highlands who complains of the terrors to which he is exposed  the foresight of the seers is not always prescience they are impressed with images of which the event only shows them the meaning they tell what they have seen to others who are at that time not more knowing than themselves but may become at last very adequate witnesses by comparing the narrative with its verification  to collect sufficient testimonies for the satisfaction of the public or ourselves would have required more time than we could bestow there is against it the seeming analogy of things confusedly seen and little understood and for it the indistinct cry of national persuasion which may be perhaps resolved at last into prejudice and tradition i never could advance my curiosity to conviction but came away at last only willing to believe  of dreams every dream according to wolfius takes its rise from some sensation and is continued by the succession of phantasms in the mind his reasons are that when we dream we imagine something or the mind produces phantasms but no phantasms can arise in the mind without a previous sensation hence neither can a dream arise without some previous sensation  lord bacon observes that the interpretation of natural dreams has been much labored but mixed with numerous extravagancies and adds that at present it stands not upon its best foundation it may be observed that in our days except amongst the most ignorant and vulgar the whole imaginary structure is fallen to the ground  physicians seem to be the only persons at present who interpret dreams frightful dreams are perhaps always indications of some violent oppression of nature hippocrates has may curious observations on dreams ennius of old has made that very sensible remark that what men studied and pondered in the day time the same they dreamed on at night i suppose there are few who cannot from their own experience assent to the truth of his observation  various are the popular superstitions or at least the faint traces of them that yet are made use of to procure dreams of divination such as fasting st agnes festum s agnetis celebrari

supposed to mean any ill by it are aware that it is synonymous with sending you to the devil yet is it undoubtedly of equal import with the latin abi in malam rem dusius quoniam creberrima fama est

possible to be prevented later times have done both these devils justice heartily supposing them to have been much traduced by a certain set of delinquents who used to father upon invisible and imaginary agents the crimes of real men  of the long poles which are used as signs to barbers shops barbers shops are generally marked by long poles instead of signs the athenian oracle accounts for this custom which is of remote antiquity in the following manner the barbers art was so beneficial to the public that he who first brought it up in rome had as authors relate a statue erected to his memory in england they were in some sort the surgeons of old times into whose art those beautiful leeches an old word for a doctor or a surgeon  our fair virgins then too used to be initiated thus in corporate towns the present companies of barberchirurgeons they therefore used to hang their basins out upon poles to make known at a distance to the weary and wounded traveller i am better pleased with the subsequent ingenious cojecture which i take the liberty of extracting from the antiquarian repertory the barbers pole has been the subject of many conjectures some conceiving it to have originated from the word poll or head with several other conceits as far fetched and as unmeaning but the true intention of that partycolored staff was to show the master of the shop practiced surgery

encompasses the staff was meant to represent the phillet thus elegantly twined about it p  0  where all might have recourse they used poles as some inns still gibbet their signs across a town  gypsies

brown remarks upon this legend which as it has been an article of the peoples belief merited some consideration sure were this true the wandering jew might be a happy arbitrator in many christian controversies but must unpardonably condemn the obstinacy of the jews who can contemn the rhetoric of such miracles and blindly behold so living and lasting conversions tells us the story of the wandering jew is of considerable antiquity it had obtained full credit in this part of the world before the year      as we learn from matt paris for in that year it seems there came an armenian archbishop into england to visit the shrines and relics preserved in our churches who being entertained at the monastry of st albans was asked several questions relating to his country etc among the rest a monk who sat near him enquired if he had ever seen or heard of the famous person named joseph that was so much talked of who was present at our lords crucifixion and conversed with him and who was still alive in confirmation of the christian faith the archbishop answered that the fact was true and afterward one of his train who was well known to a servant of the abbots interpreting his masters words told them in french that his lord knew the person they spoke of very well that he dined at his table but a little while before he left the east that he had been pontius pilates porter by name cartaphilus who when they were dragging jesus out of the door of the judgmenthall struck him with his fist on the back saying go faster jesus go faster why do thou linger upon which jesus looked at him with a frown and said i indeed am going but thou shall tarry till i come soon after he was converted and baptized by the name of joseph he lives for ever but at the end of every hundred years falls into an incurable illness and at length into a fit of extacy out of which when he recovers he returns to the same state of youth he was in when jesus suffered being then about thirty years of age he remembers all the circumstances of the death and resurrection of christ the saints that arose with him the composing of the apostles creed their preaching and dispersion and is himself a very grave and holy person this is the substance of m paris account who was himself a monk at st albans and was living at the time when this armenian archbishop made the above relation since his time several impostors have appeared at intervals under the name and character of the wandering jew see calmets dict of bible turkish spy vol   b   let    we had one of these impostors not many years ago

personal courage metaphorically from the pushing of animals is intimated by horns whence is it then that a custom has prevailed almost universally of saying that the unhappy husbands of false women wear horns or are cornutes it may be said almost universally for we are told that even among the indians it was the highest indignity that could be offered them even to point at a horn  in spain it is a crime as much punishable by the laws to put up horns against a neighbors house as to have written a libel against him there is a great parade of learning on the subject of this very serious jest in

needs be who can sit down tamely under so great an insult  a conjecture this that is perhaps worthy of some of our english etymologists who in matters that required the deepest exertion of the

hegoat a ducenda uxore valde abhorreo quia gentem barbatulam hircosamque progeniem pertremisco elysius jucund quest camp      who will stand looking on while others possess his female staung eboracensibus est lignum ablongum contus bajulorum hicks there was an ancient custom of riding the stang when one in derision is made to ride on a pole for his neighbors wifes fault see glossary to gaw douglas virgil  and aldrovandus accounts for this by telling us that this very salacious animal is debilitated by his excesses before he is six years old after which period as if conscious of his own impotence he will molest no rival this too has been exploded for it has been proved that this animal is equally jealous with and will fight like others on such an occasion  another conjecture is that some mean husbands availing themselves of their wives beauty have turned it to account by prostituting them obtaining by this means the horn pauper erat sieri vult dives quaerit et unde vendidit uxorem naenius emit agrum martial epigram of amalthea the cornucopia which if i mistake not is called in the language of modern gallantry tipping the horns with gold there seems to be a great deal of probability in this surmise pancirollus on the other hand derives it from a custom of the debauched emperor andronicus who used to hang up in a frolic in the porticos of the forum the stags horns he had taken in hunting intending as he says by this new kind of insignia to denote at once the manners of the city the lasciviousness of the wives he had debauched and the size of the animals he had made his prey and that from hence the sarcasm spread abroad that the husband of an adulterous wife bare horns  i am not satisfied with this last account all one gathers from it seems to be that what andronicus did was a continuation not the origin of this custom as to the word cuckold pliny tells us that vinedressers were anciently called cuckows i e slothful because they deferred cutting their vines till that bird began to sing which was later than the right time so that the same name may have been given to the unhappy persons under consideration when through disregard and neglect of their fair partners they have caused them to go a gadding in search of more diligent and industrous companions  it is plainly from the latin cuculus the cuckoo a bird that as aristotle says builds no nest herself but deposits her eggs in that of some other bird who hatches and adopts her offspring as the mari cocu french for cuckold does the children who are none of his  i must conclude this subject with an apology it is not of the most delicate kind yet in speaking of popular antiquities it seemed incumbent upon me to say something about it  to jest concerning a crime which is replete with every evil to society is indeed to scatter firesbrands and arrows in our sport it may be added there is no philosophical justice in such insults if the husband was not to blame it is highly ungenerous and an instance of that common meanness in life of confounding a persons misfortunes with his faults the cruelty of such wanton reflections will appear if we consider that a man plagued with a vicious wife needs no aggravation of his misery  first of april allfools day hunc jocus  mensem vindicat hunc risus et sine fell sales buchanan a custom says the spectator prevails every where among us on the first of april when every body strives to make as many fools as he can the wit chiefly consists in sending persons on what are called sleeveless skinner guesses this to mean a lifeless errand i am not satisfied with this etymon he assigns no cause for his conjecture  this epithet is found in chaucer errands for the history of eves mother for pigeon milk with similar ridiculous absurdities he takes no notice of the rise of this singular kind of anniversary this is generally called allfools day a corruption it should seem of auld i e oldfools day in confirmation of which opinion i quote an observation on the first of vide hallow even or nutcrack night november in the ancient roman calendar so often cited the feast of old fools i find in poor robins almanac for    0 a pleasant and what is meant for a poetical description of the modern fooleries on the  st of april with the open avowal of being ignorant of the origin of them the first of april some do say is set apart for allfools day but why the people call it so nor i nor they themselves do know but on this day are people sent on purpose for pure merriment and though the day is known before yet frequently there is great store of these forgetfuls to be found who are sent to dance moll dixons round and having tried each shop and stall and disappointed at them all at last some tells them of the cheat then they return from their pursuit and straightway home with shame they run and others laugh at what is done but it is a thing to be disputed which is the greatest fool reputed the man that innocently went or he that him designdly sent  is removed to this day this old fools seems to denote it to be a different day from the feast of fools which was held on the first of january of which a particular description may be found in du canges learned glossary in verbo kalendae see new years day all our antiquaries that i have had the opportunity of consulting are silent concerning the first of april it owes its beginning probably to a removal which was of frequent use in the crowded roman calendar and of which i have just now adduced a seemingly apposite instance there is nothing hardly says the author of the essay to retrieve the ancient celtic that will bear a clearer demonstration than that the primitive christians by way of conciliating the pagans to a better worship humoured their prejudices by yielding to a conformity of names this writer contends that the ancient druidical religion of britain and the gauls had its pope its cardinals its bishops its deacons etc  and even of customs where they did not essentially interfere with the fundamentals of the gospel doctrine this was done in order to quiet their possession and to secure their tenure an admirable expedient and extremely fit in those barbarous times to prevent the people from returning to their old religion among these in imitation of the roman saturnalia was the festum fatuorum when part of the jollity of the season was a burlesque election of a mock pope mock cardinals mock bishops andrew says this writer signifies a head druid or divine hence it was that when the christians by way of exploding the druids turned them into ridicule in their feast or holiday of fools one of the buffoon personages was a merry andrew this name is usually but as erroneously as it should seem from this writers explication derived from the greek where it signifies manly or courageous from the contrarieties in the definitions of etymologists philology seems but too justly to bear the reproachful title of eruditio ad libitum science that we twist and turn at pleasure  attended says he with a thousand ridiculous and indecent ceremonies gambols and antics such as singing and dancing in the churches in lewd attitudes to ludicrous anthems all allusively to the exploded pretensions of the druids whom these sports were calculated to expose to scorn and derision this feast of fools had continues he its designed effect and contributed perhaps more to the extermination of those heathens than all the collateral aids of fire and sword neither of which were spared in the persecution of them the continuance of customs especially droll ones which suit the gross taste of the multitude after the original cause of them has ceased is a great but no uncommon absurdity  our epithet we in the north call persons who are thus deceived aprilgowks  a gowk is properly a cuckoo and is used here metaphorically in vulgar language for a fool the cuckoo is indeed every where a name of contempt gauch teutonic is rendered stultus fool whence also our northern word a goke or a gawky  vide skinner in verbo a vulgar superstition still prevails here concerning the cuckoo it is thought very unlucky to have no money about ones person on hearing this bird for the first time in a season  mr gay mentions thus in his spell another popular superstition a species of divination amongst lovers on the occasion  when first the year i heard the cuckoo sing and call with welcome notes the budding spring i straightway set a running with such haste debrah that won the smock scarce ran so fast till spent for lack of breath quite weary grown upon a rising bank i sat me down then doffd my shoe and by my troth i swear therein i spied this yellow frizzled hair as like to lubberkins in curl and hue as if upon his comely pate it grew  of old fools in the northern and old english auld does not ill accord with the pictures of druids transmitted to us the united appearances of age sanctity and wisdom which these ancient priests assumed doubtless contributed not a little to the deception of the people  the christian teachers in their labors to undeceive the fettered multitudes would probably spare no pains to pull off the mask from these venerable hypocrites and point out to their converts that age was not always synonymous with wisdom that youth was not the peculiar period of folly but that with young ones there were also old auld fools  the reader must content himself with this explication which i think not an improbable one at least till a better can be found in joining the scattered fragments that survive the mutilation of ancient customs we must be forgiven if all the parts are not found closely to agree little of the means of information is transmitted to us that little can only be eked out by conjecture  i have sometimes thought that the obsolete sports of the ancient hoctide an old saxon word importing the time of scorning or triumphing if i were asked to turn this fools day into latin methinks it could not be more aptly rendered than by  dies irrisorius  and so i find some of our best antiquaries translate the saxon word hucxdaeg  which must have been about this time of the year might have degenerated into the april fooleries but i find no authority for this supposition and insert it as a mere conjecture  hoke day hardeknuto mortuo liberata est anglia extunc a servitute danorum in cujus

number of rags tied to the branches these were so many charms which passengers coming from ghilan a province remarkable for agues had left there in a fond expectation of leaving their disease also on

under pillows in the north for the same purpose with those of the bridecake the bridecake is here sometimes broken over the brides head and then thrown among the crowd to be scrambled for  it would be

toast page     add in the tatler vol   no    it is said that the word in its present sense had its rise from an accident at the town of bath in the reign of charles the iid it happened that on a public day a celebrated beauty of those times was in the cross bath and one of the crowd of her admirers took a glass of the water in which the fair one stood and drank her health to the company there was in the place a gay fellow half fuddled who offered to jump in and swore though he liked not the liquor he would have the toast he was opposed in his resolution yet this whim gave foundation to the present honor which is done to the lady we mention in our liquor who has ever since been called a toast  i am not able to controvert this account but am by no means satisfied with it  the wit here is likelier to have been a consequence than the cause of this singular use of the word it puts one in mind of the wellknown reply of a mr brown in some late jest book who on having it observed to him that he had given a certain lady a long while for his toast answered yes but i have not been able to toast her brown yet  archbishop tillotson tells us that in all probability those common juggling

mistake not in hawksworths voyges that the top is known among the indians some of whom pointed to our sailors who seemed to wonder at seeing it amongst them that in order to make it spin they should lash it with a whip  blindmans buff is thus described by gay as once i played at blindmans buff it hapt about my eyes the towel thick was wrapped i missed the swain and seized on blouzalind true
